The Real Slim Shady;Eminem;hip-hop;May I have your attention, please? May I have your attention, please? Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? I repeat Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? We're gonna have a problem here   Y'all act like you never seen a white person before Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door And started whoopin' her ass worse than before They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh) It's the return of the"Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?" And Dr. Dre said Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha) Feminist women love Eminem "Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady,I'm sick of him Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what Flippin' the you-know-who", "Yeah, but he's so cute though" Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose "My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips" And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss And that's the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is By the time they hit fourth gradethey've got the Discovery Channel, don't they? We ain't nothin' but mammals Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes See Eminem LiveGet tickets as low as $190You might also like I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope) Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too You think I give a damn about a Grammy? Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me "But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?" Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here? So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears? Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first Little bitch put me on blast on MTV "Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee" I should download her audio on MP3 And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh) I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me So I have been sent here to destroy you And there's a million of us just like me Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me  'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?

It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin' He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh) Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck!" With his windows down and his system up So will the real Shady please stand up And put one of those fingers on each hand up? And be proud to be out of your mind and out of control And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
