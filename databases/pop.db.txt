She's Out of My Life - Single Version;Michael Jackson;pop;She's out of my life And I don't know whether to laugh or cry I don't know whether to live or die And it cuts like a knife She's out of my life  It's out of my hands It's out of my hands To think for two years she was here And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier Now the way that it stands She's out of my hands  And so I've learned that love it's not possession And I've learned that love don't wait Now I've learned that love needs expression But I learned too late  And she's... out of my life She's out of my life Damned indecision and cursed pride I kept my love for her locked, deep inside And it cuts like a knife She's out of my... lifeYou might also likeEmbed;

Cream - Without Rap Monologue;Prince;pop; NAMES OF PEOPLE: THE DUCHESSE DE GUERMANTES � SAINT-LOUP AT DONCI�RES � MME. DE VILLEPARISIS AT HOME � MY GRANDMOTHER�S ILLNESS � BERGOTTE�S ILLNESS � THE DUKE AND THE DOCTOR � DECLINE AND DEATH OF MY GRANDMOTHER.  ���The twittering of the birds at daybreak sounded insipid to Fran�oise. Every word uttered by the maids upstairs made her jump; disturbed by all their running about, she kept asking herself what they could be doing. In other words, we had moved. Certainly the servants had made no less noise in the attics of our old home; but she knew them, she had made of their comings and goings familiar events. Now she faced even silence with a strained attention. And as our new neighbourhood appeared to be as quiet as the boulevard on to which we had hitherto looked had been noisy, the song (distinct at a distance, when it was still quite faint, like an orchestralmotif) of a passer-by brought tears to the eyes of a Fran�oise in exile. And so if I had been tempted to laugh at her in her misery at having to leave a house in which she was �so well respected on all sides� and had packed her trunks with tears, according to the Use of Combray, declaring superior to all possible houses that which had been ours, on the other hand I, who found it as hard to assimilate new as I found it easy to abandon old conditions, I felt myself drawn towards our old servant when I saw that this installation of herself in a building where she had not received from the hall-porter, who did not yet know us, the marks of respect necessary to her moral wellbeing, had brought her positively to the verge of dissolution. She alone could understand what I was feeling; certainly her young footman was not the person to do so; for him, who was as unlike the Combray type as it was possible to conceive, packing up, moving, living in another district, were all like taking a holiday in which the novelty of one�s surroundings gave one the same sense of refreshment as if one had actually travelled; he thought he was in the country; and a cold in the head afforded him, as though he had been sitting in a draughty railway carriage, the delicious sensation of having seen the world; at each fresh sneeze he rejoiced that he had found so smart a place, having always longed to be with people who travelled a lot. And so, without giving him a thought, I went straight to Fran�oise, who, in return for my having laughed at her tears over a removal which had left me cold, now shewed an icy indifference to my sorrow, but because she shared it. The �sensibility� claimed by neurotic people is matched by their egotism; they cannot abide the flaunting by others of the sufferings to which they pay an ever increasing attention in themselves. Fran�oise, who would not allow the least of her own ailments to pass unnoticed, if I were in pain would turn her head from me so that I should not have the satisfaction of seeing my sufferings pitied, or so much as observed. It was the same as soon as I tried to speak to her about our new house. Moreover, having been obliged, a day or two later, to return to the house we had just left, to retrieve some clothes which had been overlooked in our removal, while I, as a result of it, had still a �temperature,� and like a boa constrictor that has just swallowed an ox felt myself painfully distended by the sight of a long trunk which my eyes had still to digest, Fran�oise, with true feminine inconstancy, came back saying that she had really thought she would stifle on our old boulevard, it was so stuffy, that she had found it quite a day�s journey to get there, that never had she seen such stairs, that she would not go back to live there for a king�s ransom, not if you were to offer her millions � a pure hypothesis � and that everything (everything, that is to say, to do with the kitchen and �usual offices�) was much better fitted up in the new house. Which, it is high time now that the reader should be told � and told also that we had moved into it because my grandmother, not having been at all well (though we took care to keep this reason from her), was in need of better air � was a flat forming part of the H�tel de Guermantes.  ���At the age when a Name, offering us an image of the unknowable which we have poured into its mould, while at the same moment it connotes for us also an existing place, forces us accordingly to identify one with the other to such a point that we set out to seek in a city for a soul which it cannot embody but which we have no longer the power to expel from the sound of its name, it is not only to towns and rivers that names give an individuality, as do allegorical paintings, it is not only the physical universe which they pattern with differences, people with marvels, there is the social universe also; and so every historic house, in town or country, has its lady or its fairy, as every forest has its spirit, as there is a nymph for every stream. Sometimes, hidden in the heart of its name, the fairy is transformed to suit the life of our imagination by which she lives; thus it was that the atmosphere in which Mme. de Guermantes existed in me, after having been for years no more than the shadow cast by a magic lantern slide or the light falling through a painted window, began to let its colours fade when quite other dreams impregnated it with the bubbling coolness of her flowing streams.  ���And yet the fairy must perish if we come in contact with the real person to whom her name corresponds, for that person the name then begins to reflect, and she has in her nothing of the fairy; the fairy may revive if we remove ourself from the person, but if we remain in her presence the fairy definitely dies and with her the name, as happened to the family of Lusignan, which was fated to become extinct on the day when the fairy M�lusine should disappear. Then the Name, beneath our successive �restorations� of which we may end by finding, as their original, the beautiful portrait of a strange lady whom we are never to meet, is nothing more than the mere photograph, for identification, to which we refer in order to decide whether we know, whether or not we ought to bow to a person who passes us in the street. But let a sensation from a bygone year � like those recording instruments which preserve the sound and the manner of the various artists who have sung or played into them � enable our memory to make us hear that name with the particular ring with which it then sounded in our ears, then, while the name itself has apparently not changed, we feel the distance that separates the dreams which at different times its same syllables have meant to us. For a moment, from the clear echo of its warbling in some distant spring, we can extract, as from the little tubes which we use in painting, the exact, forgotten, mysterious, fresh tint of the days which we had believed ourself to be recalling, when, like a bad painter, we were giving to the whole of our past, spread out on the same canvas, the tones, conventional and all alike, of our unprompted memory. Whereas on the contrary, each of the moments that composed it employed, for an original creation, in a matchless harmony, the colour of those days which we no longer know, and which, for that matter, will still suddenly enrapture me if by any chance the name �Guermantes,� resuming for a moment, after all these years, the sound, so different from its sound to-day, which it had for me on the day of Mile. Percepied�s marriage, brings back to me that mauve � so delicate, almost too bright, too new � with which the billowy scarf of the young Duchess glowed, and, like two periwinkle flowers, growing beyond reach and blossoming now again, her two eyes, sunlit with an azure smile. And the name Guermantes of those days is also like one of those little balloons which have been filled wilh oxygen, or some such gas; when I come to explode it, to make it emit what it contains, I breathe the air of the Combray of that year, of that day, mingled with a fragrance of hawthorn blossom blown by the wind from the corner of the square, harbinger of rain, which now sent the sun packing, now let him spread himself over the red woollen carpet to the sacristy, steeping it in a bright geranium scarlet, with that, so to speak, Wagnerian harmony in its gaiety which makes the wedding service always impressive. But even apart from rare moments such as these, in which suddenly we feel the original entity quiver and resume its form, carve itself out of the syllables now soundless, dead; if, in the giddy rush of daily life, in which they serve only the most practical purposes, names have lost all their colour, like a prismatic top that spins too quickly and seems only grey, when, on the other hand, in our musings we reflect, we seek, so as to return to the past, to slacken, to suspend the perpetual motion by which we are borne alcng, gradually we see once more appear, side by side, but entirely distinct from one another, the tints which in the course of our existence have been successively presented to us by a single name.  ���What form was assumed in my mind by this name Guermantes when my first nurse � knowing no more, probably, than I know to-day in whose honour it had been composed � sang me to sleep with that old ditty, Gloire � la Marquise de Guermantes, or when, some years later, the veteran Mar�chal de Guermantes, making my nursery-maid�s bosom swell with pride, stopped in the Champs-Elys�es to remark: �A fine child that!� and gave me a chocolate drop from his comfit-box, I cannot, of course, now say. Those years of my earliest childhood are no longer a part of myself; they are external to me; I can learn nothing of them save as we learn things that happened before we were born � from the accounts given me by other people. But more recently I find in the period of that name�s occupation of me seven or eight different shapes which it has successively assumed; the earliest were the most beautiful; gradually my musings, forced by reality to abandon a position that was no longer tenable, established themselves anew in one slightly less advanced until they were obliged to retire still farther. And, with Mme. de Guermantes, was transformed simultaneously her dwelling, itself also the offspring of that name, fertilised from year to year by some word or other that came to my ears and modulated the tone of my musings; that dwelling of hers reflected them in its very stones, which had turned to mirrors, like the surface of a cloud or of a lake. A dungeon keep without mass, no more indeed than a band of orange light from the summit of which the lord and his lady dealt out life and death to their vassals, had given place � right at the end of that �Guermantes way� along which, on so many summer afternoons, I retraced with my parents the course of the Vivonne � to that land of bubbling streams where the Duchess taught me to fish for trout and to know the names of the flowers whose red and purple clusters adorned the walls of the neighbouring gardens; then it had been the ancient heritage, famous in song and story, from which the proud race of Guermantes, like a carved and mellow tower that traverses the ages, had risen already over France when the sky was still empty at those points where, later, were to rise Notre Dame of Paris and Notre Dame of Chartres, when on the summit of the hill of Laon the nave of its cathedral had not yet been poised, like the Ark of the Deluge on the summit of Mount Ararat, crowded with Patriarchs and Judges anxiously leaning from its windows to see whether the wrath of God were yet appeased, carrying with it the types of the vegetation that was to multiply on the earth, brimming over with animals which have escaped even by the towers, where oxen grazing calmly upon the roof look down over the plains of Champagne; when the traveller who left Beauvais at the close of day did not yet see, following him and turning with his road, outspread against the gilded screen of the western sky, the black, ribbed wings of the cathedral. It was, this �Guermantes,� like the scene of a novel, an imaginary landscape which I could with difficulty picture to myself and longed all the more to discover, set in the midst of real lands and roads which all of a sudden would become alive with heraldic details, within a few miles of a railway station; I recalled the names of the places round it as if they had been situated at the foot of Parnassus or of Helicon, and they seemed precious to me, as the physical conditions � in the realm of topographical science � required for the production of an unaccountable phenomenon. I saw again the escutcheons blazoned beneath the windows of Combray church; their quarters filled, century after century, with all the lordships which, by marriage or conquest, this illustrious house had brought flying to it from all the corners of Germany, Italy and France; vast territories in the North, strong cities in the South, assembled there to group themselves in Guermantes, and, losing their material quality, to inscribe allegorically their dungeon vert, or castle triple-towered argent upon its azure field. I had heard of the famous tapestries of Guermantes, I could see them, mediaeval and blue, a trifle coarse, detach themselves like a floating cloud from the legendary, amaranthine name at the foot of the ancient forest in which Childebert went so often hunting; and this delicate, mysterious background of their lands, this vista of the ages, it seemed to me that, as effectively as by journeying to see them, I might penetrate all their secrets simply by coming in contact for a moment in Paris with Mme. de Guermantes, the princess paramount of the place and lady of the lake, as if her face, her speech must possess the local charm of forest groves and streams, and the same secular peculiarities as the old customs recorded in her archives. But then I had met Saint-Loup; he had told me that the castle had borne the name of Guermantes only since the seventeenth century, when that family had acquired it. They had lived, until then, in the neighbourhood, but their title was not taken from those parts. The village of Guermantes had received its name from the castle round which it had been built, and so that it should not destroy the view from the castle, a servitude, still in force, traced the line of its streets and limited the height of its houses. As for the tapestries, they were by Boucher, bought in the nineteenth century by a Guermantes with a taste for the arts, and hung, interspersed with a number of sporting pictures of no merit which he himself had painted, in a hideous drawing-room upholstered in �adrianople� and plush. By these revelations Saint-Loup had introduced into the castle elements foreign to the name of Guermantes which made it impossible for me to continue to extract solely from the resonance of the syllables the stone and mortar of its walls. And so, in the heart of the name, was effaced the castle mirrored in its lake, and what now became apparent to me, surrounding Mme. de Guermantes as her dwelling, had been her house in Paris, the H�tel de Guermantes, limpid like its name, for no material and opaque element intervened to interrupt and blind its transparence. As the word church signifies not only the temple but the assembly of the faithful also, this H�tel de Guermantes comprised all those who shared the life of the Duchess, but these intimates on whom I had never set eyes were for me only famous and poetic names, and knowing exclusively persons who themselves also were names only, did but enhance and protect the mystery of the Duchess by extending all round her a vast halo which at the most declined in brilliance as its circumference increased.  ���In the parties which she gave, since I could not imagine the guests as having any bodies, any moustaches, any boots, as making any utterances that were commonplace, or even original in a human and rational way, this whirlpool of names, introducing less material substance than would a phantom banquet or a spectral ball, round that statuette in Dresden china which was Madame de Guermantes, kept for her palace of glass the transparence of a showcase. Then, after Saint-Loup had told me various anecdotes about his cousin�s chaplain, her gardener, and the rest, the H�tel de Guermantes had become � as the Louvre might have been in days gone by � a kind of castle, surrounded, in the very heart of Paris, by its own domains, acquired by inheritance, by virtue of an ancient right that had quaintly survived, over which she still enjoyed feudal privileges. But this last dwelling itself vanished when we had come to live beside Mme. de Villeparisis in one of the flats adjoining that occupied by Mme. de Guermantes in a wing of the H�tel. It was one of those old town houses, a few of which are perhaps still to be found, in which the court of honour � whether they were alluvial deposits washed there by the rising tide of democracy, or a legacy from a more primitive time when the different trades were clustered round the overlord � is flanked by little shops and workrooms, a shoemaker�s, for instance, or a tailor�s, such as we see nestling between the buttresses of those cathedrals which the aesthetic zeal of the restorer has not swept clear of such accretions; a porter who also does cobbling, keeps hens, grows flowers, and, at the far end, in the main building, a �Comtesse� who, when she drives out in her old carriage and pair, flaunting on her hat a few nasturtiums which seem to have escaped from the plot by the porter�s lodge (with, by the coachman�s side on the box, a footman who gets down to leave cards at every aristocratic mansion in the neighbourhood), scatters vague little smiles and waves her hand in greeting to the porter�s children and to such of her respectable fellow-tenants as may happen to be passing, who, to her contemptuous affability and levelling pride, seem all the same.  ���In the house in which we had now come to live, the great lady at the end of the courtyard was a Duchess, smart and still quite young. She was, in fact, Mme. de Guermantes and, thanks to Fran�oise, I soon came to know all about her household. For the Guermantes (to whom Fran�oise regularly alluded as the people �below,� or �downstairs�) were her constant preoccupation from the first thing in the morning when, as she did Mamma�s hair, casting a forbidden, irresistible, furtive glance down into the courtyard, she would say: �Look at that, now; a pair of holy Sisters; that�ll be for downstairs, surely;� or, �Oh! just look at the fine pheasants in the kitchen window; no need to ask where they came from, the Duke will have been out with his gun!�� until the last thing at night when, if her ear, while she was putting out my night-things, caught a few notes of a song, she would conclude: �They�re having company down below; gay doings, I�ll be bound;� whereupon, in her symmetrical face, beneath the arch of her now snow-white hair, a smile from her young days, sprightly but proper, would for a moment set each of her features in its place, arranging them in an intricate and special order, as though for a country-dance.  ���But the moment in the life of the Guermantes which excited the keenest interest in Fran�oise, gave her the most complete satisfaction and at the same time the sharpest annoyance was that at which, the two halves of the great gate having been thrust apart, the Duchess stepped into her carriage. It was generally a little while after our servants had finished the celebration of that sort of solemn passover which none might disturb, called their midday dinner, during which they were so far taboo that my father himself was not allowed to ring for them, knowing moreover that none of them would have paid any more attention to the fifth peal than to the first, and that the discourtesy would therefore have been a pure waste of time and trouble, though not without trouble in store for himself. For Fran�oise (who, in her old age, lost no opportunity of standing upon her dignity) would without fail have presented him, for the rest of the day, with a face covered with the tiny red cuneiform hieroglyphs by which she made visible � though by no means legible � to the outer world the long tale of her griefs and the profound reasons for her dissatisfactions. She would enlarge upon them, too, in a running �aside,� but not so that we could catch her words. She called this practice � which, she imagined, must be infuriating, �mortifying� as she herself put it,�vexing� to us ��saying low masses all the blessed day.�  ���The last rites accomplished, Fran�oise, who was at one and the same time, as in the primitive church, the celebrant and one of the faithful, helped herself to a final glass, undid the napkin from her throat, folded it after wiping from her lips a stain of watered wine and coffee, slipped it into its ring, turned a doleful eye to thank �her� young footman who, to shew his zeal in her service, was saying: �Come, ma�am, a drop more of the grape; it�s d�licious to-day,� and went straight across to the window, which she flung open, protesting that it was too hot to breathe in �this wretched kitchen.� Dexterously casting, as she turned the latch and let in the fresh air, a glance of studied indifference into the courtyard below, she furtively elicited the conclusion that the Duchess was not ready yet to start, brooded for a moment with contemptuous, impassioned eyes over the waiting carriage, and, this meed of attention once paid to the things of the earth, raised them towards the heavens, whose purity she had already divined from the sweetness of the air and the warmth of the sun; and let them rest on a corner of the roof, at the place where, every spring, there came and built, immediately over the chimney of my bedroom, a pair of pigeons like those she used to hear cooing from her kitchen at Combray.  ��� �Ah! Combray, Combray!� she cried. And the almost singing tone in which she declaimed this invocation might, taken with the Arlesian purity of her features, have made the onlooker suspect her of a Southern origin and that the lost land which she was lamenting was no more, really, than a land of adoption. If so, he would have been wrong, for it seems that there is no province that has not its own South-country; do we not indeed constantly meet Savoyards and Bretons in whose speech we find all those pleasing transpositions of longs and shorts that are characteristic of the Southerner? �Ah, Combray, when shall I look on thee again, poor land! When shall I pass the blessed day among thy hawthorns, under our own poor lily-oaks, hearing the grasshoppers sing, and the Vivonne making a little noise like someone whispering, instead of that wretched bell from our young master, who can never stay still for half an hour on end without having me run the length of that wicked corridor. And even then he makes out I don�t come quick enough; you�d need to hear the bell ring before he has pulled it, and if you�re a minute late, away he flies into the most towering rage. Alas, poor Combray; maybe I shall see thee only in death, when they drop me like a stone into the hollow of the tomb. And so, nevermore shall I smell thy lovely hawthorns, so white and all. But in the sleep of death I dare say I shall still hear those three peals of the bell which will have driven me to damnation in this world.�  ���Her soliloquy was interrupted by the voice of the waistcoat-maker downstairs, the same who had so delighted my grandmother once, long ago, when she had gone to pay a call on Mme. de Villeparisis, and now occupied no less exalted a place in Franchise�s affections. Having raised his head when he heard our window open, he had already been trying for some time to attract his neighbour�s attention, in order to bid her good day. The coquetry of the young girl that Fran�oise had once been softened and refined for M. Jupien the querulous face of our old cook, dulled by age, ill-temper and the heat of the kitchen fire, and it was with a charming blend of reserve, familiarity and modesty that she bestowed a gracious salutation on the waistcoat-maker, but without making any audible response, for if she did infringe Mamma�s orders by looking into the courtyard, she would never have dared to go the length of talking from the window, which would have been quite enough (according to her) to bring down on her �a whole chapter� from the Mistress. She pointed to the waiting carriage, as who should say: �A fine pair, eh!� though what she actually muttered was: �What an old rattle-trap!� but principally because she knew that he would be bound to answer, putting his hand to his lips so as to be audible without having to shout:  ��� �You could have one too if you liked, as good as they have and better, I dare say, only you don�t care for that sort of thing.� ���And Franoise, after a modest, evasive signal of delight, the meaning of which was, more or less: �Tastes differ, you know; simplicity�s the rule in this house,� shut the window again in case Mamma should come in. These �you� who might have had more horses than the Guermantes were ourselves, but Jupien was right in saying �you� since, except for a few purely personal gratifications, such as, when she coughed all day long without ceasing and everyone in the house was afraid of catching her cold, that of pretending, with an irritating little titter, that she had not got a cold, like those plants that an animal to which they are wholly attached keeps alive with food which it catches, eats and digests for them and of which it offers them the ultimate and easily assimilable residue, Fran�oise lived with us in full community; it was we who, with our virtues, our wealth, our style of living, must take on ourselves the task of concocting those little sops to her vanity out of which was formed � with the addition of the recognised rights of freely practising the cult of the midday dinner according to the traditional custom, which included a mouthful of air at the window when the meal was finished, a certain amount of loitering in the street when she went out to do her marketing, and a holiday on Sundays when she paid a visit to her niece � the portion of happiness indispensable to her existence. And so it can be understood that Fran�oise might well have succumbed in those first days of our migration, a victim, in a house where my father�s claims to distinction were not yet known, to a malady which she herself called �wearying,� wearying in the active sense in which the word ennui is employed by Corneille, or in the last letters of soldiers who end by taking their own lives because they are wearying for their girls or for their native villages. Fran�oise�s wearying had soon been cured by none other than Jupien, for he at once procured her a pleasure no less keen, indeed more refined than she would have felt if we had decided to keep a carriage. �Very good class, those Juliens,� (for Fran�oise readily assimilated new names to those with which she was already familiar) �very worthy people; you can see it written on their faces.� Jupien was in fact able to understand, and to inform the world that if we did not keep a carriage it was because we had no wish for one. This new friend of Fran�oise was very little at home, having obtained a post in one of the Government offices. A waistcoat-maker first of all, with the �chit of a girl� whom my grandmother had taken for his daughter, he had lost all interest in the exercise of that calling after his assistant (who, when still little more than a child, had shewn great skill in darning a torn skirt, that day when my grandmother had gone to call on Mme. de Villeparisis) had turned to ladies� fashions and become a seamstress. A prentice hand, to begin with, in a dressmaker�s workroom, set to stitch a seam, to fasten a flounce, to sew on a button or to press a crease, to fix a waistband with hooks and eyes, she had quickly risen to be second and then chief assistant, and having formed a connexion of her own among ladies of fashion now worked at home, that is to say in our courtyard, generally with one or two of her young friends from the workroom, whom she had taken on as apprentices. After this, Jupien�s presence in the place had ceased to matter. No doubt the little girl (a big girl by this time) had often to cut out waistcoats still. But with her friends to assist her she needed no one besides. And so Jupien, her uncle, had sought employment outside. He was free at first to return home at midday, then, when he had definitely succeeded the man whose substitute only he had begun by being, not before dinner-time. His appointment to the �regular establishment� was, fortunately, not announced until some weeks after our arrival, so that his courtesy could be brought to bear on her long enough to help Fran�oise to pass through the first, most difficult phase without undue suffering. At the same time, and without underrating his value to Fran�oise as, so to speak, a sedative during the period of transition, I am bound to say that my first impression of Jupien had been far from favourable. At a little distance, entirely ruining the effect that his plump cheeks and vivid colouring would otherwise have produced, his eyes, brimming with a compassionate, mournful, dreamy gaze, led one to suppose that he was seriously ill or had just suffered a great bereavement. Not only was he nothing of the sort, but as soon as he opened his mouth (and his speech, by the way, was perfect) he was quite markedly cynical and cold. There resulted from this discord between eyes and lips a certain falsity which was not attractive, and by which he had himself the air of being made as uncomfortable as a guest who arrives in morning dress at a party where everyone else is in evening dress, or as a commoner who having to speak to a Royal Personage does not know exactly how he ought to address him and gets round the difficulty by cutting down his remarks to almost nothing. Jupien�s (here the comparison ends) were, on the contrary, charming. Indeed, corresponding possibly to this overflowing of his face by his eyes (which one ceased to notice when one came to know him), I soon discerned in him a rare intellect, and one of the most spontaneously literary that it has been my privilege to come across, in the sense that, probably without education, he possessed or had assimilated, with the help only of a few books skimmed in early life, the most ingenious turns of speech. The most gifted people that I had known had died young. And so I was convinced that Jupien�s life would soon be cut short. Kindness was among his qualities, and pity, the most delicate and the most generous feelings for others. But his part in the life of Fran�oise had soon ceased to be indispensable. She had learned to put up with understudies.  ���Indeed, when a tradesman or servant came to our door with a parcel or message, while seeming to pay no attention and merely pointing vaguely to an empty chair, Fran�oise so skilfully put to the best advantage the few seconds that he spent in the kitchen, while he waited for Mamma�s answer, that it was very seldom that the stranger went away without having ineradicably engraved upon his memory the conviction that, if we �did not have� any particular thing, it was because we had �no wish� for it. If she made such a point of other people�s knowing that we �had money� (for she knew nothing of what Saint-Loup used to call partitive articles, and said simply �have money,� �fetch water�), of their realising that we were rich, it was not because riches with nothing else besides, riches without virtue, were in her eyes the supreme good in life; but virtue without riches was not her ideal either. Riches were for her, so to speak, a necessary condition of virtue, failing which virtue itself would lack both merit and charm. She distinguished so little between them that she had come in time to invest each with the other�s attributes, to expect some material comfort from virtue, to discover something edifying in riches.  ���As soon as she had shut the window again, which she did quickly � otherwise Mamma would, it appeared, have heaped on her �every conceivable insult�� Fran�oise began with many groans and sighs to put straight the kitchen table.  ��� �There are some Guermantes who stay in the Rue de la Chaise,� began my father�s valet; �I had a friend who used to be with them; he was their second coachman. And I know a fellow, not my old pal, but his brother-in-law, who did his time in the Army with one of the Baron de Guermantes�s stud grooms. Does your mother know you�re out?� added the valet, who was in the habit, just as he used to hum the popular airs of the season, of peppering his conversation with all the latest witticisms.  ���Fran�oise, with the tired eyes of an ageing woman, eyes which moreover saw everything from Combray, in a hazy distance, made out not the witticism that underlay the words, but that there must be something witty in them since they bore no relation to the rest of his speech and had been uttered with considerable emphasis by one whom she knew to be a joker. She smiled at him, therefore, with an air of benevolent bewilderment, as who should say: �Always the same, that Victor!� And she was genuinely pleased, knowing that listening to smart sayings of this sort was akin � if remotely � to those reputable social pleasures for which, in every class of society, people make haste to dress themselves in their best and run the risk of catching cold. Furthermore, she believed the valet to be a friend after her own heart, for he never left off denouncing, with fierce indignation, the appalling measures which the Republic was about to enforce against the clergy. Fran�oise had not yet learned that our cruellest adversaries are not those who contradict and try to convince us, but those who magnify or invent reports which may make us unhappy, taking care not to include any appearance of justification, which might lessen our discomfort, and perhaps give us some slight regard for a party which they make a point of displaying to us, to complete our torment, as being at once terrible and triumphant.  ���The Duchess must be connected with all that lot,� said Fran�oise, bringing the conversation back to the Guermantes of the Rue de la Chaise, as one plays a piece over again from the andante. �I can�t recall who it was told me that one of them had married a cousin of the Duke. It�s the same kindred, anyway. Ay, they�re a great family, the Guermantes!� she added, in a tone of respect founding the greatness of the family at once on the number of its branches and the brilliance of its connexions, as Pascal founds the truth of Religion on Reason and on the Authority of the Scriptures. For since there was but the single word �great� to express both meanings, it seemed to her that they formed a single idea, her vocabulary, like cut stones sometimes, shewing thus on certain of its facets a flaw which projected a ray of darkness into the recesses of her mind. �I wonder now if it wouldn�t be them that have their castle at Guermantes, not a score of miles from Combray; then they must be kin to their cousin at Algiers, too.� My mother and I long asked ourselves who this cousin at Algiers could be until finally we discovered that Fran�oise meant by the name �Algiers� the town of Angers. What is far off may be more familiar to us than what is quite near. Fran�oise, who knew the name �Algiers� from some particularly unpleasant dates that used to be given us at the New Year, had never heard of Angers. Her language, like the French language itself, and especially that of place-names, was thickly strewn with errors. �I meant to talk to their butler about it. What is it again you call him?� she interrupted herself as though putting a formal question as to the correct procedure, which she went on to answer with: �Oh, of course, it�s Antoine you call him!� as though Antoine had been a title. �He�s the one who could tell me, but he�s quite the gentleman, he is, a great scholar, you�d say they�d cut his tongue out, or that he�d forgotten to learn to speak. He makes no response when you talk to him,� went on Fran�oise, who used �make response� in the same sense as Mme. de S�vign�. �But,� she added, quite untruthfully, �so long as I know what�s boiling in my pot, I don�t bother my head about what�s in other people�s. Whatever he is, he�s not a Catholic. Besides, he�s not a courageous man.� (This criticism might have led one to suppose that Fran�oise had changed her mind about physical bravery which, according to her, in Combray days, lowered men to the level of wild beasts. But it was not so. �Courageous� meant simply a hard worker.) �They do say, too, that he�s thievish as a magpie, but it doesn�t do to believe all one hears. The servants never stay long there because of the lodge; the porters are jealous and set the Duchess against them. But it�s safe to say that he�s a real twister, that Antoine, and his Antoinesse is no better,� concluded Fran�oise, who, in furnishing the name �Antoine� with a feminine ending that would designate the butler�s wife, was inspired, no doubt, in her act of word-formation by an unconscious memory of the words chanoine and chanoinesse. If so, she was not far wrong. There is still a street near Notre-Dame called Rue Chanoinesse, a name which must have been given to it (since it was never inhabited by any but male Canons) by those Frenchmen of olden days of whom Fran�oise was, properly speaking, the contemporary. She proceeded, moreover, at once to furnish another example of this way of forming feminine endings, for she went on: �But one thing sure and certain is that it�s the Duchess that has Guermantes Castle. And it�s she that is the Lady Mayoress down in those parts. That�s always something.�  ��� �I can well believe that it is something,� came with conviction from the footman, who had not detected the irony.  ��� �You think so, do you, my boy, you think it�s something? Why, for folk like them to be Mayor and Mayoress, it�s just thank you for nothing. Ah, if it was mine, that Guermantes Castle, you wouldn�t see me setting foot in Paris, I can tell you. I�m sure a family who�ve got something to go on with, like Monsieur and Madame here, must have queer ideas to stay on in this wretched town rather than get away down to Combray the moment they�re free to start, and no one hindering them. Why do they put off retiring? They�ve got everything they want. Why wait till they�re dead? Ah, if I had only a crust of dry bread to eat and a faggot to keep me warm in winter, a fine time I�d have of it at home in my brother�s poor old house at Combray. Down there you do feel you�re alive; you haven�t all these houses stuck up in front of you, there is so little noise at night-time, you can hear the frogs singing five miles off and more.�  ��� �That must indeed be fine!� exclaimed the young footman with enthusiasm, as though this last attraction had been as peculiar to Combray as the gondola is to Venice. A more recent arrival in the household than my father�s valet, he used to talk to Fran�oise about things which might interest not himself so much as her. And Fran�oise, whose face wrinkled up in disgust when she was treated as a mere cook, had for the young footman, who referred to her always as the �housekeeper,� that peculiar tenderness which Princes not of the blood royal feel towards the well-meaning young men who dignify them with a �Highness.�  ��� �At any rate one knows what one�s about, there, and what time of year it is. It isn�t like here where you won�t find one wretched buttercup flowering at holy Easter any more than you would at Christmas, and I can�t hear so much as the tiniest ang�lus ring when I lift my old bones out of bed in the morning. Down there, you can hear every hour; there�s only the one poor bell, but you say to yourself: �My brother will be coming in from the field now,� and you watch the daylight fade, and the bell rings to bless the fruits of the earth, and you have time to take a turn before you light the lamp. But here it�s daytime and it�s nighttime, and you go to bed, and you can�t say any more than the dumb beasts what you�ve been about all day.�  ��� �I gather M�s�glise is a fine place, too, Madame,� broke in the young footman, who found that the conversation was becoming a little too abstract for his liking, and happened to remember having heard us, at table, mention M�s�glise.  ��� �Oh! M�s�glise, is it?� said Fran�oise with the broad smile which one could always bring to her lips by uttering any of those names � M�s�glise, Combray, Tansonville. They were so intimate a part of her life that she felt, on meeting them outside it, on hearing them used in conversation, a hilarity more or less akin to that which a professor excites in his class by making an allusion to some contemporary personage whose name the students had never supposed could possibly greet their ears from the height of the academic chair. Her pleasure arose also from the feeling that these places were something to her which they were not for the rest of the world, old companions with whom one has shared many delights; and she smiled at them as if she found in them something witty, because she did find there a great part of herself.  ��� �Yes, you may well say so, son, it is a pretty enough place is M�s�glise;� she went on with a tinkling laugh, �but how did you ever come to hear tell of M�s�glise?� ��� �How did I hear of M�s�glise? But it�s a well-known place; people have told me about it � yes, over and over again,� he assured her with that criminal inexactitude of the informer who, whenever we attempt to form an impartial estimate of the importance that a thing which matters to us may have for other people, makes it impossible for us to succeed.  ��� �I can tell you, it�s better down there, under the cherry trees, than standing before the fire all day.�  ���She spoke to them even of Eulalie as a good person. For since Eulalie�s death Fran�oise had completely forgotten that she had loved her as little in her lifetime as she loved every one whose cupboard was bare, who was dying of hunger, and after that came, like a good for nothing, thanks to the bounty of the rich, to �put on airs.� It no longer pained her that Eulalie had so skilfully managed, Sunday after Sunday, to secure her �trifle� from my aunt. As for the latter, Fran�oise never left off singing her praises.  ��� �But it was at Combray, surely, that you used to be, with a cousin of Madame?� asked the young footman.  ��� �Yes, with Mme. Octave � oh, a dear, good, holy woman, my poor friends, and a house where there was always enough and to spare, and all of the very best, a good woman, you may well say, who had no pity on the partridges, or the pheasants, or anything; you might turn up five to dinner or six, it was never the meat that was lacking, and of the first quality too, and white wine, and red wine, and everything you could wish.� (Fran�oise used the word �pity� in the sense given it by Labruy�re.) �It was she that paid the damages, always, even if the family stayed for months and years.� (This reflection was not really a slur upon us, for Fran�oise belonged to an epoch when the words �damages� was not restricted to a legal use and meant simply expense.) �Ah, I can tell you, people didn�t go empty away from that house. As his reverence the Cur� has told us, many�s the time, if there ever was a woman who could count on going straight before the Throne of God, it was she. Poor Madame, I can hear her saying now, in the little voice she had: �You know, Fran�oise, I can eat nothing myself, but I want it all to be just as nice for the others as if I could.� They weren�t for her, the victuals, you may be quite sure. If you�d only seen her, she weighed no more than a bag of cherries; there wasn�t that much of her. She would never listen to a word I said, she would never send for the doctor. Ah, it wasn�t in that house that you�d have to gobble down your dinner. She liked her servants to be fed properly. Here, it�s been just the same again to-day; we haven�t had time for so much as to break a crust of bread; everything goes like ducks and drakes.�  ���What annoyed her more than anything were the rusks of pulled bread that my father used to eat. She was convinced that he had them simply to give himself airs and to keep her �dancing.� �I can tell you frankly,� the young footman assured her, �that I never saw the like.� He said it as if he had seen everything, and as if in him the range of a millennial experience extended over all countries and their customs, among which was not anywhere to be found a custom of eating pulled bread. �Yes, yes,� the butler muttered, �but that will all be changed; the men are going on strike in Canada, and the Minister told Monsieur the other evening that he�s clearing two hundred thousand francs out of it.� There was no note of censure in his tone, not that he was not himself entirely honest, but since he regarded all politicians as unsound the crime of peculation seemed to him less serious than the pettiest larceny. He did not even stop to ask himself whether he had heard this historic utterance aright, and was not struck by the improbability that such a thing would have been admitted by the guilty party himself to my father without my father�s immediately turning him out of the house. But the philosophy of Combray made it impossible for Fran�oise to expect that the strikes in Canada could have any repercussion on the use of pulled bread. �So long as the world goes round, look, there�ll be masters to keep us on the trot, and servants to do their bidding.� In disproof of this theory of perpetual motion, for the last quarter of an hour my mother (who probably did not employ the same measures of time as Fran�oise in reckoning the duration of the latter�s dinner) had been saying:  ��� �What on earth can they be doing? They�ve been at least two hours at their dinner.�  ���And she rang timidly three or four times. Fran�oise, �her� footman, the butler, heard the bell ring, not as a summons to themselves, and with no thought of answering it, but rather like the first sounds of the instruments being tuned when the next part of a concert is just going to begin, and one knows that there will be only a few minutes more of interval. And so, when the peals were repeated and became more urgent, our servants began to pay attention, and, judging that they had not much time left and that the resumption of work was at hand, at a peal somewhat louder than the rest gave a collective sigh and went their several ways, the footman slipping downstairs to smoke a cigarette outside the door, Fran�oise, after a string of reflexions on ourselves, such as: �They�ve got the jumps to-day, surely,� going up to put her things tidy in her attic, while the butler, having supplied himself first with note-paper from my bedroom, polished off the arrears of his private correspondence.  ���Despite the apparent stiffness of their butler, Fran�oise had been in a position, from the first, to inform me that the Guermantes occupied their mansion by virtue not of an immemorial right but of a quite recent tenancy, and that the garden over which it looked on the side that I did not know was quite small and just like all the gardens along the street; and I realised at length that there were not to be seen there pit and gallows or fortified mill, secret chamber, pillared dovecot, manorial bakehouse or tithe-barn, dungeon or drawbridge, or fixed bridge either for that matter, any more than toll-houses or pinnacles, charters, muniments, ramparts or commemorative mounds. But just as Elstir, when the bay of Balbec, losing its mystery, had become for me simply a portion, interchangeable with any other, of the total quantity of salt water distributed over the earth�s surface, had suddenly restored to it a personality of its own by telling me that it was the gulf of opal, painted by Whistler in his �Harmonies in Blue and Silver,� so the name Guermantes had seen perish under the strokes of Fran�oise�s hammer the last of the dwellings that had issued from its syllables when one day an old friend of my father said to us, speaking of the Duchess: �She is the first lady in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; hers is the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.� No doubt the most exclusive drawing-room, the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain was little or nothing after all those other mansions of which in turn I had dreamed. And yet in this one too (and it was to be the last of the series), there was something, however humble, quite apart from its material components, a secret differentiation.  ���And it became all the more essential that I should be able to explore in the drawing-room of Mme. de Guermantes, among her friends, the mystery of her name, since I did not find it in her person when I saw her leave the house in the morning on foot, or in the afternoon in her carriage. Once before, indeed, in the church at Combray, she had appeared to me in the blinding flash of a transfiguration, with cheeks irreducible to, impenetrable by, the colour of the name Guermantes and of afternoons on the banks of the Vivonne, taking the place of my shattered dream like a swan or willow into which has been changed a god or nymph, and which henceforward, subjected to natural laws, will glide over the water or be shaken by the wind. And yet, when that radiance had vanished, hardly had I lost sight of it before it formed itself again, like the green and rosy afterglow of sunset after the sweep of the oar has broken it, and in the solitude of my thoughts the name had quickly appropriated to itself my impression of the face. But now, frequently, I saw her at her window, in the courtyard, in the street, and for myself at least if I did not succeed in integrating in her the name Guermantes, I cast the blame on the impotence of my mind to accomplish the whole act that I demanded of it; but she, our neighbour, she seemed to make the same error, nay more to make it without discomfiture, without any of my scruples, without even suspecting that it was an error. Thus Mme. de Guermantes shewed in her dresses the same anxiety to follow the fashions as if, believing herself to have become simply a woman like all the rest, she had aspired to that elegance in her attire in which other ordinary women might equal and perhaps surpass her; I had seen her in the street gaze admiringly at a well-dressed actress; and in the morning, before she sallied forth on foot, as if the opinion of the passers-by, whose vulgarity she accentuated by parading familiarly through their midst her inaccessible life, could be a tribunal competent to judge her, I would see her before the glass playing, with a conviction free from all pretence or irony, with passion, with ill-humour, with conceit, like a queen who has consented to appear as a servant-girl in theatricals at court, this part, so unworthy of her, of a fashionable woman; and in this mythological oblivion of her natural grandeur, she looked to see whether her veil was hanging properly, smoothed her cuffs, straightened her cloak, as the celestial swan performs all the movements natural to his animal species, keeps his eyes painted on either side of his beak without putting into them any glint of life, and darts suddenly after a bud or an umbrella, as a swan would, without remembering that he is a god. But as the traveller, disappointed by the first appearance of a strange town, reminds himself that he will doubtless succeed in penetrating its charm if he visits its museums and galleries, so I assured myself that, had I been given the right of entry into Mme. de Guermantes�s house, were I one of her friends, were I to penetrate into her life, I should then know what, within its glowing orange-tawny envelope, her name did really, objectively enclose for other people, since, after all, my father�s friend had said that the Guermantes set was something quite by itself in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.  ���The life which I supposed them to lead there flowed from a source so different from anything in my experience, and must, I felt, be so indissolubly associated with that particular house that I could not have imagined the presence, at the Duchess�s parties, of people in whose company I myself had already been, of people who really existed. For not being able suddenly to change their nature, they would have carried on conversations there of the sort that I knew; their partners would perhaps have stooped to reply to them in the same human speech; and, in the course of an evening spent in the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, there would have been moments identical with moments that I had already lived. Which was impossible. It was thus that my mind was embarrassed by certain difficulties, and the Presence of Our Lord�s Body in the Host seemed to me no more obscure a mystery than this leading house in the Faubourg, situated here, on the right bank of the river, and so near that from my bed, in the morning, I could hear its carpets being beaten. But the line of demarcation that separated me from the Faubourg Saint-Germain seemed to me all the more real because it was purely ideal. I felt clearly that it was already part of the Faubourg, when I saw the Guermantes doormat, spread out beyond that intangible Equator, of which my mother had made bold to say, having like myself caught a glimpse of it one day when their door stood open, that it was a shocking state. For the rest, how could their dining-room, their dim gallery upholstered in red plush, into which I could see sometimes from our kitchen window, have failed to possess in my eyes the mysterious charm of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, to form part of it in an essential fashion, to be geographically situated within it, since to have been entertained to dinner in that room was to have gone into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, to have breathed its atmosphere, since the people who, before going to table, sat down by the side of Mme. de Guermantes on the leather-covered sofa in that gallery were all of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. No doubt elsewhere than in the Faubourg, at certain parties, one might see now and then, majestically enthroned amid the vulgar herd of fashion, one of those men who were mere names and varyingly assumed, when one tried to form a picture of them, the aspect of a tournament or of a royal forest. But here, in the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-German, in the drawing-room, in the dim gallery, there were only they. They were wrought of precious materials, the columns that upheld the temple. Indeed for quiet family parties it was from among them only that Mme. de Guermantes might select her guests, and in the dinners for twelve, gathered around the dazzling napery and plate, they were like the golden statues of the Apostles in the Sainte-Chapelle, symbolic, consecrative pillars before the Holy Table. As for the tiny strip of garden that stretched between high walls at the back of the house, where on summer evenings Mme. de Guermantes had liqueurs and orangeade brought out after dinner, how could I not have felt that to sit there of an evening, between nine and eleven, on its iron chairs � endowed with a magic as potent as the leathern sofa � without inhaling the breezes peculiar to the Faubourg Saint-Germain was as impossible as to take a siesta in the oasis of Figuig without thereby being necessarily in Africa. Only imagination and belief can differentiate from the rest certain objects, certain people, and can create an atmosphere. Alas, those picturesque sites, those natural accidents, those local curiosities, those works of art of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, never probably should I be permitted to set my feet among them. And I must content myself with a shiver of excitement as I sighted, from the deep sea (and without the least hope of ever landing there) like an outstanding minaret, like the first palm, like the first signs of some exotic industry or vegetation, the well-trodden doormat of its shore.  ���But if the H�tel de Guermantes began for me at its hall-door, its dependencies must be regarded as extending a long way farther, according to the Duke, who, looking on all the other tenants as farmers, peasants, purchasers of forfeited estates, whose opinion was of no account, shaved himself every morning in his nightshirt at the window, came down into the courtyard, according to the warmth or coldness of the day, in his shirtsleeves, in pyjamas, in a plaid coat of startling colours, with a shaggy nap, in little light-coloured coats shorter than the jackets beneath, and made one of his grooms lead past him at a trot some horse that he had just been buying. More than once, indeed, the horse broke the window of Jupien�s shop, whereupon Jupien, to the Duke�s indignation, demanded compensation. �If it were only in consideration of all the good that Madame la Duchesse does in the house, here, and in the parish,� said M. de Guermantes, �it is an outrage on this fellow�s part to claim a penny from us.� But Jupien had stuck to his point, apparently not having the faintest idea what �good� the Duchess had ever done. And yet she did do good, but � since one cannot do good to everybody at once � the memory of the benefits that we have heaped on one person is a valid reason for our abstaining from helping another, whose discontent we thereby make all the stronger. From other points of view than that of charity the quarter appeared to the Duke � and this over a considerable area � to be only an extension of his courtyard, a longer track for his horses. After seeing how a new acquisition trotted by itself he would have it harnessed and taken through all the neighbouring streets, the groom running beside the carriage holding the reins, making it pass to and fro before the Duke who stood on the pavement, erect, gigantic, enormous in his vivid clothes, a cigar between his teeth, his head in the air, his eyeglass scrutinous, until the moment when he sprang on the box, drove the horse up and down for a little to try it, then set off with his new turn-out to pick up his mistress in the Champs-Elys�es. M. de Guermantes bade good day, before leaving the courtyard, to two couples who belonged more or less to his world; the first, some cousins of his who, like working-class parents, were never at home to look after their children, since every morning the wife went off to the Schola to study counterpoint and fugue, and the husband to his studio to carve wood and beat leather; and after them the Baron and Baronne de Norpois, always dressed in black, she like a pew-opener and he like a mute at a funeral, who emerged several times daily on their way to church. They were the nephew and niece of the old Ambassador who was our friend, and whom my father had, in fact, met at the foot of the staircase without realising from where he came; for my father supposed that so important a personage, one who had come in contact with the most eminent men in Europe and was probably quite indifferent to the empty distinctions of rank, was hardly likely to frequent the society of these obscure, clerical and narrow-minded nobles. They had not been long in the place; Jupien, who had come out into the courtyard to say a word to the husband just as he was greeting M. de Guermantes, called him �M. Norpois,� not being certain of his name.  ��� �Monsieur Norpois, indeed! Oh, that really is good! Just wait a little! This individual will be calling you Comrade Norpois next!� exclaimed M. de Guermantes, turning to the Baron. He was at last able to vent his spleen against Jupien who addressed him as �Monsieur,� instead of �Monsieur le Duc.� ���One day when M. de Guermantes required some information upon a matter of which my father had professional knowledge, he had introduced himself to him with great courtesy. After that, he had often some neighbourly service to ask of my father and, as soon as he saw him begin to come downstairs, his mind occupied with his work and anxious to avoid any interruption, the Duke, leaving his stable-boys, would come up to him in the courtyard, straighten the collar of his great-coat, with the serviceable deftness inherited from a line of royal body-servants in days gone by, take him by the hand, and, holding it in his own, patting it even to prove to my father, with a courtesan�s or courtier�s shamelessness, that he, the Duc de Guermantes, made no bargain about my father�s right to the privilege of contact with the ducal flesh, lead him, so to speak, on leash, extremely annoyed and thinking only how he might escape, through the carriage entrance out into the street. He had given us a sweeping bow one day when we had come in just as he was going out in the carriage with his wife; he was bound to have told her my name; but what likelihood was there of her remembering it, or my face either? And besides, what a feeble recommendation to be pointed out simply as being one of her tenants! Another, more valuable, would have been my meeting the Duchess in the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, who, as it happened, had just sent word by my grandmother that I was to go and see her, and, remembering that I had been intending to go in for literature, had added that I should meet several authors there. But my father felt that I was still a little young to go into society, and as the state of my health continued to give him uneasiness he did not see the use of establishing precedents that would do me no good.  ���As one of Mme. de Guermantes�s footmen was in the habit of talking to Fran�oise, I picked up the names of several of the houses which she frequented, but formed no impression of any of them; from the moment in which they were a part of her life, of that life which I saw only through the veil of her name, were they not inconceivable?  ��� �To-night there�s a big party with a Chinese shadow show at the Princesse de Parme�s,� said the footman, �but we shan�t be going, because at five o�clock Madame is taking the train to Chantilly, to spend a few days with the Due d�Aumale; but it�ll be the lady�s maid and valet that are going with her. I�m to stay here. She won�t be at all pleased, the Princesse de Parme won�t, that�s four times already she�s written to Madame la Duchesse.�  ��� �Then you won�t be going down to Guermantes Castle this year?�  ��� �It�s the first time we shan�t be going there: it�s because of the Duke�s rheumatics, the doctor says he�s not to go there till the hot pipes are in, but we�ve been there every year till now, right on to January. If the hot pipes aren�t ready, perhaps Madame will go for a few days to Cannes, to the Duchesse de Guise, but nothing�s settled yet.�  ��� �And to the theatre, do you go, sometimes?�  ��� �We go now and then to the Op�ra, usually on the evenings when the Princesse de Parme has her box, that�s once a week; it seems it�s a fine show they give there, plays, operas, everything. Madame refused to subscribe to it herself, but we go all the same to the boxes Madame�s friends take, one one night, another another, often with the Princesse de Guermantes, the Duke�s cousin�s lady. She�s sister to the Duke of Bavaria. And so you�ve got to run upstairs again now, have you?� went on the footman, who, albeit identified with the Guermantes, looked upon masters in general as a political estate, a view which allowed him to treat Fran�oise with as much respect as if she too were in service with a duchess. �You enjoy good health, ma�am.�  ��� �Oh, if it wasn�t for these cursed legs of mine! On the plain I can still get along� (�on the plain� meant in the courtyard or in the streets, where Fran�oise had no objection to walking, in other words �on a plane surface�) �but it�s these stairs that do me in, devil take them. Good day to you, sir, see you again, perhaps, this evening.�  ���She was all the more anxious to continue her conversations with the footman after he mentioned to her that the sons of dukes often bore a princely title which they retained until their fathers were dead. Evidently the cult of the nobility, blended with and accommodating itself to a certain spirit of revolt against it, must, springing hereditarily from the soil of France, be very strongly implanted still in her people. For Fran�oise, to whom you might speak of the genius of Napoleon or of wireless telegraphy without succeeding in attracting her attention, and without her slackening for an instant the movements with which she was scraping the ashes from the grate or laying the table, if she were simply to be told these idiosyncrasies of nomenclature, and that the younger son of the Duc de Guermantes was generally called Prince d�Ol�ron, would at once exclaim: �That�s fine, that is!� and stand there dazed, as though in contemplation of a stained window in church.  ���Fran�oise learned also from the Prince d�Agrigente�s valet, who had become friends with her by coming often to the house with notes for the Duchess, that he had been hearing a great deal of talk in society about the marriage of the Marquis de Saint-Loup to Mlle. d�Ambresac, and that it was practically settled.  ���That villa, that opera-box, into which Mme. de Guermantes transfused the current of her life, must, it seemed to me, be places no less fairylike than her home. The names of Guise, of Parme, of Guermantes-Baviere, differentiated from all possible others the holiday places to which the Duchess resorted, the daily festivities which the track of her bowling wheels bound, as with ribbons, to her mansion. If they told me that in those holidays, in those festivities, consisted serially the life of Mme. de Guermantes, they brought no further light to bear on it. Each of them gave to the life of the Duchess a different determination, but succeeded only in changing the mystery of it, without allowing to escape any of its own mystery which simply floated, protected by a covering, enclosed in a bell, through the tide of the life of all the world. The Duchess might take her luncheon on the shore of the Mediterranean at Carnival time, but, in the villa of Mme. de Guise, where the queen of Parisian society was nothing more, in her white linen dress, among numberless princesses, than a guest like any of the rest, and on that account more moving still to me, more herself by being thus made new, like a star of the ballet who in the fantastic course of a figure takes the place of each of her humbler sisters in succession; she might look at Chinese shadow shows, but at a party given by the Princesse de Parme, listen to tragedy or opera, but from the box of the Princesse de Guermantes.  ���As we localise in the body of a person all the potentialities of that person�s life, our recollections of the people he knows and has just left or is on his way to meet, if, having learned from Fran�oise that Mme. de Guermantes was going on foot to luncheon with the Princesse de Parme, I saw her, about midday, emerge from her house in a gown of flesh-coloured satin over which her face was of the same shade, like a cloud that rises above the setting sun, it was all the pleasures of the Faubourg Saint-Germain that I saw before me, contained in that small compass, as in a shell, between its twin valves that glowed with roseate nacre.  ���My father had a friend at the Ministry, one A. J. Moreau, who, to distinguish him from the other Moreaus, took care always to prefix both initials to his name, with the result that people called him, for short, �A.J.� Well, somehow or other, this A. J. found himself entitled to a stall at the Op�ra-Comique on a gala night, he sent the ticket to my father, and as Berma, whom I had not been again to see since my first disappointment, was to give an act of Ph�dre, my grandmother persuaded my father to pass it on to me.  ���To tell the truth, I attached no importance to this possibility of hearing Berma which, a few years earlier, had plunged me in such a state of agitation. And it was not without a sense of melancholy that I realized the fact of my indifference to what at one time I had put before health, comfort, everything. It was not that there had been any slackening of my desire for an opportunity to contemplate close at hand the precious particles of reality of which my imagination caught a broken glimpse. But my imagination no longer placed these in the diction of a great actress; since my visits to Elstir, it was on certain tapestries, certain modern paintings that I had brought to bear the inner faith I had once had in this acting, in this tragic art of Berma; my faith, my desire, no longer coming forward to pay incessant worship to the diction, the attitudes of Berma, the counterpart that I possessed of them in my heart had gradually perished, like those other counterparts of the dead in ancient Egypt which had to be fed continually in order to maintain their originals in eternal life. This art had become a feeble, tawdry thing. No deep-lying soul inhabited it any more.  ���That evening, as, armed with the ticket my father had received from his friend, I was climbing the grand staircase of the Opera, I saw in front of me a man whom I took at first for M. de Charlus, whose bearing he had; when he turned his head to ask some question of one of the staff I saw that I had been mistaken, but I had no hesitation in placing the stranger in the same class of society, from the way not only in which he was dressed but in which he spoke to the man who took the tickets and to the box-openers who were keeping him waiting. For, apart from personal details of similarity, there was still at this period between any smart and wealthy man of that section of the nobility and any smart and wealthy man of the world of finance or �big business� a strongly marked difference. Where one of the latter would have thought he was giving proof of his exclusiveness by adopting a sharp, haughty tone in speaking to an inferior, the great gentleman, affable, pleasant, smiling, had the air of considering, practising an affectation of humility and patience, a pretence of being just one of the audience, as a privilege of his good breeding. It is quite likely that, on seeing him thus dissemble behind a smile overflowing with good nature the barred threshold of the little world apart which he carried in his person, more than one wealthy banker�s son, entering the theatre at that moment, would have taken this great gentleman for a person of no importance if he had not remarked in him an astonishing resemblance to the portrait that had recently appeared in the illustrated papers of a nephew of the Austrian Emperor, the Prince of Saxony, who happened to be in Paris at the time. I knew him to be a great friend of the Guermantes. As I reached the attendant I heard the Prince of Saxony (or his double) say with a smile: �I don�t know the number; it was my cousin who told me I had only to ask for her box.�  ���He may well have been the Prince of Saxony; it was perhaps of the Duchesse de Guermantes (whom, in that event, I should be able to watch in the process of living one of those moments of her unimaginable life in her cousin�s box) that his eyes formed a mental picture when he referred to �my cousin who told me I had only to ask for her box,� so much so that that smiling gaze peculiar to himself, those so simple words caressed my heart (far more gently than would any abstract meditation) with the alternative feelers of a possible happiness and a vague distinction. Whatever he was, in uttering this sentence to the attendant he grafted upon a commonplace evening in my everyday life a potential outlet into a new world; the passage to which he was directed after mentioning the word �box� and along which he now proceeded was moist and mildewed and seemed to lead to subaqueous grottoes, to the mythical kingdom of the water-nymphs. I had before me a gentleman in evening dress who was walking away from me, but I kept playing upon and round him, as with a badly fitting reflector on a lamp, and without ever succeeding in making it actually coincide with him, the idea that he was the Prince of Saxony and was on his way to join the Duchesse de Guermantes. And, for all that he was alone, that idea, external to himself, impalpable, immense, unstable as the shadow projected by a magic lantern, seemed to precede and guide him like that deity, invisible to the rest of mankind, who stands beside the Greek warrior in the hour of battle.  ���I took my seat, striving all the time to recapture a line from Ph�dre which I could not quite remember. In the form in which I repeated it to myself it had not the right number of feet, but as I made no attempt to count them, between its unwieldiness and a classical line of poetry it seemed as though no common measure could exist. It would not have surprised me to learn that I must subtract at least half a dozen syllables from that portentous phrase to reduce it to alexandrine dimensions. But suddenly I remembered it, the irremediable asperities of an inhuman world vanished as if by magic; the syllables of the line at once filled up the requisite measure, what there was in excess floated off with the ease, the dexterity of a bubble of air that rises to burst on the water�s brink. And, after all, this excrescence with which I had been struggling consisted of but a single foot.  ���A certain number of orchestra stalls had been offered for sale at the box office and bought, out of snobbishness or curiosity, by such as wished to study the appearance of people whom they might not have another opportunity of seeing at close quarters. And it was indeed a fragment of their true social life, ordinarily kept secret, that one could examine here in public, for, the Princesse de Parme having herself distributed among her friends the seats in stalls, balconies and boxes, the house was like a drawing-room in which everyone changed his place, went to sit here or there wherever he caught sight of a woman whom he knew.  ���Next to me were some common people who, not knowing the regular subscribers, were anxious to shew that they were capable of identifying them and named them aloud. They went on to remark that these subscribers behaved there as though they were in their own drawing-rooms, meaning that they paid no attention to what was being played. Which was the exact opposite of what did happen. A budding genius who had taken a stall in order to hear Berma thinks only of not soiling his gloves, of not disturbing, of making friends with the neighbour whom chance has put beside him, of pursuing with an intermittent smile the fugitive � avoiding with apparent want of politeness the intercepted gaze of a person of his acquaintance whom he has discovered in the audience and to whom, after a thousand indecisions, he makes up his mind to go and talk just as the three hammer-blows from the stage, sounding before he has had time to reach his friend, force him to take flight, like the Hebrews in the Red Sea, through a heaving tide of spectators and spectatresses whom he has obliged to rise and whose dresses he tears as he passes, or tramples on their boots. On the other hand it was because the society people sat in their boxes (behind the general terrace of the balcony, as in so many little drawing-rooms, the fourth walls of which had been removed, or in so many little caf�s, to which one might go for refreshment, without letting oneself be intimidated by the mirrors in gilt frames or the red plush seats, in the Neapolitan style, of the establishment), it was because they rested an indifferent hand on the gilded shafts of the columns which upheld this temple of the lyric art, it was because they remained unmoved by the extravagant honours which seemed to be being paid them by a pair of carved figures which held out towards the boxes branches of palm and laurel, that they and they only would have had minds free to listen to the play, if only they had had minds.  ���At first there was nothing visible but vague shadows, in which one suddenly struck � like the gleam of a precious stone which one cannot see � the phosphorescence of a pair of famous eyes, or, like a medallion of Henri IV on a dark background, the bent profile of the Due d�Aumale, to whom an invisible lady was exclaiming �Monseigneur must allow me to take his coat,� to which the Prince replied, �Oh, come, come! Really, Madame d�Ambresac.� She took it, in spite of this vague prohibition, and was envied by all the rest her being thus honoured.  ���But in the other boxes, everywhere almost, the white deities who inhabited those sombre abodes had flown for shelter against their shadowy walls and remained invisible. Gradually, however, as the performance went on, their vaguely human forms detached themselves, one by one, from the shades of night which they patterned, and, raising themselves towards the light, allowed their semi-nude bodies to emerge, and rose, and stopped at the limit of their course, at the luminous, shaded surface on which their brilliant faces appeared behind the gaily breaking foam of the feather fans they unfurled and lightly waved, beneath their hyacinthine locks begemmed with pearls, which the flow of the tide seemed to have caught and drawn with it; this side of them, began the orchestra stalls, abode of mortals for ever separated from the transparent, shadowy realm to which, at points here and there, served as boundaries, on its brimming surface, the limpid, mirroring eyes of the water-nymphs. For the folding seats on its shore, the forms of the monsters in the stalls were painted upon the surface of those eyes in simple obedience to the laws of optics and according to their angle of incidence, as happens with those two sections of external reality to which, knowing that they do not possess any soul, however rudimentary, that can be considered as analogous to our own, we should think ourselves mad if we addressed a smile or a glance of recognition: namely, minerals and people to whom we have not been introduced. Beyond this boundary, withdrawing from the limit of their domain, the radiant daughters of the sea kept turning at every moment to smile up at the bearded tritons who clung to the anfractuosities of the cliff, or towards some aquatic demi-god, whose head was a polished stone to which the tides had borne a smooth covering of seaweed, and his gaze a disc of rock crystal. They leaned towards these creatures, offering them sweetmeats; sometimes the flood parted to admit a fresh Nereid who, belated, smiling, apologetic, had just floated into blossom out of the shadowy depths; then, the act ended, having no further hope of hearing the melodious sounds of earth which had drawn them to the surface, plunging back all in a moment the several sisters vanished into the night. But of all these retreats, to the thresholds of which their mild desire to behold the works of man brought the curious goddesses who let none approach them, the most famous was the cube of semi-darkness known to the world as the stage box of the Princesse de Guermantes.  ���Like a mighty goddess who presides from far aloft over the sports of lesser deities, the Princess had deliberately remained a little way back on a sofa placed sideways in the box, red as a reef of coral, beside a big, glassy splash of reflexion which was probably a mirror and made one think of the section cut by a ray of sunlight, vertical, clear, liquid, through the flashing crystal of the sea. At once plume and blossom, like certain subaqueous growths, a great white flower, downy as the wing of a bird, fell from the brow of the Princess along one of her cheeks, the curve of which it followed with a pliancy, coquettish, amorous, alive, and seemed almost to enfold it like a rosy egg in the softness of a halcyon�s nest. Over her hair, reaching in front to her eyebrows and caught back lower down at the level of her throat, was spread a net upon which those little white shells which are gathered on some shore of the South Seas alternated with pearls, a marine mosaic barely emerging from the waves and at every moment plunged back again into a darkness in the depths of which even then a human presence was revealed by the ubiquitous flashing of the Princess�s eyes. The beauty which set her far above all the other fabulous daughters of the dusk was not altogether materially and comprehensively inscribed on her neck, her shoulders, her arms, her figure. But the exquisite, unfinished line of the last was the exact starting point, the inevitable focus of invisible lines which the eye could not help prolonging, marvellous lines, springing into life round the woman like the spectrum of an ideal form projected upon the screen of darkness.  ��� �That�s the Princesse de Guermantes,� said my neighbour to the gentleman beside her, taking care to begin the word �Princesse� with a string of P�s, to shew that a title like that was absurd. �She hasn�t been sparing with her pearls. I�m sure, if I had as many as that, I wouldn�t make such a display of them; it doesn�t look at all well, not to my mind.�  ���And yet, when they caught sight of the Princess, all those who were looking round to see who was in the audience felt springing up for her in their hearts the rightful throne of beauty. Indeed, with the Duchesse de Luxembourg, with Mme. de Morienval, with Mme. de Saint-Euverte, and any number of others, what enabled one to identify their faces would be the juxtaposition of a big red nose to a hare-lip, or of a pair of wrinkled cheeks to a faint moustache. These features were nevertheless sufficient in themselves to attract the eye, since having merely the conventional value of a written document they gave one to read a famous and impressive name; but also they gave one, cumulatively, the idea that ugliness had about it something aristocratic, and that it was unnecessary that the face of a great lady, provided it was distinguished, should be beautiful as well. But like certain artists who, instead of the letters of their names, set at the foot of their canvas a form that is beautiful in itself, a butterfly, a lizard, a flower, so it was the form of a delicious face and figure that the Princess had put in the corner of her box, thereby shewing that beauty can be the noblest of signatures; for the presence there of Mme. de Guermantes-Bavi�re, who brought to the theatre only such persons as at other times formed part of her intimate circle, was in the eyes of specialists in aristocracy the best possible certificate of the authenticity of the picture which her box presented, a sort of evocation of a scene in the ordinary private life of the Princess in her palaces in Munich and in Paris.  ���Our imagination being like a barrel organ out of order, which always plays some other tune than that shewn on its card, every time that I had heard any mention of the Princesse de Guermantes-Bavi�re, a recollection of certain sixteenth-century masterpieces had begun singing in my brain. I was obliged to rid myself quickly of this association, now that I saw her engaged in offering crystallised fruit to a stout gentleman in a swallowtail coat. Certainly I was very far from the conclusion that she and her guests were mere human beings like the rest of the audience. I understood that what they were doing there was all only a game, and that as a prelude to the acts of their real life (of which, presumably, this was not where they spent the important part) they had arranged, in obedience to a ritual unknown to me, they were feigning to offer and decline sweetmeats, a gesture robbed of its ordinary significance and regulated beforehand like the step of a dancer who alternately raises herself on her toes and circles about an upheld scarf. For all I knew, perhaps at the moment of offering him her sweetmeats the goddess was saying, with that note of irony in her voice (for I saw her smile): �Do have one, won�t you?� What mattered that to me? I should have found a delicious refinement in the deliberate dryness, in the style of M�rim�e or Meilhac, of such words addressed by a goddess to a demi-god who, conscious himself what were the sublime thoughts which they both had in their minds, in reserve, doubtless, until the moment when they would begin again to live their true life, consenting to join in the game, was answering with the same mysterious bitterness: �Thanks; I should like a cherry.� And I should have listened to this dialogue with the same avidity as to a scene from Le Mari de la D�butante, where the absence of poetry, of lofty thoughts, things so familiar to me which, I suppose, Meilhac could easily, had he chosen, have put into it a thousand times over, seemed to me in itself a refinement, a conventional refinement and therefore all the more mysterious and instructive.  ��� �That fat fellow is the Marquis de Ganan�ay,� came in a knowing tone from the man next to me, who had not quite caught the name whispered in the row behind.  ���The Marquis de Palancy, his face bent downwards at the end of his long neck, his round bulging eye glued to the glass of his monocle, was moving with a leisurely displacement through the transparent shade and appeared no more to see the public in the stalls than a fish that drifts past, unconscious of the press of curious gazers, behind the glass wall of an aquarium. Now and again he paused, a venerable, wheezing monument, and the audience could not have told whether he was in pain, asleep, swimming, about to spawn, or merely taking breath. No one else aroused in me so much envy as he, on account of his apparent familiarity with this box and the indifference with which he allowed the Princess to hold out to him her box of sweetmeats; throwing him, at the same time, a glance from her fine eyes, cut in a pair of diamonds which at such moments wit and friendliness seemed to liquefy, whereas, when they were at rest, reduced to their purely material beauty, to their mineral brilliance alone, if the least reflected flash disturbed them ever so slightly, they set the darkness ablaze with inhuman horizontal splendid fires. But now, because the act ofPh�dre in which Berma was playing was due to start, the Princess came to the front of the box; whereupon, as if she herself were a theatrical production, in the zone of light which she traversed, I saw not only the colour but the material of her adornments change. And in the box, dry now, emerging, a part no longer of the watery realm, the Princess, ceasing to be a Nereid, appeared turbanned in white and blue like some marvellous tragic actress dressed for the part of Za�re, or perhaps of Orosmane; finally, when she had taken her place in the front row I saw that the soft halcyon�s nest which tenderly shielded the rosy nacre of her cheeks was � downy, dazzling, velvety, an immense bird of paradise.  ���But now my gaze was diverted from the Princesse de Guermantes�s box by a little woman who came in, ill-dressed, plain, her eyes ablaze with indignation, followed by two young men, and sat down a few places from me. At length the curtain went up. I could not help being saddened by the reflexion that there remained now no trace of my old disposition, at the period when, so as to miss nothing of the extraordinary phenomenon which I would have gone to the ends of the earth to see, I kept my mind prepared, like the sensitive plates which astronomers take out to Africa, to the West Indies, to make and record an exact observation of a comet or an eclipse; when I trembled for fear lest some cloud (a fit of ill humour on the artist�s part or an incident in the audience) should prevent the spectacle from presenting itself with the maximum of intensity; when I should not have believed that I was watching it in the most perfect conditions had I not gone to the very theatre which was consecrated to it like an altar, in which I then felt to be still a part of it, though an accessory part only, the officials with their white carnations, appointed by her, the vaulted balcony covering a pit filled with a shabbily dressed crowd, the women selling programmes that had her photograph, the chestnut trees in the square outside, all those companions, those confidants of my impressions of those days which seemed to me to be inseparable from them. Ph�dre, the �Declaration Scene,� Berma, had had then for me a sort of absolute existence. Standing aloof from the world of current experience they existed by themselves, I must go to meet them, I should penetrate what I could of them, and if I opened my eyes and soul to their fullest extent I should still absorb but a very little of them. But how pleasant life seemed to me: the triviality of the form of it that I myself was leading mattered nothing, no more than the time we spend on dressing, on getting ready to go out, since, transcending it, there existed in an absolute form, good and difficult to approach, impossible to possess in their entirety, those more solid realities,  Ph�dre and the way in which Berma spoke her part. Steeped in these dreams of perfection in the dramatic art (a strong dose of which anyone who had at that time subjected my mind to analysis at any moment of the day or even the night would have been able to prepare from it), I was like a battery that accumulates and stores up electricity. And a time had come when, ill as I was, even if I had believed that I should die of it, I should still have been compelled to go and hear Berma. But now, like a hill which from a distance seems a patch of azure sky, but, as we draw nearer, returns to its place in our ordinary field of vision, all this had left the world of the absolute and was no more than a thing like other things, of which I took cognisance because I was there, the actors were people of the same substance as the people I knew, trying to speak in the best possible way these lines of Ph�dre, which themselves no longer formed a sublime and individual essence, distinct from everything else, but were simply more or less effective lines ready to slip back into the vast corpus of French poetry, of which they were merely a part. I felt a discouragement that was all the more profound in that, if the object of my headstrong and active desire no longer existed, the same tendencies, on the other hand, to indulge in a perpetual dream, which varied from year to year but led me always to sudden impulses, regardless of danger, still persisted. The day on which I rose from my bed of sickness and set out to see, in some country house or other, a picture by Elstir or a mediaeval tapestry, was so like the day on which I ought to have started for Venice, or that on which I did go to hear Berma, or start for Balbec, that I felt before going that the immediate object of my sacrifice would, after a little while, leave me cold, that then I might pass close by the place without stopping even to look at that picture, those tapestries for which I would at this moment risk so many sleepless nights, so many hours of pain. I discerned in the instability of its object the vanity of my effort, and at the same time its vastness, which I had not before noticed, like a neurasthenic whose exhaustion we double by pointing out to him that he is exhausted. In the meantime my musings gave a distinction to everything that had any connexion with them. And even in my most carnal desires, magnetised always in a certain direction, concentrated about a single dream, I might have recognised as their primary motive an idea, an idea for which I would have laid down my life, at the innermost core of which, as in my day dreams while I sat reading all afternoon in the garden at Combray, lay the thought of perfection.  ���I no longer felt the same indulgence as on the former occasion towards the deliberate expressions of affection or anger which I had then remarked in the delivery and gestures of Aricie, Ism�ne and Hippolyte. It was not that the players � they were the same, by the way � did not still seek, with the same intelligent application, to impart now a caressing inflexion, or a calculated ambiguity to their voices, now a tragic amplitude, or a suppliant meekness to their movements. Their intonations bade the voice: �Be gentle, sing like a nightingale, caress and woo�; or else, �now wax furious,� and then hurled themselves upon it, trying to carry it off with them in their frenzied rush. But it, mutinous, independent of their diction, remained unalterably their natural voice with its material defects or charms, its everyday vulgarity or affectation, and thus presented a sum-total of acoustic or social phenomena which the sentiment contained in the lines they were repeating was powerless to alter.  ���Similarly the gestures of the players said to their arms, to their garments: �Be majestic.� But each of these unsubmissive members allowed to flaunt itself between shoulder and elbow a biceps which knew nothing of the part; they continued to express the triviality of everyday life and to bring into prominence, instead of fine shades of Racinian meaning, mere muscular attachments; and the draperies which they held up fell back again along vertical lines in which the natural law that governs falling bodies was challenged only by an insipid textile pliancy. At this point the little woman who was sitting near me exclaimed:  ��� �Not a hand! Did you ever see such a get-up? She�s too old; she can�t play the part; she ought to have retired ages ago.�  ���Amid a sibilant protest from their neighbours the two young men with her succeeded in making her keep quiet and her fury raged now only in her eyes. This fury could, moreover, be prompted only by the thought of success, of fame, for Berma, who had earned so much money, was overwhelmed with debts. Since she was always making business or social appointments which she was prevented from keeping, she had messengers flying with apologies along every street in Paris, and what with rooms in hotels which she would never occupy engaged in advance, oceans of scent to bathe her dogs, heavy penalties for breaches of contract with all her managers, failing any more serious expense and being not so voluptuous as Cleopatra, she would have found the means of squandering on telegrams and jobmasters provinces and kingdoms. But the little woman was an actress who had never tasted success, and had vowed a deadly hatred against Berma. The latter had just corne on to the stage. And then � oh, the miracle � like those lessons which we laboured in vain to learn overnight, and find intact, got by heart, on waking up next morning, like, too, those faces of dead friends which the impassioned efforts of our memory pursue without recapturing them, and which, when we are no longer thinking of them, are there before our eyes just as they were in life � the talent of Berma, which had evaded me when I sought so greedily to seize its essential quality, now, after these years of oblivion, in this hour of indifference, imposed itself, with all the force of a thing directly seen, on my admiration. Formerly, in my attempts to isolate the talent, I deducted, so to speak, from what I heard the part itself, a part common to all the actresses who appeared as Ph�dre, which I had myself studied beforehand so that I might be capable of subtracting it, of receiving in the strained residue only the talent of Mme. Berma. But this talent which I sought to discover outside the part itself was indissolubly one with it. So with a great musician (it appears that this was the case with Vinteuil when he played the piano), his playing is that of so fine a pianist that one cannot even be certain whether the performer is a pianist at all, since (not interposing all that mechanism of muscular effort, crowned here and there with brilliant effects, all that spattering shower of notes in which at least the listener who does not quite know where he is thinks that he can discern talent in its material, tangible objectivity) his playing is become so transparent, so full of what he is interpreting, that himself one no longer sees and he is nothing now but a window opening upon a great work of art. The intentions which surrounded, like a majestic or delicate border, the voice and mimicry of Aricie, Ism�ne or Hippolyte I had been able to distinguish, but Ph�dre had taken hers into herself, and my mind had not succeeded in wresting from her diction and attitudes, in apprehending in the miserly simplicity of their unbroken surfaces those treasures, those effects of which no sign emerged, so completely had they been absorbed. Berma�s voice, in which not one atom of lifeless matter refractory to the mind remained undissolved, did not allow any sign to be discernible around it of that overflow of tears which one could feel, because they had not been able to absorb it in themselves, trickling over the marble voice of Aricie or Ism�ne, but had been brought to an exquisite perfection in each of its tiniest cells like the instrument of a master violinist, in whom one means, when one says that his music has a fine sound, to praise not a physical peculiarity but a superiority of soul; and, as in the classical landscape where in the place of a vanished nymph there is an inanimate waterspring, a clear and concrete intention had been transformed into a certain quality of tone, strangely, appropriately, coldly limpid. Berma�s arms, which the lines themselves, by the same dynamic force that made the words issue from her lips, seemed to raise on to her bosom like leaves disturbed by a gush o� water; her attitude, on the stage, which she had gradually built up, which she was to modify yet further, and which was based upon reasonings of a different profundity from those of which traces might be seen in the gestures of her fellow-actors, but of reasonings that had lost their original deliberation, and had melted into a sort of radiance in which they sent throbbing, round the person of the heroine, elements rich and complex, but which the fascinated spectator took not as an artistic triumph but as a natural gift; those white veils themselves, which, tenuous and clinging, seemed to be of a living substance and to have been woven by the suffering, half-pagan, half-Jansenist, around which they drew close like a frail, shrinking chrysalis; all of them, voice, attitude, gestures, veils, were nothing more, round this embodiment of an idea, which a line of poetry is (an embodiment that, unlike our human bodies, covers the soul not with an opaque screen which prevents us from seeing it, but with a purified, a quickened garment through which the soul is diffused and we discover it), than additional envelopes which instead of concealing shewed up in greater splendour the soul that had assimilated them to itself and had spread itself through them, than layers of different substances, grown translucent, the interpolation of which has the effect only of causing a richer refraction of the imprisoned, central ray that pierces through them, and of making more extensive, more precious and more fair the matter purified by fire in which it is enshrined. So Berma�s interpretation was, around Racine�s work, a second work, quickened also by the breath of genius.  ���My own impression, to tell the truth, though more pleasant than on the earlier occasion, was not really different. Only, I no longer put it to the test of a pre-existent, abstract and false idea of dramatic genius, and I understood now that dramatic genius was precisely this. It had just occurred to me that if I had not derived any pleasure from my first hearing of Berma, it was because, as earlier still when I used to meet Gilberte in the Champs-Elys�es, I had come to her with too strong a desire. Between my two disappointments there was perhaps not only this resemblance, but another more profound. The impression given us by a person or a work (or a rendering, for that matter) of marked individuality is peculiar to that person or work. We have brought to it the ideas of �beauty,� �breadth of style,� �pathos� and so forth which we might, failing anything better, have had the illusion of discovering in the commonplace show of a �correct� face or talent, but our critical spirit has before it the insistent challenge of a form of which it possesses no intellectual equivalent, in which it must detect and isolate the unknown element. It hears a shrill sound, an oddly interrogative intonation. It asks itself: �Is that good? Is what I am feeling just now admiration? Is that richness of colouring, nobility, strength?� And what answers it again is a shrill voice, a curiously questioning tone, the despotic impression caused by a person whom one does not know, wholly material, in which there is no room left for �breadth of interpretation.� And for this reason it is the really beautiful works that, if we listen to them with sincerity, must disappoint us most keenly, because in the storehouse of our ideas there is none that corresponds to an individual impression.  ���This was precisely what Berma�s acting shewed me. This was what was meant by nobility, by intelligence of diction. Now I could appreciate the worth of a broad, poetical, powerful interpretation, or rather it was to this that those epithets were conventionally applied, but only as we give the names of Mars, Venus, Saturn to planets which have no place in classical mythology. We feel in one world, we think, we give names to things in another; between the two we can establish a certain correspondence, but not bridge the interval. It was quite narrow, this interval, this fault that I had had to cross when, that afternoon on which I went first to bear Berma, having strained my ears to catch every word, I had found some difficulty in correlating my ideas of �nobility of interpretation,� of �originality,� and had broken out in applause only after a moment of unconsciousness and as if my applause sprang not from my actual impression but was connected in some way with my preconceived ideas, with the pleasure that I found in saying to myself: �At last I am listening to Berma.� And the difference that there is between a person, or a work of art which is markedly individual and the idea of beauty, exists just as much between what they make us feel and the idea of love, or of admiration. Wherefore we fail to recognise them. I had found no pleasure in listening to Berma (any more than, earlier still, in seeing Gilberte). I had said to myself: �Well, I do not admire this.� But then I was thinking only of mastering the secret of Berma�s acting, I was preoccupied with that alone, I was trying to open my mind as wide as possible to receive all that her acting contained. I understood now that all this amounted to nothing more nor less than admiration.  ���This genius of which Berma�s rendering of the part was only the revelation, was it indeed the genius of Racine and nothing more?  ���I thought so at first. I was soon to be undeceived when the curtain fell on the act from Ph�dre, amid enthusiastic recalls from the audience, through which the old actress, beside herself with rage, drawing her little body up to its full height, turning sideways in her seat, stiffened the muscles of her face and folded her arms on her bosom to shew that she was not joining the others in their applause, and to make more noticeable a protest which to her appeared sensational though it passed unperceived. The piece that followed was one of those novelties which at one time I had expected, since they were not famous, to be inevitably trivial and of no general application, devoid as they were of any existence outside the performance that was being given of them at the moment. But I had not with them as with a classic the disappointment of seeing the infinity and eternity of a masterpiece occupy no more space or time than the width of the footlights and the length of a performance which would finish it as effectively as a piece written for the occasion. Besides, at every fresh passage which, I felt, had appealed to the audience and would onc day be famous, in place of the fame which it was prevented from having won in the past I added that which it would enjoy in the future, by a mental process the converse of that which consists in imagining masterpieces on the day of their first thin performance, when it seemed inconceivable that a title which no one had ever heard before could one day be set, bathed in the same mellow light, beside those of the author�s other works. And this part would be set one day in the list of her finest impersonations, next to that of Ph�dre. Not that in itself it was not destitute of all literary merit. But Berma was as sublime in one as in the other. I realised then that the work of the playwright was for the actress no more than the material, the nature of which was comparatively unimportant, for the creation of her masterpiece of interpretation, just as the great painter whom I had met at Balbec, Elstir, had found the inspiration for two pictures of equal merit in a school building without any character and a cathedral which was in itself a work of art. And as the painter dissolves houses, carts, people, in some broad effect of light which makes them all alike, so Berma spread out great sheets of terror or tenderness over words that were all melted together in a common mould, lowered or raised to one level, which a lesser artist would have carefully detached from one another. No doubt each of them had an inflexion of its own, and Berma�s diction did not prevent one from catching the rhythm of the verse. Is it not already a first element of ordered complexity, of beauty, when, on hearing a rhyme, that is to say something which is at once similar to and different from the preceding rhyme, which was prompted by it, but introduces the variety of a new idea, one is conscious of two systems overlapping each other, one intellectual, the other prosodie? But Berma at the same time made her words, her lines, her whole speeches even, flow into lakes of sound vaster than themselves, at the margins of which it was a joy to see them obliged to stop, to break off; thus it is that a poet takes pleasure in making hesitate for a moment at the rhyming point the word which is about to spring forth, and a composer in merging the various words of his libretto in a single rhythm which contradicts, captures and controls them. Thus into the prose sentences of the modern playwright as into the poetry of Racine Berma managed to introduce those vast images of grief, nobility, passion, which were the masterpieces of her own personal art, and in which she could be recognised as, in the portraits which he has made of different sitters, we recognise a painter.  ���I had no longer any desire, as on the former occasion, to be able to arrest and perpetuate Berma�s attitudes, the fine colour effect which she gave for a moment only in a beam of limelight which at once faded never to reappear, nor to make her repeat a single line a hundred times over. I realised that my original desire had been more exacting than the intentions of the poet, the actress, the great decorative artist who supervised her productions, and that that charm which floated over a line as it was spoken, those unstable poses perpetually transformed into others, those successive pictures were the transient result, the momentary object, the changing masterpiece which the art of the theatre undertook to create and which would perish were an attempt made to fix it for all time by a too much enraptured listener. I did not even make a resolution to come back another day and hear Berma again. I was satisfied with her; it was when I admired too keenly not to be disappointed by the object of my admiration, whether that object were Gilberte or Berma, that I demanded in advance, of the impression to be received on the morrow, the pleasure that yesterday�s impression had refused to afford me. Without seeking to analyse the joy which I had begun now to feel, and might perhaps have been turning to some more profitable use, I said to myself, as in the old days I might have said to one of my schoolfellows: �Certainly, I put Berma first!� not without a confused feeling that Berma�s genius was not, perhaps, very accurately represented by this affirmation of my preference, or this award to her of a �first� place, whatever the peace of mind that it might incidentally restore to me.  ���Just as the curtain was rising on this second play I looked up at Mme. de Guermantes�s box. The Princess was in the act � by a movement that called into being an exquisite line which my mind pursued into the void � of turning her head towards the back of the box; her party were all standing, and also turning towards the back, and between the double hedge which they thus formed, with all the assurance, the grandeur of the goddess that she was, but with a strange meekness which so late an arrival, making every one else get up in the middle of the performance, blended with the white muslin in which she was attired, just as an adroitly compounded air of simplicity, shyness and confusion tempered her triumphant smile, the Duchesse de Guermantes, who had at that moment entered the box, came towards her cousin, made a profound obeisance to a young man with fair hair who was seated in the front row, and turning again towards the amphibian monsters who were floating in the recesses of the cavern, gave to these demi-gods of the Jockey Club � who at that moment, and among them all M. de Palancy in particular, were the men whom I should most have liked to be � the familiar �good evening� of an old and intimate friend, an allusion to the daily sequence of her relations with them during the last fifteen years. I felt the mystery, but could not solve the riddle of that smiling gaze which she addressed to her friends, in the azure brilliance with which it glowed while she surrendered her hand to one and then to another, a gaze which, could I have broken up its prism, analysed its crystallisation, might perhaps have revealed to me the essential quality of the unknown form of life which became apparent in it at that moment. The Duc de Guermantes followed his wife, the flash of his monocle, the gleam of his teeth, the whiteness of his carnation or of his pleated shirt-front scattering, to make room for their light, the darkness of his eyebrows, lips and coat; with a wave of his outstretched hand which he let drop on to their shoulders, vertically, without moving his head, he commanded the inferior monsters, who were making way for him, to resume their seats, and made a profound bow to the fair young man. One would have said that the Duchess had guessed that her cousin, of whom, it was rumoured, she was inclined to make fun for what she called her �exaggerations� (a name which, from her own point of view, so typically French and restrained, would naturally be applied to the poetry and enthusiasm of the Teuton), would be wearing this evening one of those costumes in which the Duchess thought of her as �dressed up,� and that she had decided to give her a lesson in good taste. Instead of the wonderful downy plumage which, from the crown of the Princess�s head, fell and swept her throat, instead of her net of shells and pearls, the Duchess wore in her hair only a simple aigrette, which, rising above her arched nose and level eyes, reminded one of the crest on the head of a bird. Her neck and shoulders emerged from a drift of snow-white muslin, against which fluttered a swansdown fan, but below this her gown, the bodice of which had for its sole ornament innumerable spangles (either little sticks and beads of metal, or possibly brilliants), moulded her figure with a precision that was positively British. But different as their two costumes were, after the Princess had given her cousin the chair in which she herself had previously been sitting, they could be seen turning to gaze at one another in mutual appreciation.  ���Possibly a smile would curve the lips of Mme. de Guermantes when next day she referred to the headdress, a little too complicated, which the Princess had worn, but certainly she would declare that it had been, all the same, quite lovely, and marvellously arranged; and the Princess, whose own tastes found something a little cold, a little austere, a little �tailor-made� in her cousin�s way of dressing, would discover in this rigid sobriety an exquisite refinement. Moreover the harmony that existed between them, the universal and pre-established gravitation exercised by their upbringing, neutralised the contrasts not only in their apparel but in their attitude. By those invisible magnetic longitudes which the refinement of their manners traced between them the expansive nature of the Princess was stopped short, while on the other side the formal correctness of the Duchess allowed itself to be attracted and relaxed, turned to sweetness and charm. As, in the play which was now being performed, to realise how much personal poetry Berma extracted from it one had only to entrust the part which she was playing, which she alone could play, to no matter what other actress, so the spectator who should raise his eyes to the balcony might see in two smaller boxes there how an �arrangement� supposed to suggest that of the Princesse de Guermantes simply made the Baronne de Morienval appear eccentric, pretentious and ill-bred, while an effort, as painstaking as it must have been costly, to imitate the clothes and style of the Duchesse de Guermantes only made Mme. de Cambremer look like some provincial schoolgirl, mounted on wires, rigid, erect, dry, angular, with a plume of raven�s feathers stuck vertically in her hair. Perhaps the proper place for this lady was not a theatre in which it was only with the brightest stars of the season that the boxes (even those in the highest tier, which from below seemed like great hampers brimming with human flowers and fastened to the gallery on which they stood by the red cords of their plush-covered partitions) composed a panorama which deaths, scandals, illnesses, quarrels would soon alter, but which this evening was held motionless by attention, heat, giddiness, dust, smartness or boredom, in that so to speak everlasting moment of unconscious waiting and calm torpor which, in retrospect, seems always to have preceded the explosion of a bomb or the first flicker of a fire.  ���The explanation of Mme. de Cambremer�s presence on this occasion was that the Princesse de Parme, devoid of snobbishness as are most truly royal personages, and to make up for this devoured by a pride in and passion for charity which held an equal place in her heart with her taste for what she believed to be the Arts, had bestowed a few boxes here and there upon women like Mme. de Cambremer who were not numbered among the highest aristocratic society but with whom she was connected in various charitable undertakings. Mme. de Cambremer never took her eyes off the Duchesse and Princesse de Guermantes, which was all the simpler for her since, not being actually acquainted with either, she could not be suspected of angling for recognition. Inclusion in the visiting lists of these two great ladies was nevertheless the goal towards which she had been marching for the last ten years with untiring patience. She had calculated that she might reach it, possibly, in five years more. But having been smitten by a relentless malady, the inexorable character of which � for she prided herself upon her medical knowledge � she thought she knew, she was afraid that she might not live so long. This evening she was happy at least in the thought that all these women whom she barely knew would see in her company a man who was one of their own set, the young Marquis de Beausergent, Mme. d�Argencourt�s brother, who moved impartially in both worlds and with whom the women of the second were greatly delighted to bedizen themselves before the eyes of those of the first. He was seated behind Mme. de Cambremer on a chair placed at an angle, so that he might rake the other boxes with his glasses. He knew everyone in the house, and, to greet his friends, with the irresistible charm of his beautifully curved figure, and fine fair head, he half rose from his seat, stiffening his body, a smile brightening his blue eyes, with a blend of deference and detachment, a picture delicately engraved, in its rectangular frame, and placed at an angle to the wall, like one of those old prints which portray a great nobleman in his courtly pride. He often accepted these invitations to go with Mme. de Cambremer to the play. In the theatre itself, and on their way out, in the lobby, he stood gallantly by her side in the thick of the throng of more brilliant friends whom he saw about him, and to whom he refrained from speaking, to avoid any awkwardness, just as though he had been in doubtful company. If at such moments there swept by him the Princesse de Guermantes, lightfoot and fair as Diana, letting trail behind her the folds of an incomparable cloak, turning after her every head and followed by every eye (and, most of all, by Mme. de Cambremer�s), M. de Beausergent would become absorbed in conversation with his companion, acknowledging the friendly and dazzling smile of the Princess only with constraint, under compulsion, and with the well-bred reserve, the considerate coldness of a person whose friendliness might at the moment have been inconvenient.  ���Had not Mme. de Cambremer known already that the box belonged to the Princess, she could still have told that the Duchesse de Guermantes was the guest from the air of keener interest with which she was surveying the spectacle of stage and stalls, out of politeness to her hostess. But simultaneously with this centrifugal force, an equal and opposite force generated by the same desire to be sociable drew her attention back to her own attire, her plume, her necklace, her bodice and also to that of the Princess, whose subject, whose slave her cousin seemed thus to proclaim herself, come thither solely to see her, ready to follow her elsewhere should it have taken the fancy of the official occupant of the box to rise and leave, and regarding as composed merely of strangers, worth looking at simply as curiosities, the rest of the house, in which, nevertheless, she numbered many friends to whose boxes she regularly repaired on other evenings and with regard to whom she never failed on those occasions to demonstrate a similar loyalism, exclusive, conditional and hebdomadary. Mme. de Cambremer was surprised to see her there that evening. She knew that the Duchess was staying on very late at Guermantes, and had supposed her to be there still. But she had been told, also, that sometimes, when there was some special function in Paris which she considered it worth her while to attend, Mme. de Guermantes would order one of her carriages to be brought round as soon as she had taken tea with the guns, and, as the sun was setting, start out at a spanking pace through the gathering darkness of the forest, then over the high road, to join the train at Combray and so be in Paris the same evening. �Perhaps she has come up from Guermantes on purpose to hear Berma,� thought Mme. de Cambremer, and marvelled at the thought. And she remembered having heard Swann say in that ambiguous jargon which he used in common with M. de Charlus: �The Duchess is one of the noblest souls in Paris, the cream of the most refined, the choicest society.� For myself, who derived from the names Guermantes, Bavaria and Cond� what I imagined to be the life, the thoughts of the two cousins (I could no longer so ascribe their faces, having seen them), I would rather have had their opinion of Ph�dre than that of the greatest critic in the world. For in his I should have found merely intellect, an intellect superior to my own but similar in kind. But what the Duchesse and Princesse de Guermantes might think, an opinion which would have furnished me with an invaluable clue to the nature of these two poetic creatures, I imagined with the aid of their names, I endowed with an irrational charm, and, with the thirst, the longing of a fever-stricken wretch, what I demanded that their opinion of Ph�dre should yield to me was the charm of the summer afternoons that I had spent in wandering along the Guermantes way.  ���Mme. de Cambremer was trying to make out how exactly the cousins were dressed. For my own part, I never doubted that their garments were peculiar to themselves, not merely in the sense in which the livery with red collar or blue facings had belonged once exclusively to the houses of Guermantes and Cond�, but rather as is peculiar to a bird the plumage which, as well as being a heightening of its beauty, is an extension of its body. The toilet of these two ladies seemed to me like a materialisation, snow-white or patterned with colour, of their internal activity, and, like the gestures which I had seen the Princesse de Guermantes make, with no doubt in my own mind that they corresponded to some idea latent in hers, the plumes which swept downward from her brow, and her cousin�s glittering spangled bodice seemed each to have a special meaning, to be to one or the other lady an attribute which was hers and hers alone, the significance of which I would eagerly have learned; the bird of paradise seemed inseparable from its wearer as her peacock is from Juno, and I did not believe that any other woman could usurp that spangled bodice, any more than the fringed and flashing aegis of Minerva. And when I turned my eyes to their box, far more than on the ceiling of the theatre, painted with cold and lifeless allegories, it was as though I had seen, thanks to a miraculous rending of the clouds that ordinarily veiled it, the Assembly of the Gods in the act of contemplating the spectacle of mankind, beneath a crimsor canopy, in a clear lighted space, between two pillars of Heaven. I gazed on this brief transfiguration with a disturbance which was partly soothed by the feeling that I myself was unknown to these Immortals; the Duchess had indeed seen me once with her husband, but could surely have kept no memory of that, and it gave me no pain that she found herself, owing to the place that she occupied in the box, in a position to gaze down upon the nameless, collective madrepores of the public in the stalls, for I had the happy sense that my own personality had been dissolved in theirs, when, at the moment in which, by the force of certain optical laws, there must, I suppose, have come to paint itself on the impassive current of those blue eyes the blurred outline of the protozoon, devoid of any individual existence, which was myself, I saw a ray illumine them; the Duchess, goddess turned woman, and appearing in that moment a thousand times more lovely, raised, pointed in my direction the white-gloved hand which had been resting on the balustrade of the box, waved it at me in token of friendship; my gaze felt itself trapped in the spontaneous incandescence of the flashing eyes of the Princess, who had unconsciously set them ablaze merely by turning her head to see who it might be that her cousin was thus greeting, while the Duchess, who had remembered me, showered upon me the sparkling and celestial torrent of her smile.  ���And now every morning, long before the hour at which she would appear, I went by a devious course to post myself at the corner of the street along which she generally came, and, when the moment of her arrival seemed imminent, strolled homewards with an air of being absorbed in something else, looking the other way and raising my eyes to her face as I drew level with her, but as though I had not in the least expected to see her. Indeed, for the first few mornings, so as to be sure of not missing her, I waited opposite the house. And every time that the carriage gate opened (letting out one after another so many people who were none of them she for whom I was waiting) its grinding rattle continued in my heart in a series of oscillations which it took me a long time to subdue. For never was devotee of a famous actress whom he did not know, posting himself and patrolling the pavement outside the stage door, never was angry or idolatrous crowd, gathered to insult or to carry in triumph through the streets the condemned assassin or the national hero whom it believes to be on the point of coming whenever a sound is heard from the inside of the prison or the palace, never were these so stirred by their emotion as I was, awaiting the emergence of this great lady who in her simple attire was able, by the grace of her movements (quite different from the gait she affected on entering a drawing-room or a box), to make of her morning walk � and for me there was no one in the world but herself out walking � a whole poem of elegant refinement and the finest ornament, the most curious flower of the season. But after the third day, so that the porter should not discover my stratagem, I betook myself much farther afield, to some point upon the Duchess�s usual route. Often before that evening at the theatre I had made similar little excursions before luncheon when the weather was fine; if it had been raining, at the first gleam of sunshine I would hasten downstairs to take a turn, and if, suddenly, coming towards me, on the still wet pavement changed by the sun into a golden lacquer, in the transformation scene of a crossroads dusty with a grey mist which the sun tanned and gilded, I caught sight of a schoolgirl followed by her governess or of a dairy-maid with her white sleeves, I stood motionless, my hand pressed to my heart which was already leaping towards an unexplored form of life; I tried to bear in mind the street, the time, the number of the door through which the girl (whom I followed sometimes) had vanished and failed to reappear. Fortunately the fleeting nature of these cherished images, which I promised myself that I would make an effort to see again, prevented them from fixing themselves with any vividness in my memory. No matter, I was less sad now at the thought of my own ill health, of my never having summoned up courage to set to work, to begin a book, the world appeared to me now a pleasanter place to live in, life a more interesting experience now that I had learned that the streets of Paris, like the roads round Balbec, were aflower with those unknown beauties whom I had so often sought to evoke from the woods of M�s�glise, each one of whom aroused a sensual longing which she alone appeared capable of assuaging.  ���On coming home from the Op�ra-Comique I had added for next morning to the list of those which for some days past I had been hoping to meet again the form of Mme. de Guermantes, tall, with her high-piled crown of silky, golden hair; with the kindness promised me in the smile which she had directed at me from her cousin�s box. I would follow the course which Fran�oise had told me that the Duchess generally took, and I would try at the same time, in the hope of meeting two girls whom I had seen a few days earlier, not to miss the break-up of their respective class and catechism. But in the mean time, ever and again, the scintillating smile of Mme. de Guermantes, the pleasant sensation it had given me, returned. And without exactly knowing what I was doing, I tried to find a place for them (as a woman studies the possible effect on her dress of some set of jewelled buttons that have just been given her) beside the romantic ideas which I had long held and which Albertine�s coldness, Gis�le�s premature departure, ana before them my deliberate and too long sustained separation from Gilberte, had set free (the idea, for instance of being loved by a woman, of having a life in common with her); next, it had been the image of one or other of the two girls seen in the street that I brought into relation with those ideas, to which immediately afterwards I was trying to adapt my memory of the Duchess. Compared with those ideas my memory of Mme. de Guermantes at the Op�ra-Comique was a very little thing, a tiny star twinkling beside the long tail of a blazing comet; moreover I had been quite familiar with the ideas long before I came to know Mme. de Guermantes; my memory of her, on the contrary, I possessed but imperfectly; every now and then it escaped me; it was during the hours when, from floating vaguely in my mind in the same way as the images of various other pretty women, it passed gradually into a unique and definite association � exclusive of every other feminine form � with those romantic ideas of so much longer standing than itself, it was during those few hours in which I remembered it most clearly that I ought to have taken steps to find out exactly what it was; but I did not then know the importance which it was to assume for me; it was pleasant merely as a first private meeting with Mme. de Guermantes inside myself, it was the first, the only accurate sketch, the only one taken from life, the only one that was really Mme. de Guermantes; during the few hours in which I was fortunate enough to retain it without having the sense to pay it any attention, it must all the same have been charming, that memory, since it was always to it, and quite freely moreover, to that moment, without haste, without strain, without the slightest compulsion or anxiety, that my ideas of love returned; then, as gradually those ideas fixed it more definitely, it acquired from them a proportionately greater strength but itself became more vague; presently I could no longer recapture it; and in my dreams I probably altered it completely, for whenever I saw Mme. de Guermantes I realised the difference � never twice, as it happened, the same � between what I had imagined and what I saw. And now every morning, certainly at the moment when Mme. de Guermantes emerged from her gateway at the top of the street I saw again her tall figure, her face with its bright eyes and crown of silken hair � all the things for which I was there waiting; but, on the other hand, a minute or two later, when, having first turned my eyes away so as to appear not to be waiting for this encounter which I had come out to seek, I raised them to look at the Duchess at the moment in which we converged, what I saw then were red patches (as to which I knew not whether they were due to the fresh air or to a faulty complexion) on a sullen face which with the curtest of nods, a long way removed from the affability of the Ph�dre evening, acknowledged my salute, which I addressed to her daily with an air of surprise, and which did not seem to please her. And yet, after a few days, during which the memory of the two girls fought against heavy odds for the mastery of my amorous feelings against that of Mme. de Guermantes, it was in the end the latter which, as though of its own accord, generally prevailed while its competitors withdrew; it was to it that I finally found myself, deliberately moreover, and as though by preference and for my own pleasure, to have transferred all my thoughts of love. I had ceased to dream of the little girls coming from their catechism, or of a certain dairy-maid; and yet I had also lost all hope of encountering in the street what I had come out to seek, either the affection promised to me, at the theatre, in a smile, or the profile, the bright face beneath its pile of golden hair which were so only when seen from afar. Now I should not even have been able to say what Mme. de Guermantes was like, by what I recognised her, for every day, in the picture which she presented as a whole, the face was different, as were the dress and the hat.  ���Why did I one morning, when I saw bearing down on me beneath a violet hood a sweet, smooth face whose charms were symmetrically arranged about a pair of blue eyes, a face in which the curve of the nose seemed to have been absorbed, gauge from a joyous commotion in my bosom that I was not going to return home without having caught a glimpse of Mme. de Guermantes; and on the next feel the same disturbance, affect the same indifference, turn away my eyes in the same careless manner as on the day before, on the apparition, seen in profile as she crossed from a side street and crowned by a navy-blue toque, of a beak-like nose bounding a flushed cheek chequered with a piercing eye, like some Egyptian deity? Once it was not merely a woman with a bird�s beak that I saw but almost the bird itself; the outer garments, even the toque of Mme. de Guermantes were of fur, and since she thus left no cloth visible, she seemed naturally furred, like certain vultures whose thick, smooth, dusky, downy plumage suggests rather the skin of a wild beast. From the midst of this natural plumage, the tiny head arched out its beak and the two eyes on its surface were piercing-keen and blue.  ���One day I had been pacing up and down the street for hours on end without a vestige of Mme. de Guermantes when suddenly, inside a pastrycook�s shop tucked in between two of the mansions of this aristocratic and plebeian quarter, there appeared, took shape the vague and unfamiliar face of a fashionably dressed woman who was asking to see some little cakes, and, before I had had time to make her out, there shot forth at me like a lightning flash, reaching me sooner than its accompaniment of thunder, the glance of the Duchess; another time, having failed to meet her and hearing twelve strike, I realised that it was not worth my while to wait for her any longer, I Was sorrowfully making my way homewards; and, absorbed in my own disappointment, looking absently after and not seeing a carriage that had overtaken me, I realised suddenly that the movement of her head which I saw a lady make through the carriage window was meant for me, and that this lady, whose features, relaxed and pale, or it might equally be tense and vivid, composed, beneath a round hat which nestled at the foot of a towering plume, the face of a stranger whom I had supposed that I did not know, was Mme. de Guermantes, by whom I had let myself be greeted without so much as acknowledging her bow. And sometimes I came upon her as I entered the gate, standing outside the lodge where the detestable porter whose scrutinous eye I loathed and dreaded was in the act of making her a profound obeisance and also, no doubt, his daily report. For the entire staff of the Guermantes household, hidden behind the window curtains, were trembling as they watched a conversation which they were unable to overhear, but which meant as they very well knew that one or other of them would certainly have his �day out� stopped by the Duchess to whom this Cerberus was betraying him. In view of the whole series of different faces which Mme. Guermantes displayed thus one after another, faces that occupied a relative and varying extent, contracted one day, vast the next, in her person and attire as a whole, my love was not attached to any one of those changeable and ever-changing elements of flesh and fabric which replaced one another as day followed day, and which she could modify, could almost entirely reconstruct without altering my disturbance because beneath them, beneath the new collar and the strange cheek, I felt that it was still Mme. de Guermantes. What I loved was the invisible person who set all this outward show in motion, her whose hostility so distressed me, whose approach set me trembling, whose life I would fain have made my own and driven out of it her friends. She might flaunt a blue feather or shew a fiery cheek without her actions� losing their importance for me.  ���I should not myself have felt that Mme. de Guermantes was tired of meeting me day after day, had I not learned it indirectly by reading it on the face, stiff with coldness, disapproval and pity which Fran�oise shewed when she was helping me to get ready for these morning walks. The moment I asked her for my outdoor things I felt a contrary wind arise in her worn and battered features. I made no attempt to win her confidence, for I knew that I should not succeed. She had, for at once discovering any unpleasant thing that might have happened to my parents or myself, a power the nature of which I have never been able to fathom. Perhaps it was not supernatural, but was to be explained by sourees of information that were open to her alone: as it may happen that the news which often reaches a savage tribe several days before the post has brought it to the European colony has really been transmitted to them not by telepathy but from hill-top to hill-top by a chain of beacon fires. So, in the particular instance of my morning walks, possibly Mme. de Guermantes�s servants had heard their mistress say how tired she was of running into me every day without fail wherever she went, and had repeated her remarks to Fran�oise. My parents might, it is true, have attached some servant other than Fran�oise to my person, still I should have been no better off. Fran�oise was in a sense less of a servant than the others. In her way of feeling things, of being kind and pitiful, hard and distant, superior and narrow, of combining a white skin with red hands, she was still the village maiden whose parents had had �a place of their own� but having come to grief had been obliged to put her into service. Her presence in our household was the country air, the social life of a farm of fifty years ago wafted to us by a sort of reversal of the normal order of travel whereby it is the place that comes to visit the person. As the glass cases in a local museum are filled with specimens of the curious handiwork which the peasants still carve or embroider or whatever it may be in certain parts of the country, so our flat in Paris was decorated with the words of Fran�oise, inspired by a traditional local sentiment and governed by extremely ancient laws. And she could in Paris find her way back as though by clues of coloured thread to the songbirds and cherry trees of her childhood, to her mother�s deathbed, which she still vividly saw. But in spite of all this wealth of background, once she had come to Paris and had entered our service she had acquired � as, obviously, anyone else coming there in her place would have acquired � the ideas, the system of interpretation used by the servants on the other floors, compensating for the respect which she was obliged to shew to us by repeating the rude words that the cook on the fourth floor had used to her mistress, with a servile gratification so intense that, for the first time in our lives, feeling a sort of solidarity between ourselves and the detestable occupant of the fourth floor flat, we said to ourselves that possibly we too were �employers� after all. This alteration in Fran�oise�� character was perhaps inevitable. Certain forms of existence are so abnormal that they are bound to produce certain characteristic faults; such was the life led by the King at Versailles among his courtiers, a life as strange as that of a Pharaoh or a Doge � and, far more even than his, the life of his courtiers. The life led by our servants is probably of an even more monstrous abnormality, which only its familiarity can prevent us from seeing. But it was actually in details more intimate still that I should have been obliged, if I had dismissed Fran�oise, to keep the same servant. For various others might, in years to come, enter my service; already furnished with the defects common to all servants, they underwent nevertheless a rapid transformation with me. As, in the rules of tactics, an attack in one sector compels a counter-attack in another, so as not to be hurt by the asperities of my nature, all of them effected in their own an identical resilience, always at the same points, and to make up for this took advantage of the gaps in my line to thrust out advanced posts. Of these gaps I knew nothing, any more than of the salients to which they gave rise, precisely because they were gaps. But my servants, by gradually becoming spoiled, taught me of their existence. It was from the defects which they invariably acquired that I learned what were my own natural and invariable shortcomings; their character offered me a sort of negative plate of my own. We had always laughed, my mother and I, at Mme. Sazerat, who used, in speaking of her servants, expressions like �the lower orders� or �the servant class.� But I am bound to admit that what made it useless to think of replacing Fran�oise by anyone else was that her successor would inevitably have belonged just as much to the race of servants in general and to the class of my servants in particular.  ���To return to Fran�oise, I never in my life experienced any humiliation without having seen beforehand on her face a store of condolences prepared and waiting; and if then in my anger at the thought of being pitied by her I tried to pretend that on the contrary I had scored a distinct success, my lies broke feebly on the wall of her respectful but obvious unbelief and the consciousness that she enjoyed of her own infallibility. For she knew the truth. She refrained from uttering it, and made only a slight movement with her lips as if she still bad her mouth full and was finishing a tasty morsel. She refrained from uttering it, or so at least I long believed, for at that time I still supposed that it was by means of words that one communicated the truth to others. Indeed the words that people used to me recorded their meaning so unalterably on the sensitive plate of my mind that I could no more believe it to be possible that anyone who had professed to love me did not love me than Fran�oise herself could have doubted when she had read it in a newspaper that some clergyman or gentleman was prepared, on receipt of a stamped envelope, to furnish us free of charge with an infallible remedy for every known complaint or with the means of multiplying our income an hundredfold. (If, on the other hand, our doctor were to prescribe for her the simplest ointment to cure a cold in the head, she, so stubborn to endure the keenest suffering, would complain bitterly of what she had been made to sniff, insisting that it tickled her nose and that life was not worth living.) But she was the first person to prove to me by her example (which I was not to understand until, long afterwards, when it was given me afresh and to my greater discomfort, as will be found in the later volumes of this work, by a person who was dearer to me than Fran�oise) that the truth has no need to be uttered to be made apparent, and that one may perhaps gather it with more certainty, without waiting for words, without even bothering one�s head about them, from a thousand outward signs, even from certain invisible phenomena, analogous in the sphere of human character to what in nature are atmospheric changes. I might perhaps have suspected this. since to myself at that time it frequently occurred that I said things in which there was no vestige of truth, while I made the real truth plain by all manner of involuntary confidences expressed by my body and in my actions (which were at once interpreted by Fran�oise); I ought perhaps to have suspected it, but to do so I should first have had to be conscious that I myself was occasionally untruthful and dishonest. Now untruthfulness and dishonesty were with me, as with most people; called into being in so immediate, so contingent a fashion, and in self-defence, by some particular interest, that my mind, fixed on some lofty ideal, allowed my character, in the darkness below, to set about those urgent, sordid tasks, and did net look down to observe them. When Fran�oise, in the evening, was polite to me, and asked my permission before sitting down in my room, it seemed as though her face became transparent and I could see the goodness and honesty that lay beneath. But Jupien, who had lapses into indiscretion of which I learned only later, revealed afterwards that she had told him that I was not worth the price of a rope to hang me, and that I had tried to insult her in every possible way. These words of Jupien set up at once before my eyes, in new and strange colours, a print of the picture of my relations with Fran�oise so different from that on which I used to like letting my eyes rest, and in which, without the least possibility of doubt, Fran�oise adored me and lost no opportunity of singing my praises, that I realised that it is not only the material world that is different from the aspect in which we see it; that all reality is perhaps equally dissimilar from what we think ourselves to be directly perceiving; that the trees, the sun and the sky would not be the same as what we see if they were apprehended by creatures having eyes differently constituted from ours, or, better still, endowed for that purpose with organs other than eyes which would furnish trees and sky and sun with equivalents, though not visual. However that might be, this sudden outlet which Jupien threw open for me upon the real world appalled me. So far it was only Fran�oise that was revealed, and of her I barely thought. Was it the same with all one�s social relations? And in what depths of despair might this not some day plunge me, if it were the same with love? That was the future�s secret. For the present only Fran�oise was concerned. Did she sincerely believe what she had said to Jupien? Had she said it to embroil Jupien with me, possibly so that we should not appoint Jupien�s girl as her successor? At any rate I realised the impossibility of obtaining any direct and certain knowledge of whether Fran�oise loved or lothed me. And thus it was she who first gave me the idea that a person does not (as I had imagined) stand motionless and clear before our eyes with his merits, his defects, his plans, his intentions with regard to ourself exposed on his surface, like a garden at which, with all its borders spread out before us, we gaze through a railing, but is a shadow which we can never succeed in penetrating, of which there can be no such thing as direct knowledge, with respect to which we form countless beliefs, based upon his words and sometimes upon his actions, though neither words nor actions can give us anything but inadequate and as it proves contradictory information � a shadow behind which we can alternately imagine, with equal justification, that there burns the flame of hatred and of love.  ���I was genuinely in love with Mme. de Guermantes. The greatest happiness that I could have asked of God would have been that He should overwhelm her under every imaginable calamity, and that ruined, despised, stripped of all the privileges that divided her from me, having no longer any home of her own or people who would condescend to speak to her, she should come to me for refuge. I imagined her doing so. And indeed on those evenings when some change in the atmosphere or in my own condition brought to the surface of my consciousness some forgotten scroll on which were recorded impressions of other days, instead of profiting by the refreshing strength that had been generated in me, instead of employing it to decipher in my own mind thoughts which as a rule escaped me, instead of setting myself at last to work, I preferred to relate aloud, to plan out in the third person, with a flow of invention as useless as was my declamation of it, a whole novel crammed with adventure, in which the Duchess, fallen upon misfortune, came to implore assistance from me � me who had become, by a converse change of circumstances, rich and powerful. And when I had let myself thus for hours on end imagine the circumstances, rehearse the sentences with which I should welcome the Duchess beneath my roof, the situation remained unaltered; I had, alas, in reality, chosen to love the very woman who, in her own person, combined perhaps the greatest possible number of different advantages; in whose eyes, accordingly, I could not hope, myself, ever to cut any figure; for she was as rich as the richest commoner � and noble also; without reckoning that personal charm which set her at the pinnacle of fashion, made her among the rest a sort of queen.  ���I felt that I was annoying her by crossing her path in this way every morning; but even if I had had the courage to refrain, for two or three days consecutively, from doing so, perhaps that abstention, which would have represented so great a sacrifice on my part, Mme. de Guermantes would not have noticed, or would have set it down to some obstacle beyond my control. And indeed I could not have succeeded in making myself cease to track her down except by arranging that it should be impossible for me to do so, for the need incessantly reviving in me to meet her, to be for a moment the object of her attention, the person to whom her bow was addressed, was stronger than my fear of arousing her displeasure. I should have had to go away for some time; and for that I had not the heart. I did think of it more than once. I would then tell Fran�oise to pack my boxes, and immediately afterwards to unpack them. And as the spirit of imitation, the desire not to appear behind the times, alters the most natural and most positive form of oneself, Fran�oise, borrowing the expression from her daughter�s vocabulary, used to remark that I was �dippy.� She did not approve of this; she said that I was always �balancing,� for she made use, when she was not aspiring to rival the moderns, of the language of Saint-Simon. It is true that she liked it still less when I spoke to her as master to servant. She knew that this was not natural to me, and did not suit me, a condition which she rendered in words as �where there isn�t a will.� I should never have had the heart to leave Paris except in a direction that would bring me closer to Mme. de Guermantes. This was by no means an impossibility. Should I not indeed find myself nearer to her than I was in the morning, in the street, solitary, abashed, feeling that not a single one of the thoughts which I should have liked to convey to her ever reached her, in that weary patrolling up and down of walks which might be continued, day after day, for ever without the slightest advantage to myself, if I were to go miles away from Mme. de Guermantes, but go to some one of her acquaintance, some one whom she knew to be particular in the choice of his friends and who would appreciate my good qualities, would be able to speak to her about me, and if not to obtain it from her at least to make her know what I wanted, some one by means of whom, in any event, simply because I should discuss with him whether or not it would be possible for him to convey this or that message to her, I should give to my solitary and silent meditations a new form, spoken, active, which would seem an advance, almost a realisation. What she did during the mysterious daily life of the �Guermantes� that she was � this was the constant object of my thoughts; and to break through the mystery, even by indirect means, as with a lever, by employing the services of a person to whom were not forbidden the town house of the Duchess, her parties, unrestricted conversation with her, would not that be a contact more distant but at the same time more effective than my contemplation of her every morning in the street?  ���The friendship, the admiration that Saint-Loup felt for me seemed to me undeserved and had hitherto left me unmoved. All at once I attached a value to them, I would have liked him to disclose them to Mme. de Guermantes, I was quite prepared even to ask him to do so. For when we are in love, all the trifling little privileges that we enjoy we would like to be able to divulge to the woman we love, as people who have been disinherited and bores of other kinds do to us in everyday life. We are distressed by her ignorance of them; we seek consolation in the thought that just because they are never visible she has perhaps added to the opinion which she already had of us this possibility of further advantages that must remain unknown.  ���Saint-Loup had not for a long time been able to come to Paris, whether, as he himself explained, on account of his military duties, or, as was more likely, on account of the trouble that he was having with his mistress, with whom he had twice now been on the point of breaking off relations. He had often told me what a pleasure it would be to him if I came to visit him at that garrison town, the name of which, a couple of days after his leaving Balbec, had caused me so much joy when I had read it on the envelope of the first letter I received from my friend. It was (not so far from Balbec as its wholly inland surroundings might have led one to think) one of those little fortified towns, aristocratic and military, set in a broad expanse of country over which on fine days there floats so often into the distance a sort of intermittent haze of sound which � as a screen of poplars by its sinuosities outlines the course of a river which one cannot see � indicates the movements of a regiment on parade, so that the very atmosphere of its streets, avenues and squares has been gradually tuned to a sort of perpetual vibration, musical and martial, while the most ordinary note of cartwheel or tramway is prolonged in vague trumpet calls, indefinitely repeated, to the hallucinated ear, by the silence. It was not too far away from Paris for me to be able, if I took the express, to return, join my mother and grandmother and sleep in my own bed. As soon as I realised this, troubled by a painful longing, I had too little will power to decide not to return to Paris but rather to stay in this town; but also too little to prevent a porter from carrying my luggage to a cab and not to adopt, as I walked behind him, the unburdened mind of a traveller who is looking after his luggage and for whom no grandmother is waiting anywhere at home, to get into the carriage with the complete detachment of a person who, having ceased to think of what it is that he wants, has the air of knowing what he wants, and to give the driver the address of the cavalry barracks. I thought that Saint-Loup might come to sleep that night at the hotel at which I should be staying, so as to make less painful for me the first shock of contact with this strange town. One of the guard went to find him, and I waited at the barrack gate, before that huge ship of stone, booming with the November wind, out of which, every moment, for it was now six o�clock, men were emerging in pairs into the street, staggering as if they were coming ashore in some foreign port in which they found themselves temporarily anchored.  ���Saint-Loup appeared, moving like a whirlwind, his eyeglass spinning in the air before him; I had not given my name, I was eager to enjoy his surprise and delight. �Oh! What a bore!� he exclaimed, suddenly catching sight of me, and blushing to the tips of his ears. �I have just had a week�s leave, and I shan�t be off duty again for another week.�  ���And, preoccupied by the thought of my having to spend this first night alone, for he knew better than anyone my bed-time agonies, which he had often remarked and soothed at Balbec, he broke off his lamentation to turn and look at me, coax me with little smiles, with tender though unsymmetrical glances, half of them coming directly from his eye, the other half through his eyeglass, but both sorts alike an allusion to the emotion that he felt on seeing me again, an allusion also to that important matter which I did not always understand but which concerned me now vitally, our friendship.  ��� �I say! Where are you going to sleep? Really, I can�t recommend the hotel where we mess; it is next to the Exhibition ground, where there�s a show just starting; you�ll find it beastly crowded. No, you�d better go to the H�tel de Flandre; it is a little eighteenth-century palace with old tapestries. It �makes� quite an �old-world residence.��  ���Saint-Loup employed in every connexion the word �makes� for �has the air of,� because the spoken language, like the written, feels from time to time the need of these alterations in the meanings of words, these refinements of expression. And just as journalists often have not the least idea from what school of literature come the �turns of speech� that they borrow, so the vocabulary, the very diction of Saint-Loup were formed in imitation of three different aesthetes, none of whom he knew personally but whose way of speaking had been indirectly instilled into him. �Besides,� he concluded, �the hotel I mean is more or less adapted to your supersensitiveness of hearing. You will have no neighbours. I quite see that it is a slender advantage, and as, after all, another visitor may arrive to-morrow, it would not be worth your while to choose that particular hotel with so precarious an object in view. No, it is for its appeal to the eye that I recommend it. The rooms are quite attractive, all the furniture is old and comfortable; there is something reassuring about that.� But to me, less of an artist than Saint-Loup, the pleasure that an attractive house could give was superficial, almost non-existent, and could not calm my growing anguish, as painful as that which I used to feel long ago at Combray when my mother did not come upstairs to say good night, or that which I felt on the evening of my arrival at Balbec in the room with the unnaturally high ceiling, which smelt of flowering grasses. Saint-Loup read all this in my fixed gaze.  ��� �A lot you care, though, about this charming palace, my poor fellow; you�re quite pale; and here am I like a great brute talking to you about tapestries which you won�t have the heart to look at, even. I know the room they�ll put you in; personally I find it most enlivening, but I can quite understand that it won�t have the same effect on you with your sensitive nature. You mustn�t think I don�t understand; I don�t feel the same myself, but I can put myself in your place.�  ���At that moment a serjeant who was exercising a horse on the square, entirely absorbed in making the animal jump, disregarding the salutes of passing troopers, but hurling volleys of oaths at such as got in his way, turned with a smile to Saint-Loup and, seeing that he had a friend with him, saluted us. But his horse at once reared. Saint-Loup flung himself at its head, caught it by the bridle, succeeded in quieting it and returned to my side.  ��� �Yes,� he resumed; �I assure you that I fully understand; I feel for you as keenly as you do yourself. I am wretched,� he went on, laying his hand lovingly on my shoulder, �when I think that if I could have stayed with you to-night, I might have been able, if we talked till morning, to relieve you of a little of your unhappiness. I can lend you any number of books, but you won�t want to read if you�re feeling like that. And I shan�t be able to get anyone else to take my duty here; I�ve been off now twice running because my girl came down to see me.�  ���And he knitted his brows partly with vexation and also in the effort to decide, like a doctor, what remedy he might best apply to my disease.  ��� �Run along and light the fire in my quarters,� he called to a trooper who passed us. �Hurry up; get a move on!�  ���After which he turned once more to me, and his eyeglass and his peering, myopic gaze hinted an allusion to our great friendship.  ��� �No! To see you here, in these barracks where I have spent so much time thinking about you, I can scarcely believe my eyes. I must be dreaming. And how are you? Better, I hope. You must tell me all about yourself presently. We�ll go up to my room; we mustn�t hang about too long on the square, there�s the devil of a draught; I don�t feel it now myself, but you aren�t accustomed to it, I�m afraid of your catching cold. And what about your work; have you started yet? No? You are a quaint fellow! If I had your talent I�m sure I should be writing morning, noon and night. It amuses you more to do nothing? What a pity it is that it�s the useless fellows like me who are always ready to work, and the ones who could if they wanted to, won�t. There, and I�ve clean forgotten to ask you how your grandmother is. Her Proudhons are in safe keeping. I never part from them.�  ���An officer, tall, handsome, majestic, emerged with slow and solemn gait from the foot of a staircase. Saint-Loup saluted him and arrested the perpetual instability of his body for the moment occupied in holding his hand against the peak of his cap. But he had flung himself into the action with so much force, straightening himself with so sharp a movement, and, the salute ended, let his hand fall with so abrupt a relaxation, altering all the positions of shoulder, leg, and eyeglass, that this moment was one not so much of immobility as of a throbbing tension in which were neutralised the excessive movements which he had just made and those on which he was about to embark. Meanwhile the officer, without coming any nearer us, calm, benevolent, dignified, imperial, representing, in short, the direct opposite of Saint-Loup, himself also, but without haste, raised his hand to the peak of his cap.  ��� �I must just say a word to the Captain,� whispered Saint-Loup. �Be a good fellow, and go and wait for me in my room. It�s the second on the right, on the third floor; I�ll be with you in a minute.�  ���And setting off at the double, preceded by his eyeglass which fluttered in every direction, he made straight for the slow and stately Captain whose horse had just been brought round and who, before preparing to mount, was giving orders with a studied nobility of gesture as in some historical painting, and as though he were setting forth to take part in some battle of the First Empire, whereas he was simply going to ride home, to the house which he had taken for the period of his service at Donci�res, and which stood in a Square that was named, as though in an ironical anticipation of the arrival of this Napoleonid, Place de la R�publique. I started to climb the staircase, nearly slipping on each of its nail-studded steps, catching glimpses of barrack-rooms, their bare walls edged with a double line of beds and kits. I was shewn Saint-Loup�s room. I stood for a moment outside its closed door, for I could hear some one stirring; he moved something, let fall something else; I felt that the room was not empty, that there must be somebody there. But it was only the freshly lighted fire beginning to burn. It could not keep quiet, it kept shifting its faggots about, and very clumsily. I entered the room; it let one roll into the fender and set another smoking. And even when it was not moving, like an ill-bred person it made noises all the time, which, from the moment I saw the flames rising, revealed themselves to me as noises made by a fire, although if I had been on the other side of a wall I should have thought that they came from some one who was blowing his nose and walking about. I sat down in the room and waited. Liberty hangings and old German stuffs of the eighteenth century managed to rid it of the smell that was exhaled by the rest of the building, a coarse, insipid, mouldy smell like that of stale toast. It was here, in this banning room, that I could have dined and slept with a calm and happy mind Saint-Loup seemed almost to be present by reason of the text-books which littered his table, between his photographs, among which I could make out my own and that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, by the light of the fire which had at length grown accustomed to the grate, and, like an animal crouching in an ardent, noiseless, faithful watchfulness, let fall only now and then a smouldering log which crumbled into sparks, or licked with a tongue of flame the sides of the chimney. I heard the tick of Saint-Loup�s watch, which could not be far away. This tick changed its place every moment �for I could not see the watch; it seemed to come from behind, from in front of me, from my right, from my left, sometimes to die away as though at a great distance. Suddenly I caught sight of the watch on the table. Then I heard the tick in a fixed place from which it did not move again. That is to say, I thought I heard it at this place; I did not hear it there; I saw it there, for sounds have no position in space. Or rather we associate them with movements, and in that way they serve the purpose of warning us of those movements, of appearing to make them necessary and natural. Certainly it happens commonly enough that a sick man whose ears have been stopped with cotton-wool ceases to hear the noise of a fire such as was crackling at that moment in Saint-Loup�s fireplace, labouring at the formation of brands and cinders, which it then lets fall into the fender, nor would he hear the passage of the tramway-cars whose music took its flight, at regular intervals, over the Grand�place of Donci�res. Let the sick man then read a book, and the pages will turn silently before him, as though they were moved by the fingers of a god. The dull thunder of a bath which is being filled becomes thin, faint and distant as the twittering of birds in the sky. The withdrawal of sound, its dilution, take from it all its power to hurt us; driven mad a moment ago by hammer-blows which seemed to be shattering the ceiling above our head, it is with a quiet delight that we now gather in their sound, light, caressing, distant, like the murmur of leaves playing by the roadside with the passing breeze. We play games of patience with cards which we do not hear, until we imagine that we have not touched them, that they are moving of their own accord, and, anticipating our desire to play with them, have begun to play with us. And in this connexion we may ask ourselves whether, in the case of love (to which indeed we may add the love of life and the love of fame, since there are, it appears, persons who are acquainted with these latter sentiments), we ought not to act like those who, when a noise disturbs them, instead of praying that it may cease, stop their ears; and, with them for our pattern, bring our attention, our defensive strength to bear on ourselves, give ourselves as an objective to capture not the �other person� with whom we are in love but our capacity for suffering at that person�s hands.  ���To return to the problem of sounds, we have only to thicken the wads which close the aural passages, and they confine to a pianissimo the girl who has just been playing a boisterous tune overhead; if we go farther, and steep the wad in grease, at once the whole household must obey its despotic rule; its laws extend even beyond our portals. Pianissimo is not enough; the wad instantly orders the piano to be shut, and the music lesson is abruptly ended; the gentleman who was walking up and down in the room above breaks off in the middle of his beat; the movement of carriages and tramways is interrupted as though a Sovereign were expected to pass. And indeed this attenuation of sounds sometimes disturbs our slumbers instead of guarding them. Only yesterday the incessant noise in our ears, by describing to us in a continuous narrative all that was happening in the street and in the house, succeeded at length in making us sleep, like L boring book; to-night, through the sheet of silence that is spread over our sleep a shock, louder than the rest, manages to make itself heard, gentle as a sigh, unrelated to any other sound, mysterious; and the call for an explanation which it emits is sufficient to awaken us. Take away for a moment from the sick man the cotton-wool that has been stopping his ears and in a flash the full daylight, the sun of sound dawns afresh, dazzling him, is born again in his universe; in all haste returns the multitude of exiled sounds; we are present, as though it were the chanting of choirs of angels, at the resurrection of the voice. The empty streets are filled for a moment with the whirr of the swift, consecutive wings of the singing tramway-cars. In the bedroom itself, the sick man has created, not, like Prometheus, fire, but the sound of fire. And when we increase or reduce the wads of cottonwool, it is as though we were pressing alternately one and the other of the two pedals with which we have extended the resonant compass of the outer world.  ���Only there are also suppressions of sound which are not temporary. The man who has grown completely deaf cannot even heat a pan of milk by his bedside, but he must keep an eye open to watch, on the tilted lid, for the white, arctic reflexion, like that of a coming snowstorm, which is the warning sign which he is wise to obey, by cutting off (as Our Lord bade the waves be still) the electric current; for already the swelling, jerkily climbing egg of boiling milk-film is reaching its climax in a series of sidelong movements, has filled and set bellying the drooping sails with which the cream has skimmed its surface, sends in a sudden storm a scud of pearly substance flying overboard � sails which the cutting off of the current, if the electric storm is hushed in time, will fold back upon themselves and let fall with the ebbing tide, changed now to magnolia petals. But if the sick man should not be quick enough in taking the necessary precautions, presently, when his drowned books and watch are seen barely emerging from the milky tide, he will be obliged to call the old nurse who, though he be himself an eminent statesman or a famous writer, will tell him that he has no more sense than a child of five. At other times in the magic chamber, between us and the closed door, a person who was not there a moment ago makes his appearance; it is a visitor whom we did not hear coming in, and who merely gesticulates, like a figure in one of those little puppet theatres, so restful for those who have taken a dislike to the spoken tongue. And for this totally deaf man, since the loss of a sense adds as much beauty to the world as its acquisition, it is with ecstasy that he walks now upon an earth grown almost an Eden, in which sound has not yet been created. The highest waterfalls unfold for his eyes alone their ribbons of crystal, stiller than the glassy sea, like the cascades of Paradise. As sound was for him before his deafness the perceptible form in which the cause of a movement was draped, objects moved without sound seemed to be being moved also without cause; deprived of all resonant quality, they shew a spontaneous activity, seem to be alive. They move, halt, become alight of their own accord. Of their own accord they vanish in the air like the winged monsters of prehistoric days. In the solitary and unneighboured home of the deaf man the service which, before his infirmity was complete, was already shewing an increased discretion, was being carried on in silence, is now assured him with a sort of surreptitious deftness, by mutes, as at the court of a fairy-tale king. And, as upon the stage, the building on which the deaf man looks from his window � be it barracks, church, or town hall � is only so much scenery. If one day it should fall to the ground, it may emit a cloud of dust and leave visible ruins; but, less material even than a palace on the stage, though it has not the same exiguity, it will subside in the magic universe without letting the fall of its heavy blocks of stone tarnish, with anything so vulgar as sound, the chastity of the prevailing silence.  ���The silence, though only relative, which reigned in the little barrack-room where I sat waiting was now broken. The door opened and Saint-Loup, dropping his eyeglass, dashed in.  ��� �Ah, my dear Robert, you make yourself very comfortable here,� I said to him; �how jolly it would be if one were allowed to dine and sleep here.�  ���And to be sure, had it not been against the regulations, what repose untinged by sadness I could have tasted there, guarded by that atmosphere of tranquillity, vigilance and gaiety which was maintained by a thousand wills controlled and free from care, a thousand heedless spirits, in that great community called a barracks where, time having taken the form of action, the sad bell that tolled the hours outside was replaced by the same joyous clarion of those martial calls, the ringing memory of which was kept perpetually alive in the paved streets of the town, like the dust that floats in a sunbeam; � a voice sure of being heard, and musical because it was the command not only of authority to obedience but of wisdom to happiness.  ��� �So you�d rather stay with me and sleep here, would you, than to go the hotel by yourself?� Saint-Loup asked me, smiling.  ��� �Oh, Robert, it is cruel of you to be sarcastic about it,� I pleaded; �you know it�s not possible, and you know how wretched I shall be over there.�  ��� �Good! You flatter me!� he replied. �It occurred to me just now that you would rather stay here to-night. And that is precisely what I stopped to ask the Captain.�  ��� �And he has given you leave?� I cried.  ��� �He hadn�t the slightest objection.�  ��� �Oh! I adore him!�  ��� �No; that would be going too far. But now, let me just get hold of my batman and tell him to see about our dinner,� he went on, while I turned away so as to hide my tears.  ���We were several times interrupted by one or other of Saint-Loup�s friends� coming in. He drove them all out again.  ��� �Get out of here. Buzz off!�  ���I begged him to let them stay.  ��� �No, really; they would bore you stiff; they are absolutely uncultured; all they can talk about is racing, or stables shop. Besides, I don�t want them here either; they would spoil these precious moments I�ve been looking forward to. But you mustn�t think, when I tell you that these fellows are brainless, that everything military is devoid of intellectuality. Far from it. We have a major here who is a splendid chap. He�s given us a course in which military history is treated like a demonstration, like a problem in algebra. Even from the aesthetic point of view there is a curious beauty, alternately inductive and deductive, about it which you couldn�t fail to appreciate.�  ��� �That�s not the officer who�s given me leave to stay here to-night?�  ��� �No; thank God! The man you �adore� for so very trifling a service is the biggest fool that ever walked the face of the earth. He is perfect at looking after messing, and at kit inspections; he spends hours with the serjeant major and the master tailor. There you have his mentality. Apart from that he has a vast contempt, like everyone here, for the excellent major I was telling you about. No one will speak to him because he�s a freemason and doesn�t go to confession. The Prince de Borodino would never have an outsider like that in his house. Which is pretty fair cheek, when all�s said and done, from a man whose great-grandfather was a small farmer, and who would probably be a small farmer himself if it hadn�t been for the Napoleonic wars. Not that he hasn�t a lurking sense of his own rather ambiguous position in society, where he�s neither flesh nor fowl. He hardly ever shews his face at the Jockey, it makes him feel so deuced awkward, this so-called Prince,� added Robert, who, having been led by the same spirit of imitation to adopt the social theories of his teachers and the worldly prejudices of his relatives, had unconsciously wedded the democratic love of humanity to a contempt for the nobility of the Empire.  ���I was looking at the photograph of his aunt, and the thought that, since Saint-Loup had this photograph in his possession, he might perhaps give it to me, made me feel all the fonder of him and hope to do him a thousand services, which seemed to me a very small exchange for it. For this photograph was like one encounter more, added to all those that I had already had, with Mme. de Guermantes; better still, a prolonged encounter, as if, by some sudden stride forward in our relations, she had stopped beside me, in a garden hat, and had allowed me for the first time to gaze at my leisure at that plump cheek, that arched neck, that tapering eyebrow (veiled from me hitherto by the swiftness of her passage, the bewilderment of my impressions, the imperfection of memory); and the contemplation of them, as well as of the bare bosom and arms of a woman whom I had never seen save in a high-necked and long-sleeved bodice, was to me a voluptuous discovery, a priceless favour. Those lines, which had seemed to me almost a forbidden spectacle, I could study there, as in a text-book of the only geometry that had any value for me. Later on, when I looked at Robert, I noticed that he too was a little like the photograph of his aunt, and by a mysterious process which I found almost as moving, since, if his face had not been directly created by hers, the two had nevertheless a common origin. The features of the Duchesse de Guermantes, which were pinned to my vision of Combray, the nose like a falcon�s beak, the piercing eyes, seemed to have served also as a pattern for the cutting out � in another copy analogous and slender, with too delicate a skin � of Robert�s face, which might almost be superimposed upon his aunt�s. I saw in him, with a keen longing, those features characteristic of the Guermantes, of that race which had remained so individual in the midst of a world with which it was not confounded, in which it remained isolated in the glory of an ornithomorphic divinity, for it seemed to have been the issue, in the age of mythology, of the union of a goddess with a bird.  ���Robert, without being aware of its cause, was touched by my evident affection. This was moreover increased by the sense of comfort inspired in me by the heat of the fire and by the champagne which bedewed at the same time my brow with beads of sweat and my cheeks with tears; it washed down the partridges; I ate mine with the dumb wonder of a profane mortal of any sort when he finds in a form of life with which he is not familiar what he has supposed that form of life to exclude � the wonder, for instance, of an atheist who sits down to an exquisitely cooked dinner in a presbytery. And next morning, when I awoke, I rose and went to cast from Saint-Loup�s window, which being at a great height overlooked the whole countryside, a curious scrutiny to make the acquaintance of my new neighbour, the landscape which I had not been able to distinguish the day before, having arrived too late, at an hour when it was already sleeping beneath the outspread cloak of night. And yet, early as it had awoken from its sleep, I could see the ground, when I opened the window and looked out, only as one sees it from the window of a country house, overlooking the lake, shrouded still in its soft white morning gown of mist which scarcely allowed me to make out anything at all. But I knew that, before the troopers who were busy with their horses in the square had finished grooming them, it would have cast its gown aside. In the meantime, I could see only a meagre hill, rearing close up against the side of the barracks a back already swept clear of darkness, rough and wrinkled. Through the transparent curtain of frost I could not take my eyes from this stranger who, too, was looking at me for the first time. But when I had formed the habit of coming to the barracks, my consciousness that the hill was there, more real, consequently, even when I did not see it, than the hotel at Balbec, than our house in Paris, of which I thought as of absent � or dead � friends, that is to say without any strong belief in their existence, brought it about that, even although I was not aware of it myself, its reflected shape outlined itself on the slightest impressions that I formed at Donci�res, and among them, to begin with this first morning, on the pleasing impression of warmth given me by the cup of chocolate prepared by Saint-Loup�s batman in this comfortable room, which had the effect of being an optical centre from which to look out at the hill � the idea of there being anything else to do but just gaze at it, the idea of actually climbing it, being rendered impossible by this same mist. Imbibing the shape of the hill, associated with the taste of hot chocolate and with the whole web of my fancies at that particular time, this mist, without my having thought at all about it, succeeded in moistening all my subsequent thoughts about that period, just as a massive and unmelting lump of gold had remained allied to my impressions of Balbec, or as the proximity of the outside stairs of blackish sandstone gave a grey background to my impressions of Combray. It did not, however, persist late into the day; the sun began by hurling at it, in vain, a few darts which sprinkled it with brilliants before they finally overcame it. The hill might expose its grizzled rump to the sun�s rays, which, an hour later, when I went down to the town, gave to the russet tints of the autumn leaves, to the reds and blues of the election posters pasted on the walls, an exaltation which raised my spirits also and made me stamp, singing as I went, on the pavements from which I could hardly keep myself from jumping in the air for joy.  ���But after that first night I had to sleep at the hotel. And I knew beforehand that I was doomed to find sorrow there. It was like an unbreathable aroma which all my life long had been exhaled for me by every new bedroom, that is to say by every bedroom; in the one which I usually occupied I was not present, my mind remained elsewhere, and in its place sent only the sense of familiarity. But I could not employ this servant, less sensitive than myself, to look after things for me in a new place, where I preceded him, where I arrived by myself, where I must bring into contact with its environment that �Self� which I rediscovered only at year-long intervals, but always the same, having not grown at all since Combray, since my first arrival at Balbec, weeping, without any possibility of consolation, on the edge of an unpacked trunk.  ���As it happened, I was mistaken. I had no time to be sad, for I was not left alone for an instant. The fact of the matter was that there remained of the old palace a superfluous refinement of structure and decoration, out of place in a modern hotel, which, released from the service of any practical purpose, had in its long spell of leisure acquired a sort of life: passages winding about in all directions, which one was continually crossing in their aimless wanderings, lobbies as long as corridors and as ornate as drawing-rooms, which had the air rather of being dwellers there themselves than of forming part of a dwelling, which could not be induced to enter and settle down in any of the rooms but wandered about outside mine and came up at once to offer me their company � neighbours of a sort, idle but never noisy, menial ghosts of the past who had been granted the privilege of staying, provided they kept quiet, by the doors of the rooms which were let to visitors, and who, every time that I came across them, greeted me with a silent deference. In short, the idea of a lodging, of simply a case for our existence from day to day which shields us only from the cold and from being overlooked by other people, was absolutely inapplicable to this house, an assembly of rooms as real as a colony of people, living, it was true, in silence, but things which one was obliged to meet, to avoid, to appreciate, as one came in. One tried not to disturb them, and one could not look without respect at the great drawing-room which had formed, far back in the eighteenth century, the habit of stretching itself at its ease, among its hangings of old gold and beneath the clouds of its painted ceiling. And one was seized with a more personal curiosity as to the smaller rooms which, without any regard for symmetry, ran all round it, innumerable, startled, fleeing in disorder as far as the garden, to which they had so easy an access down three broken steps.  ���If I wished to go out or to come in without taking the lift or being seen from the main staircase, a smaller private staircase, no longer in use, offered me its steps so skilfully arranged, one close above another, that there seemed to exist in their gradation a perfect proportion of the same kind as those which, in colours, scents, savours, often arouse in us a peculiar, sensuous pleasure. But the pleasure to be found in going up and downstairs I had had to come here to learn, as once before to a health resort in the Alps to find that the act � as a rule not noticed � of drawing breath could be a perpetual delight. I received that dispensation from effort which is granted to us only by the things to which long use has accustomed us, when I set my feet for the first time on those steps, familiar before ever I knew them, as if they possessed, deposited on them, perhaps, embodied in them by the masters of long ago whom they used to welcome every day, the prospective charm of habits which I had not yet contracted and which indeed could only grow weaker once they had become my own. I looked into a room; the double doors closed themselves behind me, the hangings let in a silence in which I felt myself invested with a sort of exhilarating royalty; a marble mantelpiece with ornaments of wrought brass � of which one would have been wrong to think that its sole idea was to represent the art of the Directory � offered me a fire, and a little easy chair on short legs helped me to warm myself as comfortably as if I had been sitting on the hearthrug. The walls held the room in � close embrace, separating it from the rest of the world and, to let in, to enclose what made it complete, parted to make way for the bookcase, reserved a place for the bed, on either side of which a column airily upheld the raised ceiling of the alcove. And the room was prolonged in depth by two closets as large as itself, the latter of which had hanging from its wall, to scent the occasion on which one had recourse to it, a voluptuous rosary of orris-roots; the doors, if I left them open when I withdrew into this innermost retreat, were not content with tripling its dimensions without its ceasing to be well-proportioned, and not only allowed my eyes to enjoy the delights of extension after those of concentration, but added further to the pleasure of my solitude, which, while still inviolable, was no longer shut in, the sense of liberty. This closet looked out upon a courtyard, a fair solitary stranger whom I was glad to have for a neighbour when next morning my eyes fell on her, a captive between her high walls in which no other window opened, with nothing but two yellowing trees which were enough to give a pinkish softness to the pure sky above.  ���Before going to bed I decided to leave the room in order to explore the whole of my fairy kingdom. I walked down a long gallery which did me homage successively with all that it had to offer me if I could not sleep, an armchair placed waiting in a corner, a spinet, on a table against the wall, a bowl of blue crockery filled with cinerarias, and, in an old frame, the phantom of a lady of long ago whose powdered hair was starred with blue flowers, holding in her hand a bunch of carnations. When I came to the end, the bare wall in which no door opened said to me simply �Now you must turn and go back, but, you see, you are at home here, the house is yours,� while the soft carpet, not to be left out, added that if I did not sleep that night I could easily come in barefoot, and� the unshuttered windows, looking out over the oper, country, assured me that they would hold a sleepless vigil and that, at whatever hour I chose to come in, I need not be afraid of disturbing anyone. And behind a hanging curtain I surprised only a little closet which, stopped by the wall and unable to escape any farther, had hidden itself there with a guilty conscience and gave me a frightened stare from its little round window, glowing blue in the moonlight. I went to bed, but the presence of the eiderdown quilt, of the pillars, of the neat fireplace, by straining my attention to a pitch beyond that of Paris, prevented me from letting myself go upon my habitual train of fancies. And as it is this particular state of strained attention that enfolds our slumbers, acts upon them, modifies them, brings them into line with this or that series of past impressions, the images that filled my dreams that first night were borrowed from a memory entirely distinct from that on which I was in the habit of drawing. If I had been tempted while asleep to let myself be swept back upon my ordinary current of remembrance, the bed to which I was not accustomed, the comfortable attention which I was obliged to pay to the position of my various limbs when I turned over, were sufficient to correct my error, to disentangle and to keep running the new thread of my dreams. It is the same with sleep as with our perception of the external world. It needs only a modification in our habits to make it poetic, it is enough that while undressing we should have dozed off unconsciously upon the bed, for the dimensions of our dream-world to be altered and its beauty felt. We awake, look at our watch, see �four o�clock�; it is only four o�clock in the morning, but we imagine that the whole day has gone by, so vividly does this nap of a few minutes, unsought by us, appear to have come down to us from the skies, by virtue of some divine right, full-bodied, vast, like an Emperor�s orb of gold. In the morning, while worrying over the thought that my grandfather was ready, and was waiting for me to start on our walk along the M�s�glise way, I was awakened by the blare of a regimental band which passed every day beneath my windows. But on several occasions � and I mention these because one cannot properly describe human life unless one shews it soaked in the sleep in which it plunges, which, night after night, sweeps round it as a promontory is encircled by the sea � the intervening layer of sleep was strong enough to bear the shock of the music and I heard nothing. On the other mornings it gave way for a moment; but, still velvety with the refreshment of having slept, my consciousness (like those organs by which, after a local anaesthetic, a cauterisation, not perceived at first, is felt only at the very end and then as a faint burning smart) was touched only gently by the shrill points of the fifes which caressed it with a vague, cool, matutinal warbling; and after this brief interruption in which the silence had turned to music it relapsed into my slumber before even the dragoons had finished passing, depriving me of the latest opening buds of the sparkling clangorous nosegay. And the zone of my consciousness which its springing stems had brushed was so narrow, so circumscribed with sleep that later on, when Saint-Loup asked me whether I had heard the band, I was no longer ertain that the sound of its brasses had not been as imaginary as that which I heard during the day echo, after the slightest noise, from the paved streets of the town. Perhaps I had heard it only in a dream, prompted by my fear of being awakened, or else of not being awakened and so not seeing the regiment march past. For often, when I was still asleep at the moment when, on the contrary, I had supposed that the noise would awaken me, for the next hour I imagined that I was awake, while still drowsing, and I enacted to myself with tenuous shadow-shapes on the screen of my slumber the various scenes of which it deprived me but at which I had the illusion of looking on.  ���What one has meant to do during the day, as it turns out, sleep intervening, one accomplishes only in one�s dreams, that is to say after it has been distorted by sleep into following another line than one would have chosen when awake. The same story branches off and has a different ending. When all is said, the world in which we live when we are asleep is so different that people who have difficulty in going to sleep seek first of all to escape from the waking world. After having desperately, for hours on end, with shut eyes, revolved in their minds thoughts similar to those which they would have had with their eyes open, they take heart again on noticing that the last minute has been crawling under the weight of an argument in formal contradiction of the laws of thought, and their realisation of this, and the brief �absence� to which it points, indicate that the door is now open through which they will perhaps be able, presently, to escape from the perception of the real, to advance to a resting-place more or less remote on the other side, which will mean their having a more or less �good� night. But already a great stride has been made when we turn our back on the real, when we reach the cave in which �auto-suggestions� prepare � like witches � the hell-broth of imaginary maladies or of the recurrence of nervous disorders, and watch for the hour at which the storm that has been gathering during our unconscious sleep will break with sufficient force to make sleep cease.  ���Not far thence is the secret garden in which grow like strange flowers the kinds of sleep, so different one from another, the sleep induced by datura, by the multiple extracts of ether, the sleep of belladonna, of opium, of valerian, flowers whose petals remain shut until the day when the predestined visitor shall come and, touching them, bid them open, and for long hours inhale the aroma of their peculiar dreams into a marvelling and bewildered being. At the end of the garden stands the convent with open windows through which we hear voices repeating the lessons learned before we went to sleep, which we shall know only at the moment of awakening; while, a presage of that moment, sounds the resonant tick of that inward alarum which our preoccupation has so effectively regulated that when our housekeeper comes in with the warning: �It is seven o�clock,� she will find us awake and ready. On the dim walls of that chamber which opens upon our dreams, within which toils without ceasing that oblivion of the sorrows of love whose task, interrupted and brought: to nought at times by a nightmare big with reminiscence, is ever speedily resumed, hang, even after we are awake, the memories of our dreams, but so overshadowed that otten we catch sight of them for the first time only in the broad light of the afternoon when the ray of a similar idea happens by chance to strike them; some of them brilliant and harmonious while we slept, but already so distorted that, having failed to recognise them, we can but hasten to lay them in the earth like dead bodies too quickly decomposed or relics so seriously damaged, so nearly crumbling into dust that the most skilful restorer could not bring them back to their true form or make anything of them. Near the gate is the quarry to which our heavier slumbers repair in search of substances which coat the brain with so unbreakable a glaze that, to awaken the sleeper, his own will is obliged, even on a golden morning, to smite him with mighty blows like a young Siegfried. Beyond this, again, are the nightmares of which the doctors foolishly assert that they tire us more than does insomnia, whereas on the contrary they enable the thinker to escape from the strain of thought; those nightmares with their fantastic picture-books in which our relatives who are dead are shewn meeting with a serious accident which at the same time does not preclude their speedy recovery. Until then we keep them in a little rat-cage, in which they are smaller than white mice and, covered with big red spots, out of each of which a feather sprouts, engage us in Ciceronian dialogues. Next to this picture-book is the revolving disc of awakening, by virtue of which we submit for a moment to the tedium of having to return at once to a house which was pulled down fifty years ago, the memory of which is gradually effaced as sleep grows more distant by a number of others, until we arrive at that memory which the disc presents only when it has ceased to revolve and which coincides with what we shall see with opened eyes.  ���Sometimes I had heard nothing, being in one of those slumbers into which we fall as into a pit from which we are heartily glad to be drawn up a little later, heavy, overfed, digesting all that has been brought to us (as by the nymphs who fed the infant Hercules) by those agile, vegetative powers whose activity is doubled while we sleep.  ���That kind of sleep is called �sleeping like lead,� and it seems as though one has become, oneself, and remains for a few moments after such a sleep is ended, simply a leaden image. One is no longer a person. How then, seeking for one�s mind, one�s personality, as one seeks for a thing that is lost, does one recover one�s own self rather than any other? Why, when one begins again to think, is it not another personality than yesterday�s that is incarnate in one? One fails to see what can dictate the choice, or why, among the millions of human beings any one of whom one might be, it is on him who one was overnight that unerringly one lays one�s hand? What is it that guides us, when there has been an actual interruption � whether it be that our unconsciousness has been complete or our dreams entirely different from ourselves? There has indeed been death, as when the heart has ceased to beat and a rhythmical friction of the tongue revives us. No doubt the room, even if we have seen it only once before, awakens memories to which other, older memories cling. Or were some memories also asleep in us of which we now become conscious? The resurrection at our awakening � after that healing attack of mental alienation which is sleep � must after all be similar to what occurs when we recapture a name, a line, a refrain that we had forgotten. And perhaps the resurrection of the soul after death is to be conceived as a phenomenon of memory.  ���When I had finished sleeping, tempted by the sunlit sky � but discouraged by the chill � of those last autumn mornings, so luminous and so cold, in which winter begins, to get up and look at the trees on which the leaves were indicated now only by a few strokes, golden or rosy, which seemed to have been left in the air, on an invisible web, I raised my head from the pillow and stretched my neck, keeping my body still hidden beneath the bedclothes; like a chrysalis in the process of change I was a dual creature, with the different parts of which a single environment did not agree; for my eyes colour was sufficient, without warmth; my chest on the other hand was anxious for warmth and not for colour. I rose only after my fire had been lighted, and studied the picture, so delicate and transparent, of the pink and golden morning, to which I had now added by artificial means the element of warmth that it lacked, poking my fire which burned and smoked like a good pipe and gave me, as a pipe would have given me, a pleasure at once coarse because it was based upon a material comfort and delicate because beyond it was printed a pure vision. The walls of my dressing-room were covered with a paper on which a violent red background was patterned with black and white flowers, to which it seemed that I should have some difficulty in growing accustomed. But they succeeded only in striking me as novel, in forcing me to enter not into conflict but into contact with them, in modulating the gaiety, the songs of my morning toilet, they succeeded only in imprisoning me in the heart of a sort of poppy, out of which to look at a world which I saw quite differently from in Paris, from the gay screen which was this new dwelling-place, of a different aspect from the house of my parents, and into which flowed a purer air. On certain days, I was agitated by the desire to see my grandmother again, or by the fear that she might be ill, or else it was the memory of some undertaking which I had left half-finished in Paris, and which seemed to have made no progress; sometimes again it was some difficulty in which, even here, I had managed to become involved. One or other of these anxieties had kept me from sleeping, and I was without strength to face my sorrow which in a moment grew to fill the whole of my existence. Then from the hotel I sent a messenger to the barracks, with a line to Saint-Loup: I told him that, should it be materially possible � I knew that it was extremely difficult for him � I should be most grateful if he would look in for a minute. An hour later he arrived; and on hearing his ring at the door I felt myself liberated from my obsessions. I knew that, if they were stronger than I, he was stronger than they, and my attention was diverted from them and concentrated on him who would have to settle them. He had come into the room, and already he had enveloped me in the gust of fresh air in which from before dawn he had been displaying so much activity, a vital atmosphere very different from that of my room, to which I at once adapted myself by appropriate reactions.  ��� �I hope you weren�t angry with me for bothering you; there is something that is worrying me, as you probably guessed.�  ��� �Not at all; I just supposed you wanted to see me, and I thought it very nice of you. I was delighted that you should have sent for me. But what is the trouble? Things not going well? What can I do to help?�  ���He listened to my explanations, and gave careful answers; but before he had uttered a word he had transformed me to his own likeness; compared with the important occupations which kept him so busy, so alert, so happy, the worries which, a moment ago, I had been unable to endure for another instant seemed to me as to him negligible; I was like a man who, not having been able to open his eyes for some days, sends for a doctor, who neatly and gently raises his eyelid, removes from beneath it and shews him a grain of sand; the sufferer is healed and comforted. All my cares resolved themselves into a telegram which Saint-Loup undertook to dispatch. Life seemed to me so different, so delightful; I was flooded with such a surfeit of strength that I longed for action.  ��� �What are you doing now?� I asked him.  ��� �I must leave you, I�m afraid; we�re going on a route march in three quarters of an hour, and I have to be on parade.�  ��� �Then it�s been a great bother to you, coming here?�  ��� �No, no bother at all, the Captain was very good about it; he told me that if it was for you I must go at once; but you understand, I don�t like to seem to be abusing the privilege.�  ��� �But if I got up and dressed quickly and went by myself to the place where you�ll be training, it would interest me immensely, and I could perhaps talk to you during the breaks.�  ��� �I shouldn�t advise you to do that; you have been lying awake, racking your brains over a thing which, I assure you, is not of the slightest importance, but now that it has ceased to worry you, lay your head down on the pillow and go to sleep, which you will find an excellent antidote to the d�min�ralisation of your nerve-cells; only you mustn�t go to sleep too soon, because our band-boys will be coming along under your windows; but as soon as they�ve passed I think you�ll be left in peace, and we shall meet again this evening, at dinner.�  ���But soon I was constantly going to see the regiment being trained in field operations, when I began to take an interest in the military theories which Saint-Loup�s friends used to expound over the dinner-table, and when it had become the chief desire of my life to see at close quarters their various leaders, just as a person who makes music his principal study and spends his life in the concert halls finds pleasure in frequenting the caf�s in which one mingles with the life of the members of the orchestra. To reach the training ground I used to have to take tremendously long walks. In the evening after dinner the longing for sleep made my head drop every now and then as in a swoon. Next morning I realised that I had no more heard the band than, at Balbec, after the evenings on which Saint-Loup had taken me to dinner at Rivebelle, I used to hear the concert on the beach. And at the moment when I wished to rise I had a delicious feeling of incapacity; I felt myself fastened to a deep, invisible ground by the articulations (of which my tiredness made me conscious) of muscular and nutritious roots. I felt myself full of strength; life seemed to extend more amply before me; this was because I had reverted to the good tiredness of my childhood at Combray on the mornings following days on which we had taken the Guermantes walk. Poets make out that we recapture for a moment the self that we were long ago when we enter some house or garden in which we used to live in our youth. But these are most hazardous pilgrimages, which end as often in disappointment as in success. The fixed places, contemporary with different years, it is in ourselves that we should rather seek to find them. This is where the advantage comes in, to a certain extent, of great exhaustion followed by a good night�s rest. Good nights, to make us descend into the most subterranean galleries of sleep, where no reflexion from overnight, no gleam of memory comes to lighten the inward monologue (if so be that it cease not also), turn so effectively the soil and break through the surface stone of our body that we discover there, where our muscles dive down and throw out their twisted roots and breathe the air of the new life, the garden in which as a child we used to play. There is no need to travel in order to see it again; we must dig down inwardly to discover it. What once covered the earth is no longer upon it but beneath; a mere excursion does not suffice for a visit to the dead city, excavation is necessary also. But we shall see how certain impressions, fugitive and fortuitous, carry us back even more effectively to the past, with a more delicate precision, with a flight more light-winged, more immaterial, more headlong, more unerring, more immortal than these organic dislocations.  ���Sometimes my exhaustion was greater still; I had, without any opportunity of going to bed, been following the operations for several days on end. How blessed then was my return to the hotel! As I got into bed I seemed to have escaped at last from the hands of enchanters, sorcerers like those who people the �romances� beloved of our forebears in the seventeenth century. My sleep that night and the lazy morning that followed it were no more than a charming fairy tale. Charming; beneficent perhaps also. I reminded myself that the keenest sufferings have their place of sanctuary, that one can always, when all else fails, find repose. These thoughts carried me far.  ���On days when, although there was no parade, Saint-Loup had to stay in barracks, I used often to go and visit him there. It was a long way; I had to leave the town and cross the viaduct, from either side of which I had an immense view. A strong breeze blew almost always over this high ground, and filled all the buildings erected on three sides of the barrack-square, which howled incessantly like a cave of the winds. While I waited for Robert � he being engaged on some duty or other � outside the door of his room or in the mess, talking to some of his friends to whom he had introduced me (and whom later on I came now and then to see, even when he was not to be there), looking down from the window three hundred feet to the country below, bare now except where recently sown fields, often still soaked with rain and glittering in the sun, shewed a few stripes of green, of the brilliance and translucent limpidity of enamel, I could hear him discussed by the others, and I soon learned what a popular favourite he was. Among many of the volunteers, belonging to other squadrons^ sons of rich business or professional men who looked at the higher aristocratic society only from outside and without penetrating its enclosure, the attraction which they naturally felt towards what they knew of Saint-Loup�s character was reinforced by the distinction that attached in their eyes to the young man whom, on Saturday evenings, when they went on pass to Paris, they had seen supping in the Caf� de la Paix with the Duc d�Uz�s and the Prince d�Orl�ans. And on that account, into his handsome face, his casual way of walking and saluting officers, the perpetual dance of his eyeglass, the affectation shewn in the cut of his service dress � the caps always too high, the breeches of too fine a cloth and too pink a shade � they had introduced the idea of a �tone� which, they were positive, was lacking in the best turned-out officers in the regiment, even the majestic Captain to whom I had been indebted for the privilege of sleeping in barracks, who seemed, in comparison, too pompous and almost common.  ���One of them said that the Captain had bought a new horse. �He can buy as many horses as he likes. I passed Saint-Loup on Sunday morning in the All�e des Acacias; now he�s got some style on a horse!� replied his companion, and knew what he was talking about, for these young fellows belonged to a class which, if it does not frequent the same houses and know the same people, yet, thanks to money and leisure, does not differ from the nobility in its experience of all those refinements of life which money can procure. At any rate their refinement had, in the matter of clothes, for instance, something about it more studied, more impeccable than that free and easy negligence which had so delighted my grandmother in Saint-Loup. It gave quite a thrill to these sons of big stockbrokers or bankers, as they sat eating oysters after the theatre, to see at an adjoining table Serjeant Saint-Loup. And what a tale there was to tell in barracks on Monday night, after a week-end leave, by one of them who was in Robert�s squadron, and to whom he had said how d�ye do �most civilly,� while another, who was not in the same squadron, was quite positive that, in spite of this, Saint-Loup had recognised him, for two or three times he had put up his eyeglass and stared in the speaker�s direction.  ��� �Yes, my brother saw him at the Paix,� said another, who had been spending the day with his mistress; �my brother says his dress coat was cut too loose and didn�t fit him.�  ��� �What was the waistcoat like?�  ��� �He wasn�t wearing a white waistcoat; it was purple, with sort of palms on it; stunning!�  ���To the �old soldiers� (sons of the soil who had never heard of the Jockey Club and simply put Saint-Loup in the category of ultra-rich non-commissioned officers, in which they included all those who, whether bankrupt or not, lived in a certain style, whose income or debts ran into several figures, and who were generous towards their men), the gait, the eyeglass, the breeches, the caps of Saint-Loup, even if they saw in them nothing particularly aristocratic, furnished nevertheless just as much interest and meaning. They recognised in these peculiarities the character, the style which they had assigned once and for all time to this most popular of the �stripes� in the regiment, manners like no one�s else, scornful indifference to what his superior officers might think, which seemed to them the natural corollary of his goodness to his subordinates. The morning cup of coffee in the canteen, the afternoon �lay-down� in the barrack-room seemed pleasanter, somehow, when some old soldier fed the hungering, lazy section with some savoury titbit as to a cap in which Saint-Loup had appeared on parade.  ��� �It was the height of my pack.�  ��� �Come off it, old chap, you don�t expect us to believe that; it couldn�t have been the height of your pack,� interrupted a young college graduate who hoped by using these slang terms not to appear a �learned beggar,� and by venturing on this contradiction to obtain confirmation of a fact the thought of which enchanted him.  ��� �Oh, so it wasn�t the height of my pack, wasn�t it? You measured it, I suppose! I tell you this much, the C. O. glared at it as if he�d have liked to put him in clink. But you needn�t think the great Saint-Loup felt squashed; no, he went and he came, and down with his head and up with his head, and that blinking glass screwed in his eye all the time. We�ll see what the �Capstan� has to say when he hears. Oh, very likely he�ll say nothing, but you may be sure he won�t be pleased. But there�s nothing so wonderful about that cap. I hear he�s got thirty of �em and more at home, at his house in town.�  ��� �Where did you hear that, old man? From our blasted corporal-dog?� asked the young graduate, pedantically displaying the new forms of speech which he had only recently acquired and with which he took a pride in garnishing his conversation.  ��� �Where did I hear it? From his batman; what d�you think?�  ��� �Ah! Now you�re talking. That�s a chap who knows when he�s well off!�  ��� �I should say so! He�s got more in his pocket than I have, certain sure! And besides he gives him all his own things, and everything. He wasn�t getting his grub properly, he says. Along comes de Saint-Loup, and gives cooky hell: �I want him to be properly fed, d�you hear,� he says, �and I don�t care what it costs.��  ���The old soldier made up for the triviality of the words quoted by the emphasis of his tone, in a feeble imitation of the speaker which had an immense success.  ���On leaving the barracks I would take a stroll, and then, to fill up the time before I went, as I did every evening, to dine with Saint-Loup at the hotel in which he and his friends had established their mess, I made for my own, as soon as the sun had set, so as to have a couple of hours in which to rest and read. In the square, the evening light bedecked the pepper-pot turrets of the castle with little pink clouds which matched the colour of the bricks, and completed the harmony by softening the tone of the latter where it bathed them. So strong a current of vitality coursed through my nerves that no amount of movement on my part could exhaust it; each step I took, after touching a stone of the pavement, rebounded off it. I seemed to have growing on my heels the wings of Mercury. One of the fountains was filled with a ruddy glow, while in the other the moonlight had already begun to turn the water opalescent. Between them were children at play, uttering shrill cries, wheeling in circles, obeying some necessity of the hour, like swifts or bats. Next door to the hotel, the old National Courts and the Louis XVI orangery, in which were installed now the savings-bank and the Army Corps headquarters, were lighted from within by the palely gilded globes of their gas-jets which, seen in the still clear daylight outside, suited those vast, tall, eighteenth-century windows from which the last rays of the setting sun had not yet departed, as would have suited a complexion heightened with rouge a headdress of yellow tortoise-shell, and persuaded me to seek out my fireside and the lamp which, alone in the shadowy front of my hotel, was striving to resist the gathering darkness, and for the sake of which I went indoors before it was quite dark, for pleasure, as to an appetising meal. I kept, when I was in my room, the same fulness of sensation that I had felt outside. It gave such an apparent convexity of surface to things which as a rule seem flat and empty, to the yellow flame of the fire, the coarse blue paper on the ceiling, on which the setting sun had scribbled corkscrews and whirligigs, like a schoolboy with a piece of red chalk, the curiously patterned cloth on the round table, on which a ream of essay paper and an inkpot lay in readiness for me, with one of Bergotte�s novels, that ever since then these things have continued to seem to me to be enriched with a whole form of existence which I feel that I should be able to extract from them if it were granted me to set eyes on them again. I thought with joy of the barracks that I had just left and of their weather-cock turning with every wind that blew. Like a diver breathing through a pipe which rises above the surface of the water, I felt that I was in a sense maintaining contact with a healthy, open-air life when I kept as a baiting-place those barracks, that towering observatory, dominating a country-side furrowed with canals of green enamel, into whose various buildings I esteemed as a priceless privilege, which I hoped would last, my freedom to go whenever I chose, always certain of a welcome.  ���At seven o�clock I dressed myself and went out again to dine with Saint-Loup at the hotel where he took his meals. I liked to go there on foot. It was by now pitch dark, and after the third day of my visit there began to blow, as soon as night had fallen, an icy wind which seemed a harbinger of snow. As I walked, I ought not, strictly speaking, to have ceased for a moment to think of Mme. de Guermantes; it was only in the attempt to draw nearer to her that I had come to visit Robert�s garrison. But a memory, a grief, are fleeting things. There are days when they remove so far that we are barely conscious of them, we think that they have gone for ever. Then we pay attention to other things. And the streets of this town had not yet become for me what streets are in the place where one is accustomed to live, simply means of communication between one part and another. The life led by the inhabitants of this unknown world must, it seemed to me, be a marvellous thing, and often the lighted windows of some dwelling-house kept me standing for a long while motionless in the darkness by laying before my eyes the actual and mysterious scenes of an existence into which I might not penetrate. Here the fire-spirit displayed to me in purple colouring the booth of a chestnut seller in which a couple of serjeants, their belts slung over the backs of chairs, were playing cards, never dreaming that a magician�s wand was making them emerge from the night, like a transparency on the stage, and presenting them in their true lineaments at that very moment to the eyes of an arrested passerby whom they could not see. In a little curiosity shop a candle, burned almost to its socket, projecting its warm glow over an engraving reprinted it in sanguine, while, battling against the darkness, the light of the big lamp tanned a scrap of leather, inlaid a dagger with fiery spangles, on pictures which were only bad copies spread a priceless film of gold like the patina of time or the varnish used by a master, made in fact of the whole hovel, in which there was nothing but pinchbeck rubbish, a marvellous composition by Rembrandt. Sometimes I lifted my gaze to some huge old dwelling-house on which the shutters had not been closed and in which amphibious men and women floated slowly to and fro in the rich liquid that after nightfall rose incessantly from the wells of the lamps to fill the rooms to the very brink of the outer walls of stone and glass, the movement of their bodies sending through it long unctuous golden ripples. I proceeded on my way, and often, in the dark alley that ran past the cathedral, as long ago on the road to M�s�glise, the force of my desire caught and held me; it seemed that a woman must be on the point of appearing, to satisfy it; if, in the darkness, I felt suddenly brush past me a skirt, the violence of the pleasure which I then felt made it impossible for me to believe that the contact was accidental and I attempted to seize in my arms a terrified stranger. This gothic alley meant for me something so real that if I had been successful in raising and enjoying a woman there, it would have been impossible for me not to believe that it was the ancient charm of the place that was bringing us together, and even though she were no more than a common street-walker, stationed there every evening, still the wintry night, the strange place, the darkness, the mediaeval atmosphere would have lent her their mysterious glamour. I thought of what might be in store for me; to try to forget Mme. de Guermantes seemed to me a dreadful thing, but reasonable, and for the first time possible, easy perhaps even. In the absolute quiet of this neighbourhood I could hear ahead of me shouted words and laughter which must come from tipsy revellers staggering home. I waited to see them, I stood peering in the direction from which I had heard the sound. But I was obliged to wait for some time, for the surrounding silence was so intense that it allowed to travel with the utmost clearness and strength sounds that were still a long way off. Finally the revellers did appear; not, as I had supposed, in front of me, but ever so far behind. Whether the intersection of sidestreets, the interposition of buildings had, by reverberation, brought about this acoustic error, or because it is very difficult to locate a sound when the place from which it comes is not known, I had been as far wrong over direction as over distance.  ���The wind grew stronger. It was thick and bristling with coming snow. I returned to the main street and jumped on board the little tramway-car on which, from its platform, an officer, without apparently seeing them, was acknowledging the salutes of the loutish soldiers who trudged past along the pavement, their faces daubed crimson by the cold, reminding me, in this little town which the sudden leap from autumn into early winter seemed to have transported farther north, of the rubicund faces which Breughel gives to his merry, junketing, frostbound peasants.  ���And sure enough at the hotel where I was to meet Saint-Loup and his friends and to which the fair now beginning had attracted a number of people from near and far, I found, as I hurried across the courtyard with its glimpses of glowing kitchens in which chickens were turning on spits, pigs were roasting, lobsters being flung, alive, into what the landlord called the �everlasting fire,� an influx (worthy of some Numbering of the People Before Bethlehem such as the old Flemish masters used to paint) of new arrivals who assembled there in groups, asking the landlord or one of his staff (who, if he did not like the look of them, would recommend lodgings elsewhere in the town) whether they could have dinner and beds, while a scullion hurried past holding a struggling fowl by the neck. And similarly, in the big dining-room which I crossed the first day before coming to the smaller room in which my friend was waiting for me, it was of some feast in the Gospels portrayed with a mediaeval simplicity and an exaggeration typically Flemish that one was reminded by the quantity of fish, pullets, grouse, woodcock, pigeons, brought in dressed and garnished and piping hot by breathless waiters who slid over the polished floor to gain speed and set them down on the huge carving table where they were at once cut up but where � for most of the people had nearly finished dinner when I arrived � they accumulated untouched, as though their profusion and the haste of those who brought them in were due not so much to the requirements of the diners as to respect for the sacred text, scrupulously followed in the letter but quaintly illustrated by real details borrowed from local custom, and to an aesthetic and religious scruple for making evident to the eye the solemnity of the feast by the profusion of the victuals and the assiduity of the servers. One of these stood lost in thought at the far end of the room by a sideboard; and to find out from him, who alone appeared calm enough to be capable of answering me, in which room our table had been laid, making my way forward among the chafing-dishes that had been lighted here and there to keep the late comers� plates from growing cold (which did not, however, prevent the dessert, in the centre of the room, from being piled on the outstretched hands of a huge mannikin, sometimes supported on the wings of a duck, apparently of crystal, but really of ice, carved afresh every day with a hot iron by a sculptor-cook, quite in the Flemish manner), I went straight � at the risk of being knocked down by his colleagues � towards this servitor, in whom I felt that I recognised a character who is traditionally present in all these sacred subjects, for he reproduced with scrupulous accuracy the blunt features, fatuous and ill-drawn, the musing expression, already half aware of the miracle of a divine presence which the others have not yet begun to suspect. I should add that, in view probably of the coming fair, this presentation was strengthened by a celestial contingent, recruited in mass, of cherubim and seraphim. A young angel musician, whose fair hair enclosed a fourteen-year-old face, was not, it was true, playing on any instrument, but stood musing before a gong or a pile of plates, while other less infantile angels flew swiftly across the boundless expanse of the room, beating the air with the ceaseless fluttering of the napkins which fell along the lines of their bodies like the wings in �primitive� paintings, with pointed ends. Fleeing those ill-defined regions, screened by a hedge of palms through which the angelic servitors looked, from a distance, as though they had floated down out of the empyrean, I explored my way to the smaller room in which Saint-Loup�s table was laid. I found there several of his friends who dined with him regularly, nobles except for one or two commoners in whom the young nobles had, in their school days, detected likely friends, and with whom they readily associated, proving thereby that they were not on principle hostile to the middle class, even though it were Republican, provided it had clean hands and went to mass. On the first of these evenings, before we sat down to dinner, I drew Saint-Loup into a corner and, in front of all the rest but so that they should not hear me, said to him:  ��� �Robert, this is hardly the time or the place for what I am going to say, but I shan�t be a second. I keep on forgetting to ask you when I�m in the barracks; isn�t that Mme. de Guermantes�s photograph that you have on your table?�  ��� �Why, yes; my good aunt.�  ��� �Of course she is; what a fool I am; you told me before that she was; I�d forgotten all about her being your aunt. I say, your friends will be getting impatient, we must be quick, they�re looking at us; another time will do; it isn�t at all important.�  ��� �That�s all right; go on as long as you like. They can wait.�  ��� �No, no; I do want to be polite to them; they�re so nice; besides, it doesn�t really matter in the least, I assure you.�  ��� �Do you know that worthy Oriane, then?�  ���This �worthy Oriane,� as he might have said, �that good Oriane,� did not imply that Saint-Loup regarded Mme. de Guermantes as especially good. In this instance the words �good,� �excellent,� �worthy� are mere reinforcements of the demonstrative �that,� indicating a person who is known to both parties and of whom the speaker does not quite know what to say to someone outside the intimate circle. The word �good� does duty as a stopgap and keeps the conversation going for a moment until the speaker has hit upon �Do you see much of her?� or �I haven�t set eyes on her for months,� or �I shall be seeing her on Tuesday,� or �She must be getting on, now, you know.�  ��� �I can�t tell you how funny it is that it should be her photograph, because we�re living in her house now, in Paris, and I�ve been hearing the most astounding things� (I should have been hard put to it to say what) �about her, which have made me immensely interested in her, only from a literary point of view, don�t you know, from a � how shall I put it � from a Balzacian point of view; but you�re so clever you can see what I mean; I don�t need to explain things to you; but we must hurry up; what on earth will your friends think of my manners?�  ��� �They will think absolutely nothing; I have told them that you are sublime, and they are a great deal more alarmed than you are.�  ��� �You are too kind. But listen, what I want to say is this: I suppose Mme. de Guermantes hasn�t any idea that I know you, has she?�  ��� �I can�t say; I haven�t seen her since the summer, because I haven�t had any leave since she�s been in town.�  ��� �What I was going to say is this: I�ve been told that she looks on me as an absolute idiot.�  ��� �That I do not believe; Oriane is not exactly an eagle, but all the same she�s by no means stupid.�  ��� �You know that, as a rule, I don�t care about your advertising the good opinion you�re kind enough to hold of me; I�m not conceited. That�s why I�m sorry you should have said flattering things about me to your friends here (we will go back to them in two seconds). But Mme. de Guermantes is different; if you could let her know � if you would even exaggerate a trifle � what you think of me, you would give me great pleasure.�  ��� �Why, of course I will, if that�s all you want me to do; it�s not very difficult; but what difference can it possibly make to you what she thinks of you? I suppose you think her no end of a joke, really; anyhow, if that�s all you want we can discuss it in front of the others or when we are by ourselves; I�m afraid of your tiring yourself if you stand talking, and it�s so inconvenient too, when we have heaps of opportunities of being alone together.�  ���It was precisely this inconvenience that had given me courage to approach Robert; the presence of the others was for me a pretext that justified my giving my remarks a curt and incoherent form, under cover of which I could more easily dissemble the falsehood of my saying to my friend that I had forgotten his connexion with the Duchess, and also did not give him time to frame � with regard to my reasons for wishing that Mme. de Guermantes should know that I was his friend, was clever, and so forth � questions which would have been all the more disturbing in that I should not have been able to answer them.  ��� �Robert, I�m surprised that a man of your intelligence should fail to understand that one doesn�t discuss the things that will give one�s friends pleasure; one does them. Now I, if you were to ask me no matter what, and indeed I only wish you would ask me to do something for you, I can assure you I shouldn�t want any explanations. I may ask you for more than I really want; I have no desire to know Mme. de Guermantes, but just to test you I ought to have said that I was anxious to dine with Mme. de Guermantes; I am sure you would never have done it.�  ��� �Not only should I have done it, I will do it.�  ��� �When?�  ��� �Next time I�m in Paris, three weeks from now, I expect.�  ��� �We shall see; I dare say she won�t want to see me, though. I can�t tell you how grateful I am.�  ��� �Not at all; it�s nothing.�  ��� �Don�t say that; it�s everything in the world, because now I can see what sort of friend you are; whether what I ask you to do is important or not, disagreeable or not, whether I am really keen about it or ask you only as a test, it makes no difference; you say you will do it, and there you shew the fmeness of your mind and heart. A stupid friend would have started a discussion.�  ���Which was exactly what he had just been doing; but perhaps I wanted to flatter his self-esteem; perhaps also I was sincere, the sole touchstone of merit seeming to me to be the extent to which a friend could be useful in respect of the one thing that seemed to me to have any importance, namely my love. Then I went on, perhaps from cunning, possibly from a genuine increase of affection inspired by gratitude, expectancy, and the copy of Mme. de Guermantes�s very features which nature had made in producing her nephew Robert: �But, I say, we mustn�t keep them waiting any longer, and I�ve mentioned only one of the two things I wanted to ask you, the less important; the other is more important to me, but I�m afraid you will never consent. Would it bore you if we were to call each other tu?�  ��� �Bore me? My dear fellow! Joy! Tears of joy! Undreamed-of happiness!�  ��� �Thank you � tu I mean; you begin first � ever so much. It is such a pleasure to me that you needn�t do anything about Mme. de Guermantes if you�d rather not, this is quite enough for me.�  ��� �I can do both.�  ��� �I say, Robert! Listen to me a minute,� I said to him later while we were at dinner. �Oh, it�s really too absurd the way our conversation is always being interrupted, I can�t think why � you remember the lady I was speaking to you about just now.�  ��� �Yes.�  ��� �You�re quite sure you know who� I mean?�  ��� �Why, what do you take me for, a village idiot?�  ��� �You wouldn�t care to give me her photograph, I suppose?�  ���had meant to ask him only for the loan of it. But when the time came to speak I felt shy, I decided that the request was indiscreet, and in order to hide my confusion I put the question more bluntly, and increased my demand, as if it had been quite natural.  ��� �No; I should have to ask her permission first,� was his answer.  ���He blushed as he spoke. I could see that he had a reservation in his mind, that he credited me also with one, that he would give only a partial service to my love, under the restraint of certain moral principles, and for this I hated him.  ���At the same time I was touched to see how differently Saint-Loup behaved towards me now that I was no longer alone with him, and that his friends formed an audience. His increased affability would have left me cold had I thought that it was deliberately assumed; but I could feel that it was spontaneous and consisted only of all that he had to say about me in my absence and refrained as a rule from saying when we were together by ourselves. In our private conversations I might certainly suspect the pleasure that he found in talking to me, but that pleasure he almost always left unexpressed. Now, at the same remarks from me which, as a rule, he enjoyed without shewing it, he watched from the corner of his eye to see whether they produced on his friends the effect on which he had counted, an effect corresponding to what he had promised them beforehand. The mother of a girl in her first season could be no more unrelaxing in her attention to her daughter�s responses and to the attitude of the public. If I had made some remark at which, alone in my company, he would merely have smiled, he was afraid that the others might not have seen the point, and put in a �What�s that?� to make me repeat what I had said, to attract attention, and turning at once to his friends and making himself automatically, by facing them with a hearty laugh, the fugleman of their laughter, presented me for the first time with the opinion that he actually held of me and must often have expressed to them. So that I caught sight of myself suddenly from without, like a person who reads his name in a newspaper or sees himself in a mirror.  ���It occurred to me, one of these evenings, to tell a mildly amusing story about Mme. Blandais, but I stopped at once, remembering that Saint-Loup knew it already, and that when I had tried to tell him it on the day following my arrival he had interrupted me with: �You told me that before, at Balbec.� I was surprised, therefore, to find him begging me to go on and assuring me that he did not know the story, and that it would amuse him immensely. �You�ve forgotten it for the moment,� I said to him, �but you�ll remember as I go on.� �No, really; I swear you�re mistaken. You�ve never told me. Do go on.� And throughout the story he fixed a feverish and enraptured gaze alternately on myself and on his friends. I realised only after I had finished, amid general laughter, that it had struck him that this story would give his friends a good idea of my wit, and that it was for this reason that he had pretended not to know it. Such is the stuff of friendship.  ���On the third evening, one of his friends, to whom I had not had an opportunity before of speaking, conversed with me at great length; and I overheard him telling Saint-Loup how much he had been enjoying himself. And indeed we sat talking together almost all evening, leaving our glasses of sauterne untouched on the table before us, isolated, sheltered from the others by the sumptuous curtains of one of those intuitive sympathies between man and man which, when they are not based upon any physical attraction, are the only kind that is altogether mysterious. Of such an enigmatic nature had seemed to me, at Balbec, that feeling which Saint-Loup had for me, which was not to be confused with the interest of our conversations, a feeling free from any material association, invisible, intangible, and yet a thing of the presence of which in himself, like a sort of inflammatory gas, he had been so far conscious as to refer to it with a smile. And yet there was perhaps something more surprising still in this sympathy born here in a single evening, like a flower that had budded and opened in a few minutes in the warmth of this little room. I could not help asking Robert when he spoke to me about Balbec whether it were really settled that he was to marry Mlle. d�Ambresac. He assured me that not only was it not settled, but there had never been any thought of such a match, he had never seen her, he did not know who she was. If at that moment I had happened to see any of the social gossipers who had told me of this coming event, they would promptly have announced the betrothal of Mlle. d�Ambresac to some one who was not Saint-Loup and that of Saint-Loup to some one who was not Mlle. d�Ambresac. I should have surprised them greatly had I reminded them of their incompatible and still so recent predictions. In order that this little game may continue, and multiply false reports by attaching the greatest possible number to every name in turn, nature has furnished those who play it with a memory as short as their credulity is long.  ���Saint-Loup had spoken to me of another of his friends who was present also one with whom he was on particularly good terms just then, since they were the only two advocates in their mess of the retrial of Dreyfus.  ���Just as a brother of this friend of Saint-Loup, who had been trained at the Schola Cantorum, thought about every new musical work not at all what his father, his mother, his cousins, his club friends thought, but exactly what the other students thought at the Schola, so this non-commissioned nobleman (of whom Bloch formed an extraordinary opinion when I told him about him, because, touched to hear that he belonged to the same party as himself, he nevertheless imagined him on account of his aristocratic birth and religious and military upbringing to be as different as possible, endowed with the same romantic attraction as a native of a distant country) had a �mentality,� as people were now beginning to say, analogous to that of the whole body of Dreyfusards in general and of Bloch in particular, on which the traditions of his family and the interests of his career could retain no hold whatever. Similarly one of Saint-Loup�s cousins had married a young Eastern princess who was said to write poetry quite as fine as Victor Hugo�s or Alfred de Vigny�s, and in spite of this was supposed to have a different type of mind from what one would naturally expect, the mind of an Eastern princess immured in an Arabian Nights palace. For the writers who had the privilege of meeting her was reserved the disappointment or rather the joy of listening to conversation which gave the impression not of Scheherazade but of a person of genius of the type of Alfred de Vigny or Victor Hugo.  ��� �That fellow? Oh, he�s not like Saint-Loup, he�s a regular devil,� my new friend informed me; �he�s not even straight about it. At first, he used to say: �Just wait a little, there�s a man I know well, a clever, kind-hearted fellow, General de Boisdeffre; you need have no hesitation in accepting his decision.� But as soon as he heard that Boisdeffre had pronounced Dreyfus guilty, Boisdeffre ceased to count: clericalism, staff prejudices, prevented his forming a candid opinion, although there is no one in the world (or was, rather, before this Dreyfus business) half so clerical as our friend. Next he told us that now we were sure to get the truth, the case had been put in the hands of Saussier, and he, a soldier of the Republic (our friend coming of an ultra-monarchist family, if you please), was a man of bronze, a stern unyielding conscience. But when Saussier pronounced Esterhazy innocent, he found fresh reasons to account for the decision, reasons damaging not to Dreyfus but to General Saussier. It was the militarist spirit that blinded Saussier (and I must explain to you that our friend is just as much militarist as clerical, or at least he was; I don�t know what to think of him now). His family are all brokenhearted at seeing him possessed by such ideas.�  ��� �Don�t you think,� I suggested, turning half towards Saint-Loup so as not to appear to be cutting myself off from him, as well as towards his friend, and so that we might all three join in the conversation, �that the influence we ascribe to environment is particularly true of intellectual environment. One is the man of one�s idea. There are far fewer ideas than men, therefore all men with similar ideas are alike. As there is nothing material in an idea, so the people who are only materially neighbours of the man with an idea can do nothing to alter it.�  ���At this point I was interrupted by Saint-Loup, because another of the young men had leaned across to him with a smile and, pointing to me, exclaimed: �Duroc! Duroc all over!� I had no idea what this might mean, but I felt the expression on the shy young face to be more than friendly. While I was speaking, the approbation of the party seemed to Saint-Loup superfluous; he insisted on silence. And just as a conductor stops his orchestra with a rap from his baton because some one in the audience has made a noise, so he rebuked the author of this disturbance: �Gibergue, you must keep your mouth shut when people are speaking. You can tell us about it afterwards.� And to me: �Please go on.�  ���I gave a sigh of relief, for I had been afraid that he was going to make me begin all over again.  ��� �And as an idea,� I went on, �is a thing that cannot participate in human interests and would be incapable of deriving any benefit from them, the men who are governed by an idea are not influenced by material considerations.�  ���When I had finished, �That�s one in the eye for you, my boys,� exclaimed Saint-Loup, who had been following me with his gaze with the same anxious solicitude as if I had been walking upon a tight-rope. �What were you going to say, Gibergue?�  ��� �I was just saying that your friend reminded me of Major Duroc. I seemed to hear him speaking.�  ��� �Why, I�ve often thought so myself,� replied Saint-Loup; �they have several points in common, but you�ll find there are a thousand things in this fellow that Duroc hasn�t got.�  ���Saint-Loup was not satisfied with this comparison. In an ecstasy of joy, into which there no doubt entered the joy that he felt in making me shine before his friends, with extreme volubility, stroking me as though he were rubbing down a horse that had just come first past the post, he reiterated: �You�re the cleverest man I know, do you hear?� He corrected himself, and added: �You and Elstir. � You don�t mind my bracketing him with you, I hope. You understand � punctiliousness. It�s like this: I say it to you as one might have said to Balzac: �You are the greatest novelist of the century � you and Stendhal.� Excessive punctiliousness, don�t you know, and at heart an immense admiration. No? You don�t admit Stendhal?� he went on, with an ingenuous confidence in my judgment which found expression in a charming, smiling, almost childish glance of interrogation from his green eyes. �Oh, good! I see you�re on my side; Bloch can�t stand Stendhal. I think it�s idiotic of him. The Chartreuse is after all an immense work, don�t you think? I am so glad you agree with me. What is it you like best in theChartreuse, answer me?� he appealed to me with a boyish impetuosity. And the menace of his physical strength made the question almost terrifying. �Mosca? Fabrice?� I answered timidly that Mosca reminded me a little of M. de Norpois. Whereupon peals of laughter from the young Siegfried Saint-Loup. And while I was going on to explain: �But Mosca is far more intelligent, not so pedantic,� I heard Robert cry: �Bravo!� actually clapping his hands, and, helpless with laughter, gasp: �Oh, perfect! Admirable! You really are astounding.�  ���I took a particular pleasure in talking to this young man, as for that matter to all Robert�s friends and to Robert himself, about their barracks, the officers of the garrison, and the army in general. Thanks to the immensely enlarged scale on which we see the things, however petty they may be, in the midst of which we eat, and talk, and lead our real life; thanks to that formidable enlargement which they undergo, and the effect of which is that the rest of the world, not being present, cannot compete with them, and assumes in comparison the unsubstantiality of a dream, I had begun to take an interest in the various personalities of the barracks, in the officers whom I saw in the square when I went to visit Saint-Loup, or, if I was awake then, when the regiment passed beneath my windows. I should have liked to know more about the major whom Saint-Loup so greatly admired, and about the course of military history which would have appealed to me �even from an aesthetic point of view.� I knew that with Robert the spoken word was, only too often, a trifle hollow, but at other times implied the assimilation of valuable ideas which he was fully capable of grasping. Unfortunately, from the military point of view Robert was exclusively preoccupied at this time with the case of Dreyfus. He spoke little about it, since he alone of the party at table was a Dreyfusard; the others were violently opposed to the idea of a fresh trial, except my other neighbour, my new friend, and his opinions appeared to be somewhat vague. A firm admirer of the colonel, who was regarded as an exceptionally competent officer and had denounced the current agitation against the Army in several of his regimental orders, which won him the reputation of being an anti-Dreyfusard, my neighbour had heard that his commanding officer had let fall certain remarks which had led to the supposition that he had his doubts as to the guilt of Dreyfus and retained his admiration for Picquart. In the latter respect, at any rate, the rumour of Dreyfusism as applied to the colonel was as ill-founded as are all the rumours, springing from none knows where, which float around any great scandal. For, shortly afterwards, this colonel having been detailed to interrogate the former Chief of the Intelligence Branch, had treated him with a brutality and contempt the like of which had never been known before. However this might be (and naturally he had not taken the liberty of going direct to the colonel for his information), my neighbour had paid Saint-Loup the compliment of telling him � in the tone in which a Catholic lady might tell a Jewish lady that her parish priest denounced the pogroms in Russia and might openly admire the generosity of certain Israelites � that their colonel was not, with regard to Dreyfusism � to a certain kind of Dreyfusism, at least � the fanatical, narrow opponent that he had been made out to be.  ��� �I am not surprised,� was Saint-Loup�s comment; �for he�s a sensible man. But in spite of that he is blinded by the prejudices of his caste, and above all by his clericalism. Now,� he turned to me, �Major Duroc, the lecturer on military history I was telling you about; there�s a man who is whole-heartedly in support of our views, or so I�m told. And I should have been surprised to hear that he wasn�t, for he�s not only a brilliantly clever man, but a Radical-Socialist and a freemason.�  ���Partly out of courtesy to his friends, whom these expressions of Saint-Loup�s faith in Dreyfus made uncomfortable, and also because the subject was of more interest to myself, I asked my neighbour if it were true that this major gave a demonstration of military history which had a genuine aesthetic beauty. �It is absolutely true.�  ��� �But what do you mean by that?�  ��� �Well, all that you read, let us say, in the narrative of a military historian, the smallest facts, the most trivial happenings, are only the outward signs of an idea which has to be analysed, and which often brings to light other ideas, like a palimpsest. So that you have a field for study as intellectual as any science you care to name, or any art, and one that is satisfying to the mind.�  ��� �Give me an example or two, if you don�t mind.�  ��� �It is not very easy to explain,� Saint-Loup broke in. �You read, let us say, that this or that Corps has tried . . . but before we go any further, the serial number of the Corps, its order of battle are not without their significance. If it is not the first time that the operation has been attempted, and if for the same operation we find a different Corps being brought up, it is perhaps a sign that the previous Corps have been wiped out or have suffered heavy casualties in the said operation; that they are no longer in a fit state to carry it through successfully. Next, we must ask ourselves what was this Corps which is now out of action; if it was composed of shock troops, held in reserve for big attacks, a fresh Corps of inferior quality will have little chance of succeeding where the first has failed. Furthermore, if we are not at the start of a campaign, this fresh Corps may itself be a composite formation of odds and ends withdrawn from other Corps, which throws a light on the strength of the forces the belligerent still has at his disposal and the proximity of the moment when his forces shall be definitely inferior to the enemy�s, which gives to the operation on which this Corps is about to engage a different meaning, because, if it is no longer in a condition to make good its losses, its successes even will only help mathematically to bring it nearer to its ultimate destruction. And then, the serial number of the Corps that it has facing it is of no less significance. If, for instance, it is a much weaker unit, which has already accounted for several important units of the attacking force, the whole nature of the operation is changed, since, even if it should end in the loss of the position which the defending force has been holding, simply to have held it for any length of time may be a great success if a very small defending force has been sufficient to disable highly important forces on the other side. You can understand that if, in the analysis of the Corps engaged on both sides, there are all these points of importance, the study of the position itself, of the roads, of the railways which it commands, of the lines of communication which it protects, is of the very highest. One must study what I may call the whole geographical context,� he added with a laugh. And indeed he was so delighted with this expression that, every time he employed it, even months afterwards, it was always accompanied by the same laugh. �While the operation is being prepared by one of the belligerents, if you read that one of his patrols has been wiped out in the neighbourhood of the position by the other belligerent, one of the conclusions which you are entitled to draw is that one side was attempting to reconnoitre the defensive works with which the other intended to resist his attack. An exceptional burst of activity at a given point may indicate the desire to capture that point, but equally well the desire to hold the enemy in check there, not to retaliate at the point at which he has attacked you; or it may indeed be only a feint, intended to cover by an increased activity the relief of troops in that sector. (Which was a classic feint in Napoleon�s wars.) On the other hand, to appreciate the significance of any movement, its probable object, and, as a corollary, the other movements by which it will be accompanied or followed, it is not immaterial to consult, not so much the announcements issued by the Higher Command, which may be intended to deceive the enemy, to mask a possible check, as the manual of field operations in use in the country in question. We are always entitled to assume that the manoeuvre which an army has attempted to carry out is that prescribed by the rules that are applicable to the circumstances. If, for instance, the rule lays down that a frontal attack should be accompanied by a flank attack; if, after the flank attack has failed, the Higher Command makes out that it had no connexion with the main attack and was merely a diversion, there is a strong likelihood that the truth will be found by consulting the rules and not the reports issued from Headquarters. And there are not only the regulations governing each army to be considered, but their traditions, their habits, their doctrines; the study of diplomatic activities, with their perpetual action or reaction upon military activities, must not be neglected either. Incidents apparently insignificant, which at the time are not understood, will explain to you how the enemy, counting upon a support which these incidents shew to have been withheld, was able to carry out only a part of his strategic plan. So that, if you can read between the lines of military history, what is a confused jumble for the ordinary reader becomes a chain of reasoning as straightforward as a picture is for the picture-lover who can see what the person portrayed is wearing and has in his hands, while the visitor hurrying through the gallery is bewildered by a blur of colour which gives him a headache. But just as with certain pictures, in which it is not enough to observe that the figure is holding a chalice, but one must know why the painter chose to place a chalice in his hands, what it is intended to symbolise, so these military operations, apart from their immediate object, are quite regularly traced, in the mind of the general responsible for the campaign, from the plans of earlier battles, which we may call the past experience, the literature, the learning, the etymology, the aristocracy (whichever you like) of the battles of to-day. Observe that I am not speaking for the moment of the local, the (what shall I call it?) spatial identity of battles. That exists also. A battle-field has never been, and never will be throughout the centuries, simply the ground upon which a particular battle has been fought. If it has been a battle-field, that was because it combined certain conditions of geographical position, of geological formation, drawbacks even, of a kind that would obstruct the enemy (a river, for instance, cutting his force in two), which made it a good field of battle. And so what it has been it will continue to be. A painter doesn�t make a studio out of any old room; so you don�t make a battle-field out of any old piece of ground. There are places set apart for the purpose. But, once again, this is not what I was telling you about; it was the type of battle which one follows, in a sort of strategic tracing, a tactical imitation, if you like. Battles like Ulm, Lodi, Leipzig, Cannae. I can�t say whether there is ever going to be another war, or what nations are going to fight in it, but, if a war does come, you may be sure that it will include (and deliberately, on the commander�s part) a Cannae, an Austerlitz, a Rosbach, a Waterloo. Some of our people say quite openly that Marshal von Schieffer and General Falkenhausen have prepared a Battle of Cannae against France, in the Hannibal style, pinning their enemy down along his whole front, and advancing on both flanks, especially through Belgium, while Bernhardi prefers the oblique order of Frederick the Great, Lenthen rather than Cannae. Others expound their views less crudely, but I can tell you one thing, my boy, that Beauconseil, the squadron commander I introduced you to the other day, who is an officer with a very great future before him, has swotted up a little Pratzen attack of his own; he knows it inside out, he is keeping it up his sleeve, and if he ever has an opportunity to put it into practice he will make a clean job of it and let us have it on a big scale. The break through in the centre at Rivoli, too; that�s a thing that will crop up if there�s ever another war. It�s no more obsolete than the Iliad. I must add that we are practically condemned to make frontal attacks, because we can�t afford to repeat the mistake we made in Seventy; we must assume the offensive, and nothing else. The only thing that troubles me is that if I see only the slower, more antiquated minds among us opposing this splendid doctrine, still, one of the youngest of my masters, who is a genius, I mean Mangin, would like us to leave room, provisionally of course, for the defensive. It is not very easy to answer him when he cites the example of Austerlitz, where the defence was merely a prelude to attack and victory.�  ���The enunciation of these theories by Saint-Loup made me happy. They gave me to hope that perhaps I was not being led astray, in my life at Donci�res, with regard to these officers whom I used to hear being discussed while I sat sipping a sauterne which bathed them in its charming golden glint, by the same magnifying power which had swollen to such enormous proportions in my eyes while I was at Balbec the King and Queen of the South Sea Island, the little group of the four epicures, the young gambler, Legrandin�s brother-in-law, now shrunken so in my view as to appear nonexistent. What gave me pleasure to-day would not, perhaps, leave me indifferent to-morrow, as had always happened hitherto; the creature that I still was at this moment was not, perhaps, doomed to immediate destruction since to the ardent and fugitive passion which I had felt on these few evenings for everything connected with military life, Saint-Loup, by what he had just been saying to me, touching the art of war, added an intellectual foundation, of a permanent character, capable of attaching me to itself so strongly that I might, without any attempt to deceive myself, feel assured that after I had left Donci�res I should continue to take an interest in the work of my friends there, and should not be long in coming to pay them another visit. At the same time, so as to make quite sure that this art of war was indeed an art in the true sense of the word:  ��� �You interest me � I beg your pardon, tu interest me enormously,� I said to Saint-Loup, �but tell me, there is one point that puzzles me. I feel that I could be keenly thrilled by the art of strategy, but if so I must first be sure that it is not so very different from the other arts, that knowing the rules is not everything. You tell me that plans of battles are copied. I do find something aesthetic, just as you said, in seeing beneath a modern battle the plan of an older one, I can�t tell you how attractive it sounds. But then, does the genius of the commander count for nothing? Does he really do no more than apply the rules? Or, in point of science, are there great generals as there are great surgeons, who, when the symptoms exhibited by two states of ill-health are identical to the outward eye, nevertheless feel, for some infinitesimal reason, founded perhaps on their experience, but interpreted afresh, that in one case they ought to do one thing, in another case another; that in one case it is better to operate, in another to wait?�  ��� �I should just say so! You will find Napoleon not attacking when all the rules ordered him to attack, but some obscure divination warned him not to. For instance, look at Austerlitz, or in 1806 take his instructions to Lannes. But you will find certain generals slavishly imitating one of Napoleon�s movements and arriving at a diametrically opposite result. There are a dozen examples of that in 1870. But even for the interpretation of what the enemy may do, what he actually does is only a symptom which may mean any number of different things. Each of them has an equal chance of being the right thing, if one looks only to reasoning and science, just as in certain difficult cases all the medical science in the world will be powerless to decide whether the invisible tumour is malignant or not, whether or not the operation ought to be performed. It is his instinct, his divination � like Mme. de Th�bes (you follow me?)� which decides, in the great general as in the great doctor. Thus I�ve been telling you, to take one instance, what might be meant by a reconnaissance on the eve of a battle. But it may mean a dozen other things also, such as to make the enemy think you are going to attack him at one point whereas you intend to attack him at another, to put out a screen which will prevent him from seeing the preparations for your real operation, to force him to bring up fresh troops, to hold them, to immobilise them in a different place from where they are needed, to form an estimate of the forces at his disposal, to feel him, to force him to shew his hand. Sometimes, indeed, the fact that you employ an immense number of troops in an operation is by no means a proof that that is your true objective; for you may be justified in carrying it out, even if it is only a feint, so that your feint may have a better chance of deceiving the enemy. If I had time now to go through the Napoleonic wars from this point of view, I assure you that these simple classic movements which we study here, and which you will come and see us practising in the field, just for the pleasure of a walk, you young rascal � no, I know you�re not well, I apologise! � well, in a war, when you feel behind you the vigilance, the judgment, the profound study of the Higher Command, you are as much moved by them as by the simple lamps of a lighthouse, only a material combustion, but an emanation of the spirit, sweeping through space to warn ships of danger. I may have been wrong, perhaps, in speaking to you only of the literature of war. In reality, as the formation of the soil, the direction of wind and light tell us which way a tree will grow, so the conditions in which a campaign is fought, the features of the country through which you march, prescribe, to a certain extent, and limit the number of the plans among which the general has to choose. Which means that along a mountain range, through a system of valleys, over certain plains, it is almost with the inevitability and the tremendous beauty of an avalanche that you can forecast the line of an army on the march.�  ��� �Now you deny me that freedom of choice in the commander, that power of divination in the enemy who is trying to discover his plan, which you allowed me a moment ago.�  ��� �Not at all. You remember that book of philosophy we read together at Balbec, the richness of the world of possibilities compared with the real world. Very well. It is the same again with the art of strategy. In a given situation there will be four plans that offer themselves, one of which the general has to choose, as a disease may pass through various phases for which the doctor has to watch. And here again the weakness and greatness of the human elements are fresh causes of uncertainty. For of these four plans let us assume that contingent reasons (such as the attainment of minor objects, or time, which may be pressing, or the smallness of his effective strength and shortage of rations) lead the general to prefer the first, which is less perfect, but less costly also to carry out, is more rapid, and has for its terrain a richer country for feeding his troops. He may, after having begun with this plan, which the enemy, uncertain at first, will soon detect, find that success lies beyond his grasp, the difficulties being too great (that is what I call the element of human weakness), abandon it and try the second or third or fourth. But it may equally be that he has tried the first plan (and this is what I call human greatness) merely as a feint to pin down the enemy, so as to surprise him later at a point where he has not been expecting an attack. Thus at Ulm, Mack, who expected the enemy to advance from the west, was surrounded from the north where he thought he was perfectly safe. My example is not a very good one, as a matter of fact. And Ulm is a better type of enveloping battle, which the future will see reproduced, because it is not only a classic example from which generals will seek inspiration, but a form that is to some extent necessary (one of several necessities, which leaves room for choice, for variety) like a type of crystallisation. But it doesn�t much matter, really, because these conditions are after all artificial. To go back to our philosophy book; it is like the rules of logic or scientific laws, reality does conform to it more or less, but bear in mind that the great mathematician Poincar� is by no means certain that mathematics are strictly accurate. As to the rules themselves, which I mentioned to you, they are of secondary importance really, and besides they are altered from time to time. We cavalrymen, for instance, have to go by the Field Service of 1895, which, you may say, is out of date since it is based on the old and obsolete doctrine which maintains that cavalry warfare has little more than a moral effect, in the panic that the charge creates in the enemy. Whereas the more intelligent of our teachers, all the best brains in the cavalry, and particularly the major I was telling you about, anticipate on the contrary that the decisive victory will be obtained by a real hand-to-hand encounter in which our weapons will be sabre and lance and the side that can hold out longer will win, not simply morally and by creating panic, but materially.�  ��� �Saint-Loup is quite right, and it is probable that the next Field Service will shew signs of this evolution,� put in my other neighbour.  ��� �I am not ungrateful for your support, for your opinions seem to make more impression upon my friend than mine,� said Saint-Loup with a smile, whether because the growing attraction between his comrade and myself annoyed him slightly or because he thought it graceful to solemnise it with this official confirmation. �Perhaps I may have underestimated the importance of the rules; I don�t know. They do change, that must be admitted. But in the meantime they control the military situation, the plans of campaign and concentration. If they reflect a false conception of strategy they may be the principal cause of defeat. All this is a little too technical for you,� he remarked to me. �After all, you may say that what does most to accelerate the evolution of the art of war is wars themselves. In the course of a campaign, if it is at all long, you will see one belligerent profiting by the lessons furnished him by the successes and mistakes, perfecting the methods of the other, who will improve on him in turn. But all that is a thing of the past. With the terrible advance of artillery, the wars of the future, if there are to be any more wars, will be so short that, before we have had time to think of putting our lessons into practice, peace will have been signed.�  ��� �Don�t be so touchy,� I told Saint-Loup, reverting to the first words ol this speech. �I was listening to you quite eagerly.�  ��� �If you will kindly not fly into a passion, and will allow me to speak,� his friend went on, �I shall add to what you have just been saying that if battles copy and coincide with one another it is not merely due to the mind of the commander. It may happen that a mistake on his part (for instance, his failure to appreciate the strength of the enemy) will lead him to call upon his men for extravagant sacrifices, sacrifices which certain units will make with an abnegation so sublime that their part in the battle will be analogous to that played by some other unit in some other battle, and these will be quoted in history as interchangeable examples: to stick to 1870, we have the Prussian Guard at Saint-Privat, and the Turcos at Froeschviller and Wissembourg.�  ��� �Ah! Interchangeable; very neat! Excellent! The lad has brains,� was Saint-Loup�s comment.  ���I was not unmoved by these last examples, as always when, beneath the particular instance, I was afforded a glimpse of the general law. Still, the genius of the commander, that was what interested me, I was anxious to discover in what it consisted, what steps, in given circumstances, when the commander who lacked genius could not withstand the enemy, the inspired leader would take to re-establish his jeopardised position, which, according to Saint-Loup, was quite possible and had been done by Napoleon more than once. And to understand what military worth meant I asked for comparisons between the various generals whom I knew by name, which of them had most markedly the character of a leader, the gifts of a tactician; at the risk of boring my new friends, who however shewed no signs of boredom, but continued to answer me with an inexhaustible good nature.  ���I felt myself isolated, not only from the great, freezing night which extended far around us and in which we heard from time to time the whistle of a train which only rendered more keen the pleasure of being where we were, or the chime of an hour which, happily, was still a long way short of that at which these young men would have to buckle on their sabres and go, but also from all my external obsessions, almost from the memory of Mme. de Guermantes, by the hospitality of Saint-Loup, to which that of his friends, reinforcing it, gave, so to speak, a greater solidity; by the warmth also of this little dining-room, by the savour of the well-chosen dishes that were set before us. They gave as much pleasure to my imagination as to my appetite; sometimes the little piece of still life from which they had been taken, the rugged holy water stoup of the oyster in which lingered a few drops of brackish water, or the knotted stem, the yellow leaves of a bunch of grapes still enveloped them, inedible, poetic and remote as a landscape, and producing, at different points in the course of the meal, the impressions of rest in the shade of a vine and of an excursion out to sea; on other evenings it was the cook alone who threw into relief these original properties of our food, which he presented in its natural setting, like a work of art; and a fish cooked in wine was brought in on a long earthenware dish, on which, as it stood out in relief on a bed of bluish herbs, unbreakable now but still contorted from having been dropped alive into boiling water, surrounded by a circle of satellite creatures in their shells, crabs, shrimps and mussels, it had the appearance of being part of a ceramic design by Bernard Palissy.  ��� �I am jealous, furious,� Saint-Loup attacked me, half smiling, half in earnest, alluding to the interminable conversations aside which I had been having with his friend. �Is it because you find him more intelligent than me; do you like him better than me? Well, I suppose he�s everything now, and no one else is to have a look in!� Men who are enormously in love with a woman, who live in the society of woman-lovers, allow themselves pleasantries on which others, who would see less innocence in them, would never venture.  ���When the conversation became general, they avoided any reference to Dreyfus for fear of offending Saint-Loup. The following week, however, two of his friends were remarking what a curious thing it was that, living in so military an atmosphere, he was so keen a Dreyfusard, almost an anti-militarist. �The reason is,� I suggested, not wishing to enter into details, �that the influence of environment is not so important as people think . . . � I intended of course to stop at this point, and not to reiterate the observations which I had made to Saint-Loup a few days earlier. Since, however, I had repeated these words almost textually, I proceeded to excuse myself by adding: �As, in fact, I was saying the other day . . . � But I had reckoned without the reverse side of Robert�s polite admiration of myself and certain other persons. That admiration reached its fulfilment in so entire an assimilation of their ideas that, in the course of a day or two, he would have completely forgotten that those ideas were not his own. And so, in the matter of my modest theory, Saint-Loup, for all the world as though it had always dwelt in his own brain, and as though I were merely poaching on his preserves, felt it incumbent upon him to greet my discovery with warm approval.  ��� �Why, yes; environment is of no importance.�  ���And with as much vehemence as if he were afraid of my interrupting, or failing to understand him:  ��� �The real influence is that of one�s intellectual environment! One is the man of one�s idea!�  ���He stopped for a moment, with the satisfied smile of one who has digested his dinner, dropped his eyeglass and, fixing me with a gimlet-like stare:  ��� �All men with similar ideas are alike,� he informed me, with a challenging air. Probably he had completely forgotten that I myself had said to him, only a few days earlier, what on the other hand he remembered so well.  ���I did not arrive at Saint-Loup�s restaurant every evening in the same state of mind. If a memory, a sorrow that weigh on us are able to leave us so effectively that we are no longer aware of them, they can also return and sometimes remain with us for a long time. There were evenings when, as I passed through the town on my way to the restaurant, I felt so keen a longing for Mme. de Guermantes that I could scarcely breathe; you might have said that part of my breast had been cut open by a skilled anatomist, taken out, and replaced by an equal part of immaterial suffering, by an equivalent load of longing and love. And however neatly the wound may have been stitched together, there is not much comfort in life when regret for the loss of another person is substituted for one�s entrails, it seems to be occupying more room than they, one feels it perpetually, and besides, what a contradiction in terms to be obliged to think a part of one�s body. Only it seems that we are worth more, somehow. At the whisper of a breeze we sigh, from oppression, but from weariness also. I would look up at the sky. If it were clear, I would say to myself: �Perhaps she is in the country; she is looking at the same stars; and, for all I know, when I arrive at the restaurant Robert may say to me: �Good news! I have just heard from my aunt; she wants to meet you; she is coming down here.�� It was not in the firmament alone that I enshrined the thought of Mme. de Guermantes, A passing breath of air, more fragrant than the rest, seemed to bring me a message from her, as, long ago, from Gilberte in the cornfields of M�s�glise. We do not change; we introduce into the feeling with which we regard a person many slumbering elements which that feeling revives but which are foreign to it. Besides, with these feelings for particular people, there is always something in us that is trying to bring them nearer to the truth, that is to say, to absorb them in a more general feeling, common to the whole of humanity, with which people and the suffering that they cause us are merely a means to enable us to communicate. What brought a certain pleasure into my grief was that I knew it to be a tiny fragment of the universal love. Simply because I thought that I recognised sorrows which I had felt on Gilberte�s account, or else when in the evenings at Combray Mamma would not stay in any room, and also the memory of certain pages of Bergotte, in the agony I now felt, to which Mme. de Guermantes, her coldness, her absence, were not clearly linked, as cause is to effect in the mind of a philosopher, I did not conclude that Mme. de Guermantes was not the cause of that agony. Is there not such a thing as a diffused bodily pain, extending, radiating out into other parts, which, however, it leaves, to vanish altogether, if the practitioner lays his finger on the precise spot from which it springs? And yet, until that moment, its extension gave it for us so vague, so fatal a semblance that, powerless to explain or even to locate it, we imagined that there was no possibility of its being healed. As I made my way to the restaurant I said to myself: �A fortnight already since I last saw Mme. de Guermantes.� A fortnight which did not appear so enormous an interval save to me, who, when Mme. de Guermantes was concerned, reckoned time by minutes. For me it was no longer the stars and the breeze merely, but the arithmetical divisions of time that assumed a dolorous and poetic aspect. Each day now was like the loose crest of a crumbling mountain, down one side of which I felt that I could descend into oblivion, but down the other was borne by the necessity of seeing the Duchess again. And I was continually inclining one way or the other, having no stable equilibrium. One day I said to myself: �Perhaps there will be a letter to-night;� and on entering the dining-room I found courage to ask Saint-Loup:  ��� �You don�t happen to have had any news from Paris?�  ��� �Yes,� he replied gloomily; �bad news.�  ���I breathed a sigh of relief when I realised that it was only he who was unhappy, and that the news came from his mistress. But I soon saw that one of its consequences would be to prevent Robert, for ever so long, from taking me to see his aunt.  ���I learned that a quarrel had broken out between him and his mistress, through the post presumably, unless she had come down to pay him a flying visit between trains. And the quarrels, even when relatively slight, which they had previously had, had always seemed as though they must prove insoluble. For she was a girl of violent temper, who would stamp her foot and burst into tears for reasons as incomprehensible as those that make children shut themselves into dark cupboards, not come out for dinner, refuse to give any explanation, and only redouble their sobs when, our patience exhausted, we visit them with a whipping. To say that Saint-Loup suffered terribly from this estrangement would be an understatement of the truth, which would give the reader a false impression of his grief. When he found himself alone, the only picture in his mind being that of his mistress parting from him with the respect which she had felt for him at the sight of his energy, the anxieties which he had had at first gave way before the irreparable, and the cessation of an anxiety is so pleasant a thing that the rupture, once it was certain, assumed for him something of the same kind of charm as a reconciliation. What he began to suffer from, a little later, was a secondary and accidental grief, the tide of which flowed incessantly from his own heart, at the idea that perhaps she would be glad to make it up, that it was not inconceivable that she was waiting for a word from him, that in the mean time, to be avenged on him, she would perhaps on a certain evening, in a certain place, do a certain thing, and that he had only to telegraph to her that he was coming for it not to happen, that others perhaps were taking advantage of the time which he was letting slip, and that in a few days it would be too late to recapture her, for she would be already bespoke. Among all these possibilities he was certain of nothing; his mistress preserved a silence which wrought him up to such a frenzy of grief that he began to ask himself whether she might not be in hiding at Donci�res, or have sailed for the Indies.  ���It has been said that silence is a force; in another and widely different sense it is a tremendous force in the hands of those who are loved. It increases the anxiety of the lover who has to wait. Nothing so tempts us to approach another person as what is keeping us apart; and what barrier is there so insurmountable as silence? It has been said also that silence is a torture, capable of goading to madness him who is condemned to it in a prison cell. But what a torture � keener than that of having to keep silence � to have to endure the silence of the person one loves! Robert asked himself: �What can she be doing, never to send me a single word, like this? She hates me, perhaps, and will always go on hating me.� And he reproached himself. Thus her silence did indeed drive him mad with jealousy and remorse. Besides, more cruel than the silence of prisons, that kind of silence is in itself a prison. An immaterial enclosure, I admit, but impenetrable, this interposed slice of empty atmosphere through which, despite its emptiness, the visual rays of the abandoned lover cannot pass. Is there a more terrible illumination than that of silence which shews us not one absent love but a thousand, and shews us each of them in the act of indulging in some fresh betrayal? Sometimes, in an abrupt relaxation of his strain, Robert would imagine that this period of silence was just coming to an end, that the long expected letter was on its way. He saw it, it arrived, he started at every sound, his thirst was already quenched, he murmured: �The letter! The letter!� After this glimpse of a phantom oasis of affection, he found himself once more toiling across the real desert of a silence without end.  ���He suffered in anticipation, without a single omission, all the griefs and pains of a rupture which at other moments he fancied he might somehow contrive to avoid, like people who put all their affairs in order with a view to a migration abroad which they never make, whose minds, no longer certain where they will find themselves living next day, flutter helplessly for the time being, detached from them, like a heart that is taken out of a dying man and continues to beat, though disjoined from the rest of his body. Anyhow, this hope that his mistress would return gave him courage to persevere in the rupture, as the belief that one will return alive from the battle helps one to face death. And inasmuch as habit is, of all the plants of human growth, the one that has least need of nutritious soil in order to live, and is the first to appear upon what is apparently the most barren rock, perhaps had he begun by effecting their rupture as a feint he would in the end have grown genuinely accustomed to it. But his uncertainty kept him in a state of emotion which, linked with the memory of the woman herself, was akin to love. He forced himself, nevertheless, not to write to her, thinking perhaps that it was a less cruel torment to live without his mistress than with her in certain conditions, or else that, after the way in which they had parted, it was necessary to wait for excuses from her, if she was to keep what he believed her to feel for him in the way, if not of love, at any rate of esteem and regard. He contented himself with going to the telephone, which had recently been installed at Donci�res, and asking for news from, or giving instructions to a lady�s maid whom he had procured and placed with his friend. These communications were, as it turned out, complicated and took up much of his time, since, influenced by what her literary friends preached to her about the ugliness of the capital, but principally for the sake of her animals, her dogs, her monkey, her canaries and her parrokeet, whose incessant din her Paris landlord had declined to tolerate for another moment, Robert�s mistress had now taken a little house in the neighbourhood of Versailles. Meanwhile he, down at Donci�res, no longer slept a wink all night. Once, in my room, overcome by exhaustion, he dozed off for a little. But suddenly he began to talk, tried to get up and run, to stop something from happening, said: �I hear her; you shan�t . . . you shan�t. . . . � He awoke. He had been dreaming, he explained to me, that he was in the country with the serjeant-major. His host had tried to keep him away from a certain part of the house. Saint-Loup had discovered that the serjeant-major had staying with him a subaltern, extremely rich and extremely vicious, whom he knew to have a violent passion for his mistress. And suddenly in his dream he had distinctly heard the spasmodic, regular cries which his mistress was in the habit of uttering at the moment of gratification. He had tried to force the serjeant-major to take him to the room in which she was. And the other had held him back, to keep him from going there, with an air of annoyance at such a want of discretion in a guest which, Robert said, he would never be able to forget.  ��� �It was an idiotic dream,� he concluded, still quite breathless.  ���All the same I could see that, during the hour that followed, he was more than once on the point of telephoning to his mistress to beg for a reconciliation. My father had now had the telephone for some time at home, but I doubt whether that would have been of much use to Saint-Loup. Besides, it hardly seemed to me quite proper to make my parents, or even a mechanical instrument installed in their house, play pander between Saint-Loup and his mistress, ladylike and high-minded as the latter might be. His bad dream began to fade from his memory. With a fixed and absent stare, he came to see me on each of those cruel days which traced in my mind as they followed one after the other the splendid sweep of a staircase forged in hard metal on which Robert stood asking himself what decision his friend was going to take.  ���At length she wrote to ask whether he would consent to forgive her. As soon as he realised that a definite rupture had been avoided he saw all the disadvantages of a reconciliation. Besides, he had already begun to suffer less acutely, and had almost accepted a grief the sharp tooth of which he would have, in a few months perhaps, to feel again if their intimacy were to be resumed. He did not hesitate for long. And perhaps he hesitated only because he was now certain of being able to recapture his mistress, of being able to do it and therefore of doing it. Only she asked him, so that she might have time to recover her equanimity, not to come to Paris at the New Year. Now he had not the heart to go to Paris without seeing her. On the other hand, she had declared her willingness to go abroad with him, bot for that he would need to make a formal application for leave, which Captain de Borodino was unwilling to grant.  ��� �I�m sorry about it, because of your meeting with my aunt, which will have to be put off. I dare say I shall be in Paris at Easter.�  ��� �We shan�t be able to call on Mme. de Guermantes then, because I shall have gone to Balbec. But, really, it doesn�t matter in the least, I assure you.�  ��� �To Balbec? But you didn�t go there till August.�  ��� �I know; but next year they�re making me go there earlier, for my health.�  ���All that he feared was that I might form a bad impression of his mistress, after what he had told me. �She is violent simply because she is too frank, too thorough in her feelings. But she is a sublime creature. You can�t imagine what exquisite poetry there is in her. She goes every year to spend all Souls� Day at Bruges. �Nice� of her, don�t you think? If you ever do meet her you�ll see what I mean; she has a greatness. . . . � And, as he was infected with certain of the mannerisms used in the literary circles in which the lady moved: �There is something sidereal about her, in fact something bardic; you know what I mean, the poet merging into the priest.�  ���I was searching all through dinner for a pretext which would enable Saint-Loup to ask his aunt to see me without my having to wait until he came to Paris. Now such a pretext was furnished by the desire that I had to see some more pictures by Elstir, the famous painter whom Saint-Loup and I had met at Balbec. A pretext behind which there was, moreover, an element of truth, for if, on my visits to Elstir, what I had asked of his painting had been that it should lead me to the comprehension and love of things better than itself, a real thaw, an authentic square in a country town, live women on a beach (all the more would I have commissioned from it the portraits of the realities which I had not been able to fathom, such as a lane of hawthorn-blossoms, not so much that it might perpetuate their beauty for me as that it might reveal that beauty to me), now, on the other hand, it was the originality, the seductive attraction of those paintings that aroused my desire, and what I wanted above anything else was to look at other pictures by Elstir.  ���It seemed to me, also, that the least of his pictures were something quite different from the masterpieces even of greater painters than himself. His work was like a realm apart, whose frontiers were not to be passed, matchless in substance. Eagerly collecting the infrequent periodicals in which articles on him and his work had appeared, I had learned that it was only recently that he had begun to paint landscapes and still life, and that he had started with mythological subjects (I had seen photographs of two of these in his studio), and had then been for long under the influence of Japanese art.  ���Several of the works most characteristic of his various manners were scattered about the provinces. A certain house at les Andelys, in which there was one of his finest landscapes, seemed to me as precious, gave me as keen a desire to go there and see it as did a village in the Chartres district, among whose millstone walls was enshrined a glorious painted window; and towards the possessor of this treasure, towards the man who, inside his ugly house, on the main Street, closeted like an astrologer, sat questioning one of those mirrors of the world which Elstir�s pictures were, and who had perhaps bought it for many thousands of francs, I felt myself borne by that instinctive sympathy which joins the very hearts, the inmost natures of those who think alike upon a vital subject. Now three important works by my favourite painter were described in one of these articles as belonging to Mme. de Guermantes. So that it was, after all, quite sincerely that, on the evening on which Saint-Loup told me of his lady�s projected visit to Bruges, I was able, during dinner, in front of his friends, to let fall, as though on the spur of the moment:  ��� �Listen, if you don�t mind. Just one last word on the subject of the lady we were speaking about. You remember Elstir, the painter I met at Balbec?�  ��� �Why, of course I do.�  ��� �You remember how much I admired his work?�  ��� �I do, quite well; and the letter we sent him.�  ��� �Very well, one of the reasons � not one of the chief reasons, a subordinate reason � why I should like to meet the said lady � you do know who� I mean, don�t you?�  ��� �Of course I do. How involved you�re getting.�  ��� �Is that she has in her house one very fine picture, at least, by Elstir.�  ��� �I say, I never knew that.�  ��� �Elstir will probably be at Balbec at Easter; you know he stays down there now all the year round, practically. I should very much like to have seen this picture before I leave Paris. I don�t know whether you�re on sufficiently intimate terms with your aunt: but couldn�t you manage, somehow, to give her so good an impression of me that she won�t refuse, and then ask her if she�ll let me come and see the picture without you, since you won�t be there?�  ��� �That�s all right. I�ll answer for her; I�ll make a special point of it.�  ��� �Oh, Robert, you are an angel; I do love you.�  ��� �It�s very nice of you to love me, but it would be equally nice if you were to call me tu, as you promised, and as you began to do.�  ��� �I hope it�s not your departure that you two are plotting together,� one of Robert�s friends said to me. �You know, if Saint-Loup does go on leave, it needn�t make any difference, we shall still be here. It will be less amusing for you, perhaps, but we�ll do all we can to make you forget his absence.� As a matter of fact, just as we had decided that Robert�s mistress would have to go to Bruges by herself, the news came that Captain de Borodino, obdurate hitherto in his refusal, had given authority for Serjeant Saint-Loup to proceed on long leave to Bruges. What had happened was this. The Prince, extremely proud of his luxuriant head of hair, was an assiduous customer of the principal hairdresser in the town, who had started life as a boy under Napoleon III�s barber. Captain de Borodino was on the best of terms with the hairdresser, being, in spite of his air of majesty, quite simple in his dealings with his inferiors. But the hairdresser, through whose books the Prince�s account had been running without payment for at least five years, swollen no less by bottles of Portugal and Eau des Souverains, irons, razors, and strops, than by the ordinary charges for shampooing, haircutting and the like, had a greater respect for Saint-Loup, who always paid on the nail and kept several carriages and saddle-horses. Having learned of Saint-Loup�s vexation at not being able to go with his mistress, he had spoken strongly about it to the Prince at a moment when he was trussed up in a white surplice with his head held firmly over the back of the chair and his throat menaced by a razor. This narrative of a young man�s gallant adventures won from the princely captain a smile of Bonapartish indulgence. It is hardly probable that he thought of his unpaid bill, but the barber�s recommendation tended to put him in as good a humour as one from a duke would have put him in a bad. While his chin was still smothered in soap, the leave was promised, and the warrant was signed that evening. As for the hairdresser, who was in the habit of boasting all day long of his own exploits, and in order to do so claimed for himself, shewing an astonishing faculty for lying, distinctions that were pure fabrications, having for once rendered this signal service to Saint-Loup, not only did he refrain from publishing it broadcast, but, as if vanity were obliged to lie, and when there was no scope for lying gave place to modesty, he never mentioned the matter to Robert again.  ���All his friends assured me that, as long as I stayed at Donci�res, or if I should come there again at any time, even although Robert were away, their horses, their quarters, their time would be at my disposal, and I felt that it was with the greatest cordiality that these young men put their comfort and youth and strength at the service of my weakness.  ��� �Why on earth,� they went on, after insisting that I should stay, �don�t you come down here every year; you see how our quiet life appeals to you! Besides you�re so keen about everything that goes on in the regiment; quite the old soldier.�  ���For I continued my eager demands that they would classify the different officers whose names I knew according to the degree of admiration which they seemed to deserve, just as, in my schooldays, I used to make the other boys classify the actors of the Th��tre-Fran�ais. If, in the place of one of the generals whom I had always heard mentioned at the head of the list, such as Galliffet or N�grier, one of Saint-Loup�s friends, with a contemptuous: �But N�grier is one of the feeblest of our general officers,� put the new, intact, appetising name of Pau or Geslin de Bourgogne, I felt the same joyful surprise as long ago when the outworn name of Thiron or Febvre was sent flying by the sudden explosion of the unfamiliar name of Amaury. �Better even than N�grier? But in what respect; give me an example?� I should have liked there to exist profound differences even among the junior officers of the regiment, and I hoped in the reason for these differences to seize the essential quality of what constituted military superiority. The one whom I should have been most interested to hear discussed, because he was the one whom I had most often seen, was the Prince de Borodino. But neither Saint-Loup nor his friends, if they did justice to the fine officer who kept his squadron up to the supreme pitch of efficiency, liked the man. Without speaking of him, naturally, in the same tone as of certain other officers, rankers and freemasons, who did not associate much with the rest and had, in comparison, an uncouth, barrack-room manner, they seemed not to include M. de Borodino among the officers of noble birth, from whom, it must be admitted, he differed considerably in his attitude even towards Saint-Loup. The others, taking advantage of the fact that Robert was only an N.C.O., and that therefore his influential relatives might be grateful were he invited to the houses of superior officers on whom ordinarily they would have looked down, lost no opportunity of having him to dine when any bigwig was expected who might be of use to a young cavalry serjeant. Captain de Borodino alone confined himself to his official relations (which, for that matter, were always excellent) with Robert. The fact was that the Prince, whose grandfather had been made a Marshal and a Prince-Duke by the Emperor, with whose family he had subsequently allied himself by marriage, while his father had married a cousin of Napoleon III and had twice been a Minister after the Coup d�Etat, felt that in spite of all this he did not count for much with Saint-Loup and the Guermantes connexion, who in turn, since he did not look at things from the same point of view as they, counted for very little with him. He suspected that, for Saint-Loup, he himself was � he, a kinsman of the Hohenzollern � not a true noble but the grandson of a farmer, but at the same time he regarded Saint-Loup as the son of a man whose Countship had been confirmed by the Emperor � one of what were known in the Faubourg Saint-Germain as �touched-up� Counts � and who had besought him first for a Prefecture, then for some other post a long way down the list of subordinates to His Highness the Prince de Borodino, Minister of State, who was styled on his letters �Monseigneur� and was a nephew of the Sovereign.  ���Something more than a nephew, possibly. The first Princesse de Borodino was reputed to have bestowed her favours on Napoleon I, whom she followed to the Isle of Elba, and the second hers on Napoleon III. And if, in the Captain�s placid countenance, one caught a trace of Napoleon I� if not in his natural features, at least in the studied majesty of the mask � the officer had, particularly in his melancholy and kindly gaze, in his drooping moustache, something that reminded one also of Napoleon III; and this in so striking a fashion that, having asked leave, after Sedan, to join the Emperor in captivity, and having been sent away by Bismarck, before whom he had been brought, the latter, happening to look up at the young man who was preparing to leave the room, was at once impressed by the likeness and, reconsidering his decision, recalled him and gave him the authorisation which he, in common with every one else, had just been refused.  ���If the Prince de Borodino was not prepared to make overtures to Saint-Loup nor to the other representatives of Faubourg Saint-Germain society that there were in the regiment (while he frequently invited two subalterns of plebeian origin who were pleasant companions) it was because, looking down upon them all from the height of his Imperial grandeur, he drew between these two classes of inferiors the distinction that one set consisted of inferiors who knew themselves to be such and with whom he was delighted to spend his time, being beneath his outward majesty of a simple, jovial humour, and the other of inferiors who thought themselves his superiors, a claim which he could not allow. And so, while all the other officers of the regiment made much of Saint-Loup, the Prince de Borodino, to whose care the young man had been recommended by Marshal X� � confined himself to being obliging with regard to the military duties which Saint-Loup always performed in the most exemplary fashion, but never had him to his house except on one special occasion when he found himself practically compelled to invite him, and when, as this occurred during my stay at Donci�res, he asked him to bring me to dinner also. I had no difficulty that evening, as I watched Saint-Loup sitting at his Captain�s table, in distinguishing, in their respective manners and refinements, the difference that existed between the two aristocracies: the old nobility and that of the Empire. The offspring of a caste the faults of which, even if he repudiated them with all the force of his intellect, had been absorbed into his blood, a caste which, having ceased to exert any real authority for at least a century, saw nothing more now in the protective affability which formed part of its regular course of education, than an exercise, like horsemanship or fencing, cultivated without any serious purpose, as a sport; on meeting representatives of that middle class on which the old nobility so far looked down as to believe that they were nattered by its intimacy and would be honoured by the informality of its tone, Saint-Loup would take the hand of no matter who might be introduced to him, though he had failed perhaps to catch the stranger�s name, in a friendly grip, and as he talked to him (crossing and uncrossing his legs all the time, flinging himself back in his chair in an attitude of absolute unconstraint, one foot in the palm of his hand) call him �my dear fellow.� Belonging o the other hand to a nobility whose titles still preserved their original meaning, provided that their holders still possessed the splendid emoluments given in reward for glorious services and bringing to mind the record of high offices in which one is in command of numberless men and must know how to deal with men, the Prince de Borodino � not perhaps very distinctly or with any clear personal sense of superiority, but at any rate in his body, which revealed it by its attitudes and behaviour generally � regarded his own rank as a prerogative that was still effective; those same commoners whom Saint-Loup would have slapped on the shoulder and taken by the arm he addressed with a majestic affability, in which a reserve instinct with grandeur tempered the smiling good-fellowship that came naturally to him, in a tone marked at once by a genuine kindliness and a stiffness deliberately assumed. This was due, no doubt, to his being not so far removed from the great Embassies, and the Court itself, at which his father had held the highest posts, whereas the manners of Saint-Loup, the elbow on the table, the foot in the hand, would not have been well received there; but principally it was due to the fact that he looked down less upon the middle classes because they were the inexhaustible source from which the first Emperor had chosen his marshals and his nobles and in which the second had found a Rouher and a Fould.  ���Son, doubtless, or grandson of an Emperor, who had nothing more important to do than to command a squadron, the preoccupations of his putative father and grandfather could not, for want of an object on which to fasten themselves, survive in any real sense in the mind of M. de Borodino. But as the spirit of an artist continues to model, for many years after he is dead, the statue which he carved, so they had taken shape in him, were materialised, incarnate in him, it was they that his face reflected. It was with, in his voice, the vivacity of the first Emperor that he worded a reprimand to a corporal, with the dreamy melancholy of the second that he puffed out the smoke of a cigarette. When he passed in plain clothes through the streets of Donci�res, a certain sparkle in his eyes escaping from under the brim of the bowler hat sent radiating round this captain of cavalry a regal incognito; people trembled when he strode into the serjeant-major�s office, followed by the adjutant and the quartermaster, as though by Berthier and Mass�na. When he chose the cloth for his squadron�s breeches, he fastened on the master-tailor a gaze capable of baffling Talleyrand and deceiving Alexander; and at times, in the middle of an inspection, he would stop, let his handsome blue eyes cloud with dreams, twist his moustache, with the air of one building up a new Prussia and a new Italy. But a moment later, reverting from Napoleon III to Napoleon I, he would point out that the equipment was not properly polished, and would insist on tasting the men�s rations. And at home, in his private life, it was for the wives of middle class officers (provided that their husbands were not freemasons) that he would bring out not only a dinner service of royal blue S�vres, fit for an Ambassador (which had been given to his father by Napoleon, and appeared even more priceless in the commonplace house on a provincial street in which he was living, like those rare porcelains which tourists admire with a special delight in the rustic china-cupboard of some old manor that has been converted into a comfortable and prosperous farmhouse), but other gifts of the Emperor also: those noble and charming manners, which too would have won admiration in some diplomatic post abroad, if, for some men, it did not mean a lifelong condemnation to the most unjust form of ostracism, merely to be well born; his easy gestures, his kindness, his grace, and, embedding beneath an enamel that was of royal blue, also glorious images, the mysterious, illuminated, living reliquary of his gaze. And, in treating of the social relations with the middle classes which the Prince had at Donci�res, it may be as well to add these few words. The lieutenant-colonel played the piano beautifully; the senior medical officer�s wife sang like a Conservatoire medallist. This latter couple, as well as the lieutenant-colonel and his wife, used to dine every week with M. de Borodino. They were flattered, unquestionably, knowing that when the Prince went to Paris on leave he dined with Mme. de Pourtal�s, and the Murats, and people like that. �But,� they said to themselves, �he�s just a captain, after all; he�s only too glad to get us to come. Still, he�s a real friend, you know.� But when M. de Borodino, who had long been pulling every possible wire to secure an appointment for himself nearer Paris, was posted to Beauvais, he packed up and went, and forgot as completely the two musical couples as he forgot the Donci�res theatre and the little restaurant to which he used often to send out for his luncheon, and, to their great indignation, neither the lieutenant-colonel nor the senior medical officer, who had so often sat at his table, ever had so much as a single word from him for the rest of their lives. One morning, Saint-Loup confessed to me that he had written to my grandmother to give her news of me, with the suggestion that, since there was telephonic connexion between Paris and Donci�res, she might make use of it to speak to me. In short, that very day she was to give me a call, and he advised me to be at the post office at about a quarter to four. The telephone was not yet at that date as commonly in use as it is to-day. And yet habit requires so short a time to divest of their mystery the sacred forces with which we are in contact, that, not having had my call at once, the only thought in my mind was that it was very slow, and badly managed, and I almost decided to lodge a complaint. Like all of us nowadays I found not rapid enough for my liking in its abrupt changes the admirable sorcery for which a few moments are enough to bring before us, invisible but present, the person to whom we have been wishing to speak, and who, while still sitting at his table, in the town in which he lives (in my grandmother�s case, Paris), under another sky than ours, in weather that is not necessarily the same, in the midst of circumstances and worries of which we know nothing, but of which he is going to inform us, finds himself suddenly transported hundreds of miles (he and all the surroundings in which he remains immured) within reach of our ear, at the precise moment which our fancy has ordained. And we are like the person in the fairy-tale to whom a sorceress, on his uttering the wish, makes appear with supernatural clearness his grandmother or his betrothed in the act of turning over a book, of shedding tears, of gathering flowers, quite close to the spectator and yet ever so remote, in the place in which she actually is at the moment. We need only, so that the miracle may be accomplished, apply our lips to the magic orifice and invoke � occasionally for rather longer than seems to us necessary, I admit � the Vigilant Virgins to whose voices we listen every day without ever coming to know their faces, and who are our Guardian Angels in the dizzy realm of darkness whose portals they so jealously keep; the All Powerful by whose intervention the absent rise up at our side, without our being permitted to set eyes on them; the Danaids of the Unseen who without ceasing empty, fill, transmit the urns of sound; the ironic Furies who, just as we were murmuring a confidence to a friend, in the hope that no one was listening, cry brutally: �I hear you!�; the ever infuriated servants of the Mystery, the umbrageous priestesses of the Invisible, the Young Ladies of the Telephone.  ���And, the moment our call has sounded, in the night filled with phantoms to which our ears alone are unsealed, a tiny sound, an abstract sound � the sound of distance overcome � and the voice of the dear one speaks to us.  ���It is she, it is her voice that is speaking, that is there. But how remote it is! How often have I been unable to listen without anguish, as though, confronted by the impossibility of seeing, except after long hours of journeying, her whose voice has been so close to my ear, I felt more clearly the sham and illusion of meetings apparently most pleasant, and at what a distance we may be from the people we love at the moment when it seems that we have only to stretch out our hand to seize and hold them. A real presence indeed that voice so near � in actual separation. But a premonition also of an eternal separation! Over and again, as I listened in this way, without seeing her who spoke to me from so far away, it has seemed to me that the voice was crying to me from depths out of which one does not rise again, and I have known the anxiety that was one day to wring my heart when a voice should thus return (alone, and attached no longer to a body which I was never more to see), to murmur, in my ear, words I would fain have kissed as they issued from lips for ever turned to dust.  ���This afternoon, alas, at Donci�res, the miracle did not occur. When I reached the post office, my grandmother�s call had already been received; I stepped into the box; the line was engaged; some one was talking who probably did not realise that there was nobody to answer him, for when I raised the receiver to my ear, the lifeless block began squeaking like Punchinello; I silenced it, as one silences a puppet, by putting it back on its hook, but, like Punchinello, as soon as I took it again in my hand, it resumed its gabbling. At length, giving it up as hopeless, by hanging up the receiver once and for all, I stifled the convulsions of this vociferous stump which kept up its chatter until the last moment, and went in search of the operator, who told me to wait a little; then I spoke, and, after a few seconds of silence, suddenly I heard that voice which I supposed myself, mistakenly, to know so well; for always until then, every time that my grandmother had talked to me, I had been accustomed to follow what she was saying on the open score of her face, in which the eyes figured so largely; but her voice itself I was hearing this afternoon for the first time. And because that voice appeared to me to have altered in its proportions from the moment that it was a whole, and reached me in this way alone and without the accompaniment of her face and features, I discovered for the first time how sweet that voice was; perhaps, too, it had never oeen so sweet, for my grandmother, knowing me to be alone and unhappy, felt that she might let herself go in the outpouring of an affection which, on her principle of education, she usually restrained and kept hidden. It was sweet, but also how sad it was, first of all on account of its very sweetness, a sweetness drained almost � more than any but a few human voices can ever have been � of every element of resistance to others, of all selfishness; fragile by reason of its delicacy it seemed at every moment ready to break, to expire in a pure flow of tears; then, too, having it alone beside me, seen, without the mask of her face, I noticed for the first time the sorrows that had scarred it in the course of a lifetime.  ���Was it, however, solely the voice that, because it was alone, gave me this new impression which tore my heart? Not at all; it was rather that this isolation of the voice was like a symbol, a presentation, a direct consequence of another isolation, that of my grandmother, separated, for the first time in my life, from myself. The orders or prohibitions which she addressed to me at every moment in the ordinary course of my life, the tedium of obedience or the fire of rebellion which neutralised the affection that I felt for her were at this moment eliminated, and indeed might be eliminated for ever (since my grandmother no longer insisted on having me with her under her control, was in the act of expressing her hope that I would stay at Donci�res altogether, or would at any rate extend my visit for as long as possible, seeing that both my health and my work seemed likely to benefit by the change); also, what I held compressed in this little bell that was ringing in my ear was, freed from the conflicting pressures which had, every day hitherto, given it a counterpoise, and from this moment irresistible, carrying me altogether away, our mutual affection. My grandmother, by telling me to stay, filled me with an anxious, an insensate longing to return. This freedom of action which for the future she allowed me and to which I had never dreamed that she would consent, appeared to me suddenly as sad as might be my freedom of action after her death (when I should still love her and she would for ever have abandoned me). �Granny!� I cried to her, �Granny!� and would fain have kissed her, but I had beside me only that voice, a phantom, as impalpable as that which would come perhaps to revisit me when my grandmother was dead. �Speak to me!� but then it happened that, left more solitary still, I ceased to catch the sound of her voice. My grandmother could no longer hear me; she was no longer in communication with me; we had ceased to stand face to face, to be audible to one another; I continued to call her, sounding the empty night, in which I felt that her appeals also must be straying. I was shaken by the same anguish which, in the distant past, I had felt once before, one day when, a little child, in a crowd, I had lost her, an anguish due less to my not finding her than to the thought that she must be searching for me, must be saying to herself that I was searching for her; an anguish comparable to that which I was to feel on the day when we speak to those who can no longer reply and whom we would so love to have hear all the things that we have not told them, and our assurance that we are not unhappy. It seemed as though it were already a beloved ghost that I had allowed to lose herself in the ghostly world, and, standing alone before the instrument, I went on vainly repeating: �Granny, Granny!� as Orpheus, left alone, repeats the name of his dead wife, is decided to leave the post office, to go and find Robert at his restaurant, in order to tell him that, as I was half expecting a telegram which would oblige me to return to Paris, I wished at all costs to find out at what times the trains left. And yet, before reaching this decision, I felt I must make one attempt more to invoke the Daughters of the Night, the Messengers of the Word, the Deities without form or feature; but the capricious Guardians had not deigned once again to unclose the miraculous portals, or more probably, had not been able; in vain might they untiringly appeal, as was their custom, to the venerable inventor of printing and the young prince, collector of impressionist paintings and driver of motor-cars (who was Captain de Borodino�s nephew); Gutenberg and Wagram left their supplications unanswered, and I came away, feeling that the Invisible would continue to turn a deaf ear.  ���When I came among Robert and his friends, I withheld the confession that my heart was no longer with them, that my departure was now irrevocably fixed. Saint-Loup appeared to believe me, but I learned afterwards that he had from the first moment realised that my uncertainty was feigned and that he would not see me again next day. And while, letting their plates grow cold, his friends joined him in searching through the time-table for a train which would take me to Paris, and while we heard in the cold, starry night the whistling of the engines on the line, I certainly felt no longer the same peace of mind which on all these last evenings I had derived from the friendship of the former and the latter�s distant passage. And yet they did not fail me this evening, performing the same office in a different way. My departure overpowered me less when I was no longer obliged to think of it by myself, when I felt that there was concentrated on what was to be done the more normal, more wholesome activity of my strenuous friends, Robert�s brothers in arms, and of those other strong creatures, the trains, whose going and coming, night and morning, between Donci�res and Paris, broke up in retrospect what had been too compact and insupportable in my long isolation from my grandmother into daily possibilities of return.  ��� �I don�t doubt the truth of what you�re saying, or that you aren�t thinking of leaving us just yet,� said Saint-Loup, smiling; �but pretend you are going, and come and say good-bye to me to-morrow morning; early, otherwise there�s a risk of my not seeing you; I�m going out to luncheon, I�ve got leave from the Captain; I shall have to be back in barracks by two, as we are to be on the march all afternoon. I suppose the man to whose house I�m going, a couple of miles out, will manage to get me back in time.�  ���Scarcely had he uttered these words when a messenger came for me from my hotel; the telephone operator had sent to find me. I ran to the post office, for it was nearly closing time. The word �trunks� recurred incessantly in the answers given me by the officiais. I was in a fever of anxiety, for it was my grandmother who had asked for me. The office was closing for the night. Finally I got my connexion. �Is that you, Granny?� A woman�s voice, with a strong English accent, answered: �Yes, but I don�t know your voice.� Neither did I recognise the voice that was speaking to me; besides, my grandmother called me tu, and not vous. And then all was explained. The young man for whom his grandmother had called on the telephone had a name almost identical with my own, and was staying in an annex of my hotel. This call coming on the very day on which I had been telephoning to my grandmother, I had never for a moment doubted that it was she who was asking for me. Whereas it was by pure coincidence that the post office and the hotel had combined to make a twofold error.  ���The following morning I rose late, and failed to catch Saint-Loup, who had already started for the country house where he was invited to luncheon. About half past one, I had decided to go in any case to the barracks, so as to be there before he arrived, when, as I was crossing one of the avenues on the way there, I noticed, coming behind me in the same direction as myself, a tilbury which, as it overtook me, obliged me to jump out of its way; an N.C.O. was driving it, wearing an eyeglass; it was Saint-Loup. By his side was the friend whose guest he had been at luncheon, and whom I had met once before at the hotel where we dined. I did not dare shout to Robert since he was not alone, but, in the hope that he would stop and pick me up, I attracted his attention by a sweeping wave of my hat, which might be regarded as due to the presence of a stranger. I knew that Robert was short-sighted; still, I should have supposed that, provided he saw me at all, he could not fail to recognise me; he did indeed see my salute, and returned it, but without stopping; driving on at full speed, without a smile, without moving a muscle of his face, he confined himself to keeping his hand raised for a minute to the peak of his cap, as though he were acknowledging the salute of a trooper whom he did not know personally. I ran to the barracks, but it was a long way; when I arrived, the regiment was parading on the square, on which I was not allowed to stand, and I was heart-broken at not having been able to say good-bye to Saint-Loup; I went up to his room, but he had gone; I was reduced to questioning a group of sick details, recruits who had been excused route-marches, the young graduate, one of the �old soldiers,� who were watching the regiment parade.  ��� �You haven�t seen Serjeant Saint-Loup, have you, by any chance?� I asked.  ��� �He�s gone on parade, sir,� said the old soldier.  ��� �I never saw him,� said the graduate.  ��� �You never saw him,� exclaimed the old soldier, losing all interest in me, �you never saw our famous Saint-Loup, the figure he�s cutting with his new breeches! When the Capstan sees that, officer�s cloth, my word!�  ��� �Oh, you�re a wonder, you are; officer�s cloth,� replied the young graduate, who, reported �sick in quarters,� was excused marching and tried, not without some misgivings, to be on easy terms with the veterans. �This officer�s cloth you speak of is cloth like that, is it?�  ��� �Sir?� asked the old soldier angrily.  ���He was indignant that the young graduate should throw doubt on the breeches� being made of officer�s cloth, but, being a Breton, coming from a village that went by the name of Penguern-Stereden, having learned French with as much difficulty as if it had been English or German, whenever he felt himself overcome by emotion he would go on saying �Sir?� to give himself time to find words, then, after this preparation, let loose his eloquence, confining himself to the repetition of certain words which he knew better than others, but without haste, taking every precaution to gloss over his unfamiliarity with the pronunciation.  ��� �Ah! It is cloth like that,� he broke out, with a fury the intensity of which increased as the speed of his utterance diminished. �Ah! It is cloth like that; when I tell you that it is, officer�s cloth, when-I-tell-you-a-thing, if-I-tell-you-a-thing, it�s because I know, I should think.�  ��� �Very well, then;� replied the young graduate, overcome by the force of this argument. �Keep your hair on, old boy.�  ��� �There, look, there�s the Capstan coming along. No, but just look at Saint-Loup; the way he throws his leg out; and his head. Would you call that a non-com? And his eyeglass; oh, he�s hot stuff, he is.�  ���I asked these troopers, who did not seem at all embarrassed by my presence, whether I too might look out of the window. They neither objected to my doing so nor moved to make room for me. I saw Captain de Borodino go majestically by, putting his horse into a trot, and apparently under the illusion that he was taking part in the Battle of Austerlitz. A few loiterers had stopped by the gate to see the regiment file out. Erect on his charger, his face inclined to plumpness, his cheeks of an Imperial fulness, his eye lucid, the Prince must have been the victim of some hallucination, as I was myself whenever, after the tramway-car had passed, the silence that followed its rumble seemed to me to throb and echo with a vaguely musical palpitation. I was wretched at not having said good-bye to Saint-Loup, but I went nevertheless, for my one anxiety was to return to my grandmother; always until then, in this little country town, when I thought of what my grandmother must be doing by herself, I had pictured her as she was when with me, suppressing my own personality but without taking into account the effects of such a suppression; now, I had to free myself, at the first possible moment, in her arms, from the phantom, hitherto unsuspected and suddenly called into being by her voice, of a grandmother really separated from me, resigned, having, what I had never yet thought of her as having, a definite age, who had just received a letter from me in an empty house, as I had once before imagined Mamma in a house by herself, when I had left her to go to Balbec.  ���Alas, this phantom was just what I did see when, entering the drawing-room before my grandmother had been told of my return, I found her there, reading. I was in the room, or rather I was not yet in the room since she was not aware of my presence, and, like a woman whom one surprises at a piece of work which she will lay aside if anyone comes in, she had abandoned herself to a train of thoughts which she had never allowed to be visible by me. Of myself � thanks to that privilege which does not last but which one enjoys during the brief moment of return, the faculty of being a spectator, so to speak, of one�s own absence � there was present only the witness, the observer, with a hat and travelling coat, the stranger who does not belong to the house, the photographer who has called to take a photograph of places which one will never see again. The process that mechanically occurred in my eyes when I caught sight of my grandmother was indeed a photograph. We never see the people who are dear to us save in the animated system, the perpetual motion of our incessant love for them, which before allowing the images that their faces present to reach us catches them in its vortex, flings them back upon the idea that we have always had of them, makes them adhere to it, coincide with it. How, since into the forehead, the cheeks of my grandmother I had been accustomed to read all the most delicate, the most permanent qualities of her mind; how, since every casual glance is an act of necromancy, each face that we love a mirror of the past, how could I have failed to overlook what in her had become dulled and changed, seeing that in the most trivial spectacles of our daily life, our eye, charged with thought, neglects, as would a classical tragedy, every image that does not assist the action of the play and retains only those that may help to make its purpose intelligible. But if, in place of our eye, it should be a purely material object, a photographic plate, that has watched the action, then what we shall see, in the courtyard of the Institute, for example, will be, instead of the dignified emergence of an Academician who is going to hail a cab, his staggering gait, his precautions to avoid tumbling upon his back, the parabola of his fall, as though he were drunk, or the ground frozen over. So is it when some casual sport of chance prevents our intelligent and pious affection from coming forward in time to hide from our eyes what they ought never to behold, when it is forestalled by our eyes, and they, arising first in the field and having it to themselves, set to work mechanically, like films, and shew us, in place of the loved friend who has long ago ceased to exist but whose death our affection has always hitherto kept concealed from us, the new person whom a hundred times daily that affection has clothed with a dear and cheating likeness. And, as a sick man who for long has not looked at his own reflexion, and has kept his memory of the face that he never sees refreshed from the ideal image of himself that he carries in his mind, recoils on catching sight in the glass, in the midst of an arid waste of cheek, of the sloping red structure of a nose as huge as one of the pyramids of Egypt, I, for whom my grandmother was still myself, I who had never seen her save in my own soul, always at the same place in the past, through the transparent sheets of contiguous, overlapping memories, suddenly in our drawing-room which formed part of a new world, that of time, that in which dwell the strangers of whom we say �He�s begun to age a good deal,� for the first time and for a moment only, since she vanished at once, I saw, sitting on the sofa, beneath the lamp, red-faced, heavy and common, sick, lost in thought, following the lines of a book with eyes that seemed hardly sane, a dejected old woman whom I did not know.  ���My request to be allowed to inspect the Elstirs in Mme. de Guermantes�s collection had been met by Saint-Loup with: �I will answer for her.� And indeed, as ill luck would have it, it was he and he alone who did answer. We answer readily enough for other people when, setting our mental stage with the little puppets that represent them, we manipulate these to suit our fancy. No doubt even then we take into account the difficulties due to another person�s nature being different from our own, and we do not fail to have recourse to some plan of action likely to influence that nature, an appeal to his material interest, persuasion, the rousing of emotion, which will neutralise contrary tendencies on his part. But these differences from our own nature, it is still our own nature that is imagining them, these difficulties, it is we that are raising them; these compelling motives, it is we that are applying them. And so with the actions which before our mind�s eye we have made the other person rehearse, and which make him act as we choose; when we wish to see him perform them in real life, the case is altered, we come up against unseen resistances which may prove insuperable. One of the strongest is doubtless that which may be developed in a woman who is not in love with him by the disgust inspired in her, a fetid, insurmountable loathing, by the man who is in love with her; during the long weeks in which Saint-Loup still did not come to Paris, his aunt, to whom I had no doubt of his having written begging her to do so, never once asked me to call at her house to see the Elstirs.  ���I perceived signs of coldness on the part of another occupant of the building. This was Jupien. Did he consider that I ought to have gone in and said how d�ye do to him, on my return from Donci�res, before even going upstairs to our own flat? My mother said no, that there was nothing unusual about it. Fran�oise had told her that he was like that, subject to sudden fits of ill humour, without any cause. These invariably passed off after a little time.  ���Meanwhile the winter was drawing to an end. One morning, after several weeks of showers and storms, I heard in my chimney � instead of the wind, formless, elastic, sombre, which convulsed me with a longing to go to the sea � the cooing of the pigeons that were nesting in the wall outside; shimmering, unexpected, like a first hyacinth, gently tearing open its fostering heart that there might shoot forth, purple and satin-soft, its flower of sound, letting in like an opened window into my bedroom still shuttered and dark the heat, the dazzling brightness, the fatigue of a first fine day. That morning, I was surprised to find myself humming a music-hall tune which had never entered my head since the year in which I had been going to Florence and Venice. So profoundly does the atmosphere, as good days and bad recur, act on our organism and draw from dim shelves where we had forgotten them, the melodies written there which our memory rould not decipher. Presently a more conscious dreamer accompanied this musician to whom I was listening inside myself, without having recognised at first what he was playing.  ���I quite realised that it was not for any reason peculiar to Balbec that on my arrival there I had failed to find in its church the charm which it had had for me before I knew it; that at Florence or Parma or Venice my imagination could no more take the place of my eyes when I looked at the sights there. I realised this. Similarly, one New Year�s afternoon, as night fell, standing before a column of playbills, I had discovered the illusion that lies in our thinking that certain solemn holidays differ essentially from the other days in the calendar. And yet I could not prevent my memory of the time during which I had looked forward to spending Easter in Florence from continuing to make that festival the atmosphere, so to speak, of the City of Flowers, to give at once to Easter Day something Florentine and to Florence something Paschal. Easter was still a long way off; but in the range of days that stretched out before me the days of Holy Week stood out more clearly at the end of those that merely came between. Touched by a far-flung ray, like certain houses in a village which one sees from a distance when the rest are in shadow, they had caught and kept all the sun.  ���The weather had now become milder. And my parents themselves, by urging me to take more exercise, gave me an excuse for resuming my morning walks. I had meant to give them up, since they meant my meeting Mme. de Guermantes. But it was for this very reason that I kept thinking all the time of those walks, which led to my finding, every moment, a fresh reason for taking them, a reason that had no connexion with Mme. de Guermantes and no difficulty in convincing me that, had she never existed, I should still have taken a walk, without fail, at that hour every morning.  ���Alas, if to me meeting any person other than herself would not have mattered, I felt that to her meeting anyone in the world except myself would have been endurable. It happened that, in the course of her morning walks, she received the salutations of plenty of fools whom she regarded as such. But the appearance of these in her path seemed to her, if not to hold out any promise of pleasure, to be at any rate the result of mere accident. And she stopped them at times, for there are moments in which one wants to escape from oneself, to accept the hospitality offered by the soul of another person, provided always that the other, however modest and plain it may be, is a different soul, whereas in my heart she was exasperated to feel that what she would have found was herself. And so, even when I had, for taking the same way as she, another reason than my desire to see her, I trembled like a guilty man as she came past; and sometimes, so as to neutralise anything extravagant that there might seem to have been in my overtures, I would barely acknowledge her bow, or would fasten my eyes on her face without raising my hat, and succeed only in making her angrier than ever, and begin to regard me as insolent and ill-bred besides.  ���She was now wearing lighter, or at any rate brighter, clothes, and would come strolling down the street in which already, as though it were spring, in front of the narrow shops that were squeezed in between the huge fronts of the old aristocratic mansions, over the booths of the butter-woman and the fruit-woman and the vegetable-woman, awnings were spread to protect them from the sun. I said to myself that the woman whom I could see far off, walking, opening her sunshade, crossing the street, was, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, the greatest living exponent of the art of performing those movements and of making out of them something exquisitely lovely. Meanwhile she was advancing towards me, unconscious of this widespread reputation, her narrow, stubborn body, which had absorbed none of it, was bent stiffly forward under a scarf of violet silk; her clear, sullen eyes looked absently in front of her, and had perhaps caught sight of me; she was biting her lip; I saw her straighten her muff, give alms to a beggar, buy a bunch of violets from a flower-seller, with the same curiosity that I should have felt in watching the strokes of a great painter�s brush. And when, as she reached me, she gave me a bow that was accompanied sometimes by a faint smile, it was as though she had sketched in colour for me, adding a personal inscription to myself, a drawing that was a masterpiece of art. Each of her gowns seemed to me her natural, necessary surroundings, like the projection around her of a particular aspect of her soul. On one of these Lenten mornings, when she was on her way out to luncheon, I met her wearing a gown of bright red velvet, cut slightly open at the throat. The face of Mme. de Guermantes appeared to be dreaming, beneath its pile of fair hair. I was less sad than usual because the melancholy of her expression, the sort of claustration which the startling hue of her gown set between her and the rest of the world, made her seem somehow lonely and unhappy, and this comforted me. The gown struck me as being the materialisation round about her of the scarlet rays of a heart which I did not recognise as hers and might have been able, perhaps, to console; sheltered in the mystical light of the garment with its gently flowing folds, she made me think of some Saint of the early ages of Christianity. After which I felt ashamed of afflicting with the sight of myself this holy martyr. �But, after all, the streets are public.�  ���The streets are public, I reminded myself, giving a different meaning to the words, and marvelling that indeed in the crowded thoroughfare often soaked with rain, which made it beautiful and precious as a street sometimes is in the old towns of Italy, the Duchesse de Guermantes mingled with the public life of the world moments of her own secret life, shewing herself thus to all and sundry, jostled by every passer-by, with the splendid gratuitousness of the greatest works of art. As I had been out in the morning, after staying awake all night, in the afternoon my parents would tell me to lie down for a little and try to sleep. There is no need, when one is trying to find sleep, to give much thought to the quest, but habit is very useful, and even freedom from thought. But in these afternoon hours both were lacking. Before going to sleep, I devoted so much time to thinking that I should not be able to sleep, that even after I was asleep a little of my thought remained. It was no more than a glimmer in the almost total darkness, but it was bright enough to cast a reflexion in my sleep, first of the idea that I could not sleep, and then, a reflexion of this reflexion, that it was in my sleep that I had had the idea that I was not asleep, then, by a further refraction, my awakening . . . to a fresh doze in which I was trying to tell some friends who had come into my room that, a moment earlier, when I was asleep, I had imagined that I was not asleep. These shades were barely distinguishable; it would have required a keen � and quite useless � delicacy of perception to seize them all. Similarly, in later years, at Venice, long after the sun had set, when it seemed to be quite dark, I have seen, thanks to the echo, itself imperceptible, of a last note of light, held indefinitely on the surface of the canals, as though some optical pedal were being pressed, the reflexion of the palaces unfurled, as though for all time, in a darker velvet, on the crepuscular greyness of the water. One of my dreams was the synthesis of what my imagination had often sought to depict, in my waking hours, of a certain seagirt place and its mediaeval past. In my sleep I saw a gothic fortress rising from a sea whose waves were stilled as in a painted window. An arm of the sea cut the town in two; the green water stretched to my feet; it bathed on the opposite shore the foundations of an oriental church, and beyond it houses which existed already in the fourteenth century, so that to go across to them would have been to ascend the stream of time. This dream in which nature had learned from art, in which the sea had turned gothic, this dream in which I longed to attain, in which I believed that I was attaining to the impossible, it seemed to me that I had often dreamed it before. But as it is the property of what we imagine in our sleep to multiply itself in the past, and to appear, even when novel, familiar, I supposed that I was mistaken. I noticed, however, that I did frequently have this dream.  ���The limitations, too, that are common to all sleep were reflected in mine, but in a symbolical manner; I could not in the darkness make out the faces of the friends who were in the room, for we sleep with our eyes shut. I, who could carry on endless arguments with myself while I dreamed, as soon as I tried to speak to these friends felt the words stick in my throat, for we do not speak distinctly in our sleep; I wanted to go to them, and I could not move my limbs, for we do not walk when we are asleep either; and suddenly I was ashamed to be seen by them, for we sleep without our clothes. So, my eyes blinded, my lips sealed, my limbs fettered, my body naked, the figure of sleep which my sleep itself projected had the appearance of those great allegorical figures (in one of which Giotto has portrayed Envy with a serpent in her mouth) of which Swann had given me photographs.  ���Saint-Loup came to Paris for a few hours only. He came with assurances that he had had no opportunity of mentioning me to his aunt. �She�s not being at all nice just now, Oriane isn�t,� he explained, with innocent self-betrayal. �She�s not my old Oriane any longer, they�ve gone and changed her. I assure you, it�s not worth while bothering your head about her. You pay her far too great a compliment. You wouldn�t care to meet my cousin Poictiers?� he went on, without stopping to reflect that this could not possibly give me any pleasure. �Quite an intelligent young woman, she is; you�d like her. She�s married to my cousin, the Duc de Poictiers, who is a good fellow, but a bit slow for her. I�ve told her about you. She said I was to bring you to see her. She�s much better looking than Oriane, and younger, too. Really a nice person, don�t you know, really a good sort.� These were expressions recently � and all the more ardently � taken up by Robert, which meant that the person in question had a delicate nature. �I don�t go so far as to say she�s a Dreyfusard, you must remember the sort of people she lives among; still, she did say to me: �If he is innocent, how ghastly for him to be shut up on the Devil�s Isle.� You see what I mean, don�t you? And then she�s the sort of woman who does a tremendous lot for her old governesses; she�s given orders that they�re never to be sent in by the servants� stair, when they come to the house. She�s a very good sort, I assure you. The real reason why Oriane doesn�t like her is that she feels she�s the cleverer of the two.�  ���Although completely absorbed in the pity which she felt for one of the Guermantes footmen � who had no chance of going to see his girl, even when the Duchess was out, for it would immediately have been reported to her from the lodge � Fran�oise was heartbroken at not having been in the house at the moment of Saint-Loup�s visit, but this was because now she herself paid visits also. She never failed to go out on the days when I most wanted her. It was always to see her brother, her niece and, more particularly, her own daughter, who had recently come to live in Paris. The intimate nature of these visits itself increased the irritation that I felt at being deprived of her services, for I had a foreboding that she would speak of them as being among those duties from which there was no dispensation, according to the laws laid down at Saint-Andr�-des-Champs.  ���And so I never listened to her excuses without an ill humour which was highly unjust to her, and was brought to a climax by the way Fran�oise had of saying not: �I have been to see my brother,� or �I have been to see my niece,� but �I have been to see the brother,� �I just looked in as I passed to bid good day to the niece� (or �to my niece the butcheress�). As for her daughter, Fran�oise would have been glad to see her return to Combray. But this recent Parisian, making use, like a woman of fashion, of abbreviations, though hers were of a vulgar kind, protested that the week she was going shortly to spend at Combray would seem quite long enough without so much as a sight of �the Intran.� She was still less willing to go to Franchise�s sister, who lived in a mountainous country, for �mountains,� said the daughter, giving to the adjective a new and terrible meaning, �aren�t really interesting.� She could not make Up her mind to go back to M�s�glise, where �the people are so stupid,� where in the market the gossips at their stalls would call cousins with her, and say �Why, it�s never poor Bazireau�s daughter?� She would sooner die than go back and bury herself down there, now that she had �tasted the life of Paris,� and Fran�oise, traditionalist as she was, smiled complacently nevertheless at the spirit of innovation that was incarnate in this new Parisian when she said: �Very well, mother, if you don�t get your day out, you have only to send me a pneu.�  ���The weather had turned chilly again. �Go out? What for? To catch your death?� said Fran�oise, who preferred to remain in the house during the week which her daughter and brother and the butcher-niece had gone to spend at Combray. Being, moreover, the last surviving adherent of the sect in whom persisted obscurely the doctrine of my aunt L�onie � a natural philosopher � Fran�oise would add, speaking of this unseasonable weather: �It is the remnant of the wrath of God!� But I responded to her complaints only in a languid smile; all the more indifferent to these predictions, in that whatever befell it would be fine for me; already I could see the morning sun shine on the slope of Fiesole, I warmed myself in its rays; their strength obliged me to half open, half shut my eyelids, smiling the while, and my eyelids, like alabaster lamps, were filled with a rosy glow. It was not only the bells that came from Italy, Italy had come with them. My faithful hands would not lack flowers to honour the anniversary of the pilgrimage which I ought to have made long ago, for since, here in Paris, the weather had turned cold again as in another year at the time of our preparations for departure at the end of Lent, in the liquid, freezing air which bathed the chestnuts and planes on the boulevards, the tree in the courtyard of our house, there were already opening their petals, as in a bowl of pure water, the narcissi, the jonquils, the anemones of the Ponte Vecchio.  ���My father had informed us that he now knew, from his friend A. J., where M. de Norpois was going when he met him about the place.  ��� �It�s to see Mme. de Villeparisis, they are great friends; I never knew anything about it. It seems she�s a delightful person, a most superior woman. You ought to go and call on her,� he told me. �Another thing that surprised me very much. He spoke to me of M. de Guermantes as quite a distinguished man; I had always taken him for a boor. It seems, he knows an enormous amount, and has perfect taste, only he�s very proud of his name and his connexions. But for that matter, according to Norpois, he has a tremendous position, not only here but all over Europe. It appears, the Austrian Emperor and the Tsar treat him just like one of themselves. Old Norpois told me that Mme. de Villeparisis had taken quite a fancy to you, and that you would meet all sorts of interesting people in her house. He paid a great tribute to you; you will see him if you go there, and he may have some good advice for you even if you are going to be a writer. For you�re not likely to do anything else; I can see that. It might turn out quite a good career; it�s not what I should have chosen for you, myself; but you�ll be a man in no time now, we shan�t always be here to look after you, and we mustn�t prevent you from following your vocation.�  ���If only I had been able to start writing! But whatever the conditions in which I approached the task (as, too, alas, the undertakings not to touch alcohol, to go to bed early, to sleep, to keep fit), whether it were with enthusiasm, with method, with pleasure, in depriving myself of a walk, or postponing my walk and keeping it in reserve as a reward of industry, taking advantage of an hour of good health, utilising the inactivity forced on me by a day of illness, what always emerged in the end from all my effort was a virgin page, undefiled by any writing, ineluctable as that forced card which in certain tricks one invariably is made to draw, however carefully one may first have shuffled the pack. I was merely the instrument of habits of not working, of not going to bed, of not sleeping, which must find expression somehow, cost what it might; if I offered them no resistance, if I contented myself with the pretext they seized from the first opportunity that the day afforded them of acting as they chose, I escaped without serious injury, I slept for a few hours after all, towards morning, I read a little, I did not over-exert myself; but if I attempted to thwart them, if I pretended to go to bed early, to drink only water, to work, they grew restive, they adopted strong measures, they made me really ill, I was obliged to double my dose of alcohol, did not lie down in bed for two days and nights on end, could not even read, and I vowed that another time I would be more reasonable, that is to say less wise, like the victim of an assault who allows himself to be robbed for fear, should he offer resistance, of being murdered.  ���My father, in the meantime, had met M. de Guermantes once or twice, and, now that M. de Norpois had told him that the Duke was a remarkable man, had begun to pay more attention to what he said. As it happened, they met in the courtyard and discussed Mme. de Villeparisis. �He tells me, she�s his aunt; �Viparisi,� he pronounces it. He tells me, too, she�s an extraordinarily able woman. In fact he said she kept a School of Wit,� my father announced to us, impressed by the vagueness of this expression, which he had indeed come across now and then in volumes of memoirs, but without attaching to it any definite meaning. My mother, so great was her respect for him, when she saw that he did not dismiss as of no importance the fact that Mme. de Villeparisis kept a School of Wit, decided that this must be of some consequence. Albeit from my grandmother she had known all the time the exact amount of the Marquise�s intellectual worth, it was immediately enhanced in her eyes. My grandmother, who was not very well just then, was not in favour at first of the suggested visit, and afterwards lost interest in the matter. Since we had moved into our new flat, Mme. de Villeparisis had several times asked my grandmother to call upon her. And invariably my grandmother had replied that she was not going out just at present, in one of those letters which, by a new habit of hers which we did not understand, she no longer sealed herself, but employed Fran�oise to lick the envelopes for her. As for myself, without any very clear picture in my mind of this School of Wit, I should not have been greatly surprised to find the old lady from Balbec installed behind a desk, as, for that matter, I eventually did.  ���My father would have been glad to know, into the bargain, whether the Ambassador�s support would be worth many votes to him at the Institute, for which he had thoughts of standing as an independent candidate. To tell the truth, while he did not venture to doubt that he would have M. de Norpois�s support, he was by no means certain of it. He had thought it merely malicious gossip when they assured him at the Ministry that M. de Norpois, wishing to be himself the only representative there of the Institute, would put every possible obstacle in the way of my father�s candidature, which besides would be particularly awkward for him at that moment, since he was supporting another candidate already. And yet, when M. Leroy-Beaulieu had first advised him to stand, and had reckoned up his chances, my father had been struck by the fact that, among the colleagues upon whom he could count for support, the eminent economist had not mentioned M. de Norpois. He dared not ask the Ambassador point-blank, but hoped that I should return from my call on Mme. de Villeparisis with his election as good as secured. This call was now imminent. That M. de Norpois would carry on propaganda calculated to assure my father the votes of at least two thirds of the Academy seemed to him all the more probable since the Ambassador�s willingness to oblige was proverbial, those who liked him least admitting that no one else took such pleasure in being of service. And besides, at the Ministry, his protective influence was extended over my father far more markedly than over any other official.  ���My father had also another encounter about this time, but one at which his extreme surprise ended in equal indignation. In the street one day he ran into Mme. Sazerat, whose life in Paris her comparative poverty restricted to occasional visits to a friend. There was no one who bored my father quite so intensely as did Mme. Sazerat, so much so that Mamma was obliged, once a year, to intercede with him in sweet and suppliant tones: �My dear, I really must invite Mme. Sazerat to the house, just once; she won�t stay long;� and even: �Listen, dear, I am going to ask you to make a great sacrifice; do go and call upon Mme. Sazerat. You know I hate bothering you, but it would be so nice of you.� He would laugh, raise various objections, and go to pay the call. And so, for all that Mme. Sazerat did not appeal to him, on catching sight of her in the street my father went towards her, hat in hand; but to his profound astonishment Mme. Sazerat confined her greeting to the frigid bow enforced by politeness towards a person who is guilty of some disgraceful action or has been condemned to live, for the future, in another hemisphere. My father had come home speechless with rage. Next day my mother met Mme. Sazerat in some one�s house. She did not offer my mother her hand, but only smiled at her with a vague and melancholy air as one smiles at a person with whom one used to play as a child, but with whom one has since severed all one�s relations because she has led an abandoned life, has married a convict or (what is worse still) a co-respondent. Now, from all time my parents had accorded to Mme. Sazerat, and inspired in her, the most profound respect. But (and of this my mother was ignorant) Mme. Sazerat, alone of her kind at Combray, was a Dreyfusard. My father, a friend of M. M�line, was convinced that Dreyfus was guilty. He had flatly refused to listen to some of his colleagues who had asked him to sign a petition demanding a fresh trial. He never spoke to me for a week, after learning that I had chosen to take a different line. His opinions were well known. He came near to being looked upon as a Nationalist. As for my grandmother, in whom alone of the family a generous doubt was likely to be kindled, whenever anyone spoke to her of the possible innocence of Dreyfus, she gave a shake of her head, the meaning of which we did not at the time understand, but which was like the gesture of a person who has been interrupted while thinking of more serious things. My mother, torn between her love for my father and her hope that I might turn out to have brains, preserved an impartiality which she expressed by silence. Finally my grandfather, who adored the Army (albeit his duties with the National Guard had been the bugbear of his riper years), could never, at Combray, see a regiment go by the garden railings without baring his head as the colonel and the colours passed. All this was quite enough to make Mme. Sazerat, who knew every incident of the disinterested and honourable careers of my father and grandfather, regard them as pillars of Injustice. We pardon the crimes of individuals, but not their participation in a collective crime. As soon as she knew my father to be an anti-Dreyfusard she set between him and herself continents and centuries. Which explains why, across such an interval of time and space, her bow had been imperceptible to my father, and why it had not occurred to her to hold out her hand, or to say a few words which would never have carried across the worlds that lay between.  ���Saint-Loup, who was coming anyhow to Paris, had promised to take me to Mme. de Villeparisis�s, where I hoped, though I had not said so to him, that we might meet Mme. de Guermantes. He invited me to luncheon in a restaurant with his mistress, whom we were afterwards to accompany to a rehearsal. We were to go out in the morning and call for her at her home on the outskirts of Paris.  ���I had asked Saint-Loup that the restaurant to which we went for luncheon (in the lives of young noblemen with money to spend the restaurant plays as important a part as do bales of merchandise in Arabian stories), might, if possible, be that to which Aim� had told me that he would be going as head waiter until the Balbec season started. It was a great attraction to me who dreamed of so many expeditions and made so few to see again some one who formed part not merely of my memories of Balbec but of Balbec itself, who went there year after year, who when ill health or my studies compelled me to stay in Paris would be watching, just the same, through the long July afternoons while he waited for the guests to come in to dinner, the sun creep down the sky and set in the sea, through the glass panels of the great dining-room, behind which, at the hour when the light died, the motionless wings of vessels, smoky blue in the distance, looked like exotic and nocturnal moths in a show-case. Himself magnetised by his contact with the strong lodestone of Balbec, this head waiter became in turn a magnet attracting me. I hoped by talking to him to get at once into communication with Balbec, to have realised here in Paris something of the delights of travel.  ���I left the house early, with Fran�oise complaining bitterly because the footman who was engaged to be married had once again been prevented, the evening before, from going to see his girl. Fran�oise had found him in tears; he had been itching to go and strike the porter, but had restrained himself, for he valued his place.  ���Before reaching Saint-Loup�s, where he was to be waiting for me at the door, I ran into Legrandin, of whom we had lost sight since our Combray days, and who, though now grown quite grey, had preserved his air of youthful candour. Seeing me, he stopped:  ��� �Ah! So it�s you,� he exclaimed, �a man of fashion, and in a frock coat too! That is a livery in which my independent spirit would be ill at ease. It is true that you are a man of the world, I suppose, and go out paying calls! To go and dream, as I do, before some half ruined tomb, my flowing tie and jacket are not out of place. You know how I admire the charming quality of your soul; that is why I tell you how deeply I regret that you should go forth and deny it among the Gentiles. By being capable of remaining for a moment in the nauseating atmosphere � which I am unable to breathe � of a drawing-room, you pronounce on your own future the condemnation, the damnation of the Prophet. I can see it all, you frequent the �light hearts,� the houses of the great, that is the vice of our middle class to-day. Ah! Those aristocrats! The Terror was greatly to blame for not cutting the heads off every one of them. They are all sinister debauchees, when they are not simply dreary idiots. Still, my poor boy, if that sort of thing amuses you! While you are on your way to your tea-party your old friend will be more fortunate than you, for alone in an outlying suburb he will be watching the pink moon rise in a violet sky. The truth is that I scarcely belong to this Earth upon which I feel myself such an exile; it takes all the force of the law of gravity to hold me here, to keep nie from escaping into another sphere. I belong to a different planet. Goodbye; do not take amiss the old-time frankness of the peasant of the Vivonne, who has also remained a peasant of the Danube. To prove to you that I am your sincere well-wisher, I am going to send you my last novel. But you will not care for it; it is not deliquescent enough, not fin de si�cle enough for you; it is too frank, too honest; what you want is Bergotte, you have confessed it, high game for the jaded palates of pleasure-seeking epicures. I suppose I am looked upon, in your set, as an old campaigner; I do wrong to put my heart into what I write, that is no longer done; besides, the life of the people is not distinguished enough to interest your little snobbicules. Go, get you gone, try to recall at times the words of Christ: �Do this and ye shall live.� Farewell, Friend.�  ���It was not with any particular resentment against Legrandin that I parted from him. Certain memories are like friends in common, they can bring about reconciliations; set down amid fields starred with buttercups, upon which were piled the ruins of feudal greatness, the little wooden bridge still joined us, Legrandin and me, as it joined the two banks of the Vivonne.  ���After coming out of a Paris in which, although spring had begun, the trees on the boulevards had hardly put on their first leaves, it was a marvel to Saint-Loup and myself, when the circle train had set us down at the suburban village in which his mistress was living, to see every cottage garden gay with huge festal altars of fruit trees in blossom. It was like one of those peculiar, poetical, ephemeral, local festivals which people travel long distances to attend on certain fixed occasions, only this one was held by Nature. The bloom of the cherry tree is stuck so close to its branches, like a white sheath, that from a distance, among the other trees that shewed as yet scarcely a flower or leaf, one might have taken it, on this day of sunshine that was still so cold, for snow, melted everywhere else, which still clung to the bushes. But the tall pear trees enveloped each house, each modest courtyard in a whiteness more vast, more uniform, more dazzling, as if all the dwellings, all the enclosed spaces in the village were on their way to make, on one solemn date, their first communion.  ���It had been a country village, and had kept its old mayor�s office sunburned and brown, in front of which, in the place of maypoles and streamers, three tall pear trees were, as though for some civic and local festival, gallantly beflagged with white satin. These villages in the environs of Paris still have at their gates parks of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which were the �follies� of the stewards and favourites of the great. A fruit-grower had utilised one of these which was sunk below the road for his trees, or had simply, perhaps, preserved the plan of an immense orchard of former days. Laid out in quincunxes, these pear trees, less crowded and not so far on as those that I had seen, formed great quadrilaterals � separated by low walls � of snowy blossom, on each side of which the light fell differently, so that all these airy roofless chambers seemed to belong to a Palace of the Sun, such as one might unearth in Crete or somewhere; and made one think also of the different ponds of a reservoir, or of those parts of the sea which man, for some fishery, or to plant oyster-beds, has subdivided, when one saw, varying with the orientation of the boughs, the light fall and play upon their trained arms as upon water warm with spring, and coax into unfolding here and there, gleaming amid the open, azure-panelled trellis of the branches, the foaming whiteness of a creamy, sunlit flower.  ���Never had Robert spoken to me so tenderly of his friend as he did during this walk. She alone had taken root in his heart; his future career in the Army, his position in society, his family, he was not, of course, indifferent altogether to these, but they were of no account compared with the veriest trifle that concerned his mistress. That alone had any importance in his eyes, infinitely more importance than the Guermantes and all the kings of the earth put together. I do not know whether he had formulated the doctrine that she was of a superior quality to anyone else, but I do know that he considered, took trouble only about what affected her. Through her and for her he was capable of suffering, of being happy, perhaps of doing murder. There was really nothing that interested, that could excite him except what his mistress wished, was going to do, what was going on, discernible at most in fleeting changes of expression, in the narrow expanse of her face and behind her privileged brow. So nice-minded in all else, he looked forward to the prospect of a brilliant marriage, solely in order to be able to continue to maintain her, to keep her always. If one had asked oneself what was the value that he set on her, I doubt whether one could ever have imagined a figure high enough. If he did not marry her, it was because a practical instinct warned him that as soon as she had nothing more to expect from him she would leave him, or would at least live as she chose, and that he must retain his hold on her by keeping her in suspense from day to day. For he admitted the possibility that she did not love him. No doubt the general affection called love must have forced him � as it forces all men � to believe at times that she did. But in his heart of hearts he felt that this love which she felt for him did not exhaust the possibility of her remaining with him only on account of his money, and that on the day when she had nothing more to expect from him she would make haste (the dupe of her friends and their literary theories, and loving him all the time, really � he thought) to leave him. �If she is nice to me to-day,� he confided to me, �I am going to give her something that she�ll like. It�s a necklace she saw at Boucheron�s. It�s rather too much for me just at present � thirty thousand francs. But, poor puss, she gets so little pleasure out of life. She will be jolly pleased with it, I know. She mentioned it to me and told me she knew somebody who would perhaps give it to her. I don t believe that is true, really, but I wasn�t taking any risks, so I�ve arranged with Boucheron, who is our family jeweller, to keep it for me. I am glad to think that you�re going to meet her; she�s nothing so very wonderful to look at, you know,� (I could see that he thought just the opposite and had said this only so as to make me, when I did see her, admire her all the more) �what she has got is a marvellous judgment; she�ll perhaps be afraid to talk much before you, but, by Jove! the things she�ll say to me about you afterwards, you know she says things one can go on thinking about for hours; there�s really something about her that�s quite Pythian.�  ���On our way to her house we passed by a row of little gardens, and I was obliged to stop, for they were all aflower with pear and cherry blossoms; as empty, no doubt, and lifeless only yesterday as a house that no tenant has taken, they were suddenly peopled and adorned by these newcomers, arrived during the night, whose lovely white garments we could see through the railings along the garden paths.  ��� �Listen; I can see you�d rather stop and look at that stuff, and grow poetical about it,� said Robert, �so just wait for me here, will you; my friend�s house is quite close, I will go and fetch her.�  ���While I waited I strolled up and down the road, past these modest gardens. If I raised my head I could see, now and then, girls sitting in the windows, but outside, in the open air, and at the height of a half-landing, here and there, light and pliant, in their fresh pink gowns, hanging among the leaves, young lilac-clusters were letting themselves be swung by the breeze without heeding the passer-by who was turning his eyes towards their green mansions. I recognised in them the platoons in violet uniform posted at the entrance to M. Swann�s park, past the little white fence, in the warm afternoons of spring, like an enchanting rustic tapestry. I took a path which led me into a meadow. A cold wind blew keenly along it, as at Combray, but from the midst of the rich, moist, country soil, which might have been on the bank of the Vivonne, there had nevertheless arisen, punctual at the trysting place like all its band of brothers, a great white pear tree which waved smilingly in the sun�s face, like a curtain of light materialised and made palpable, its flowers shaken by the breeze but polished and frosted with silver by the sun�s rays.  ���Suddenly Saint-Loup appeared, accompanied by his mistress, and then, in this woman who was for him all the love, every possible delight in life, whose personality, mysteriously enshrined in a body as in a Tabernacle, was the object that still occupied incessantly the toiling imagination of my friend, whom he felt that he would never really know, as to whom he was perpetually asking himself what could be her secret self, behind the veil of eyes and flesh, in this woman I recognised at once �Rachel when from the Lord,� her who, but a few years since � women change their position so rapidly in that world, when they do change � used to say to the procuress: �To-morrow evening, then, if you want me for anyone, you will send round, won�t you?�  ���And when they had �come round� for her, and she found herself alone in the room with the �anyone,� she had known so well what was required of her that after locking the door, as a prudent woman�s precaution or a ritual gesture, she would begin to take off all her things, as one does before the doctor who is going to sound one�s chest, never stopping in the process unless the �some one,� not caring for nudity, told her that she might keep on her shift, as specialists do sometimes who, having an extremely fine ear and being afraid of their patient�s catching a chill, are satisfied with listening to his breathing and the beating of his heart through his shirt. On this woman whose whole life, all her thoughts, all her past, all the men who at one time or another had had her were to me so utterly unimportant that if she had begun to tell me about them I should have listened to her only out of politeness, and should barely have heard what she said, I felt that the anxiety, the torment, the love of Saint-Loup had been concentrated in such a way as to make � out of what was for me a mechanical toy, nothing more � the cause of endless suffering, the very object and reward of existence. Seeing these two elements separately (because I had known �Rachel when from the Lord� in a house of ill fame), I realised that many women for the sake of whom men live, suffer, take their lives, may be in themselves or for other people what Rachel was for me. The idea that any one could be tormented by curiosity with regard to her life stupefied me. I could have told Robert of any number of her unchastities, which seemed to me the most uninteresting things in the world. And how they would have pained him! And what had he not given to learn them, without avail!  ���I realised also then all that the human imagination can put behind a little scrap of face, such as this girl�s face was, if it is the imagination that was the first to know it; and conversely into what wretched elements, crudely material and utterly without value, might be decomposed what had been the inspiration of countless dreams if, on the contrary, it should be so to speak controverted by the slightest actual acquaintance. I saw that what had appeared to me to be not worth twenty francs when it had been offered to me for twenty francs in the house of ill fame, where it was then for me simply a woman desirous of earning twenty francs, might be worth more than a million, more than one�s family, more than all the most coveted positions in life if one had begun by imagining her to embody a strange creature, interesting to know, difficult to seize and to hold. No doubt it was the same thin and narrow face that we saw, Robert and I. But we had arrived at it by two opposite ways, between which there was no communication, and we should never both see it from the same side. That face, with its stares, its smiles, the movements of its lips, I had known from outside as being simply that of a woman of the sort who for twenty francs would do anything that I asked. And so her stares, her smiles, the movements of her lips had seemed to me significant merely of the general actions of a class without any distinctive quality. And beneath them I should not have had the curiosity to look for a person. But what to me had in a sense been offered at the start, that consenting face, had been for Robert an ultimate goal towards which he had made his way through endless hopes and doubts, suspicions, dreams. He gave more than a million francs in order to have for himself, in order that there might not be offered to others what had been offered to me, as to all and sundry, for a score. That he too should not have enjoyed it at the lower price may have been due to the chance of a moment, the instant in which she who seemed ready to yield herself makes off, having perhaps an assignation elsewhere, some reason which makes her more difficult of access that day. Should the man be a sentimentalist, then, even if she has not observed it, but infinitely more if she has, the direst game begins. Unable to swallow his disappointment, to make himself forget about the woman, he starts afresh in pursuit, she flies him, until a mere smile for which he no longer ventured to hope is bought at a thousand times what should have been the price of the last, the most intimate favours. It happens even at times in such a case, when one has been led by a mixture of simplicity in one�s judgment and cowardice in the face of suffering to commit the crowning folly of making an inaccessible idol of a girl, that these last favours, or even the first kiss one is fated never to obtain, one no longer even ventures to ask for them for fear of destroying one�s chances of Platonic love. And it is then a bitter anguish to leave the world without having ever known what were the embraces of the woman one has most passionately loved. As for Rachel�s favours, however, Saint-Loup had by mere accident succeeded in winning them all. Certainly if he had now learned that they had been offered to all the world for a louis, he would have suffered, of course, acutely, but would still have given a million francs for the right to keep them, for nothing that he might have learned could have made him emerge � since that is beyond human control and can be brought to pass only in spite of it by the action of some great natural law � from the path he was treading, from which that face could appear to him only through the web of the dreams that he had already spun. The immobility of that thin face, like that of a sheet of paper subjected to the colossal pressure of two atmospheres, seemed to me to be being maintained by two infinities which abutted on her without meeting, for she held them apart. And indeed, when Robert and I were both looking at her we did not both see her from the same side of the mystery.  ���It was not �Rachel when from the Lord�� who seemed to me a small matter � it was the power of the human imagination, the illusion on which were based the pains of love; these I felt to be vast. Robert noticed that I appeared moved. I turned my eyes to the pear and cherry trees of the garden opposite, so that he might think that it was their beauty that had touched me. And it did touch me in somewhat the same way; it also brought close to me things of the kind which we not only see with our eyes but feel also in our hearts. These trees that I had seen in the garden, likening them in my mind to strange deities, had not my mistake been like the Magdalene�s when, in another garden, she saw a human form and �thought it was the gardener.� Treasurers of our memories of the age of gold, keepers of the promise that reality is not what we suppose, that the splendour of Poetry, the wonderful radiance of innocence may shine in it and may be the recompense which we strive to earn, these great white creatures, bowed in a marvellous fashion above the shade propitious for rest, for angling or for reading, were they not rather angels? I exchanged a few words with Saint-Loup�s mistress. We cut across the village. Its houses were sordid. But by each of the most wretched, of those that looked as though they had been scorched and branded by a rain of brimstone, a mysterious traveller, halting for a day in the accursed city, a resplendent angel stood erect, extending broadly over it the dazzling protection of the wings of flowering innocence: it was a pear tree. Saint-Loup drew me a little way in front to explain.  ��� �I should have liked it if you and I could have been alone together, in fact I would much rather have had luncheon just with you, and stayed with you until it was time to go to my aunt�s. But this poor girl of mine here, it is such a pleasure to her, and she is so decent to me, don�t you know, I hadn�t the heart to refuse her. You�ll like her, however, she�s literary, you know, a most sensitive nature, and besides it�s such a pleasure to be with her in a restaurant, she is so charming, so simple, always delighted with every, thing.�  ���I fancy nevertheless that, on this same morning, and then probably for the first and last time, Robert did detach himself for a moment from the woman whom out of successive layers of affection he had gradually created, and beheld suddenly at some distance from himself another Rachel, outwardly the double of his but entirely different, who was nothing more or less than a little light of love. We had left the blossoming orchard and were making for the train which was to take us to Paris when, at the station, Rachel, who was walking by herself, was recognised and accosted by a pair of common little �tarts� like herself, who first of all, thinking that she was alone, called out: �Hello, Rachel, you come with us; Lucienne and Germaine are in the train, and there�s room for one more. Come on. We�re all going to the rink,� and were just going to introduce to her two counter-jumpers, their lovers, who were escorting them, when, noticing that she seemed a little uneasy, they looked up and beyond her, caught sight of us, and with apologies bade her a good-bye to which she responded in a somewhat embarrassed, but still friendly tone. They were two poor little �tarts� with collars of sham otter skin, looking more or less as Rachel must have looked when Saint-Loup first met her. He did not know them, or their names even, and seeing that they appeared to be extremely intimate with his mistress he could not help wondering whether she too might not once have had, had not still perhaps her place in a life of which he had never dreamed, utterly different from the life she led with him, a life in which one had women for a louis apiece, whereas he was giving more than a hundred thousand francs a year to Rachel, He caught only a fleeting glimpse of that life, but saw also in the thick of it a Rachel other than her whom he knew, a Rachel like the two little �tarts� in the train, a twenty-franc Rachel. In short, Rachel had for the moment duplicated herself in his eyes, he had seen, at some distance from his own Rachel, the little �tart� Rachel, the real Rachel, assuming that Rachel the �tart� was more real than the other. It may then have occurred to Robert that from the hell in which he was living, with the prospect of a rich marriage, of the sale of his name, to enable him to go on giving Rachel a hundred thousand francs every year, he might easily perhaps have escaped, and have enjoyed the favours of his mistress, as the two counter-jumpers enjoyed those of their girls, for next to nothing. But how was it to be done? She had done nothing to forfeit his regard. Less generously rewarded she would be less kind to him, would stop saying and writing the things that so deeply moved him> things which he would quote, with a touch of ostentation, to his friends, taking care to point out how nice it was of her to say them, but omitting to mention that he was maintaining her in the most lavish fashion, or even that he ever gave her anything at all, that these inscriptions on photographs, or greetings at the end of telegrams were but the conversion into the most exiguous, the most precious of currencies of a hundred thousand francs. If he took care not to admit that these rare kindnesses on Rachel�s part were handsomely paid for by himself, it would be wrong to say � and yet, by a crude piece of reasoning, we do say it, absurdly, of every lover who pays in cash for his pleasure, and of a great many husbands � that this was from self-esteem or vanity. Saint-Loup had enough sense to perceive that all the pleasures which appeal to vanity he could have found easily and without cost to himself in society, on the strength of his historic name and handsome face, and that his connexion with Rachel had rather, if anything, tended to ostracise him, led to his being less sought after. No; this self-esteem which seeks to appear to be receiving gratuitously the outward signs of the affection of her whom one loves is simply a consequence of love, the need to figure in one�s own eyes and in other people�s as loved in return by the person whom one loves so well. Rachel rejoined us, leaving the two �tarts� to get into their compartment; but, no less than their sham otter skins and the self-conscious appearance of their young men, the names Lucienne and Germaine kept the new Rachel alive for a moment longer. For a moment Robert imagined a Place Pigalle existence with unknown associates, sordid love affairs, afternoons spent in simple amusements, excursions or pleasure-parties, in that Paris in which the sunny brightness of the streets from the Boulevard de Clichy onwards did not seem the same as the solar radiance in which he himself strolled with his mistress, but must be something different, for love, and suffering which is one with love, have, like intoxication, the power to alter for us inanimate things. It was almost an unknown Paris in the heart of Paris itself that he suspected, his connexion appeared to him like the exploration of a strange form of life, for if when with him Rachel was somewhat similar to himself, it was nevertheless a part of her real life that she lived with him, indeed the most precious part, in view of his reckless expenditure on her, the part that made her so greatly envied by her friends and would enable her one day to retire to the country or to establish herself in the leading theatres, when she had made her pile. Robert longed to ask her who Lucienne and Germaine were, what they would have said to her if she had joined them in their compartment, how they would all have spent a day which would have perhaps ended, as a supreme diversion, after the pleasures of the rink, at the Olympia Tavern, if Robert and I had not been there. For a moment the purlieus of the Olympia, which until then had seemed to him merely deadly dull, aroused curiosity in him and pain, and the sunshine of this spring day beating upon the Rue Caumartin where, possibly, if she had not known Robert, Rachel might have gone in the course of the evening and nave earned a louis, filled him with a vague longing. But what use was it to ply Rachel with questions when he already knew that her answer would be merely silence, or a lie, or something extremely painful for him to hear, which would yet explain nothing. The porters were shutting the doors; we jumped into a first-class carriage; Rachel�s magnificent pearls reminded Robert that she was a woman of great price, he caressed her, restored her to her place in his heart where he could contemplate her, internalised, as he had always done hitherto � save during this brief instant in which he had seen her in the Place Pigalle of an impressionist painter � and the train began to move.  ���It was, by the way, quite true that she was �literary.� She never stopped talking to me about books, new art and Tolstoyism except to rebuke Saint-Loup for drinking so much wine:  ��� �Ah! If you could live with me for a year, we�d see a fine change. I should keep you on water and you�d be ever so much better.�  ��� �Right you are. Let�s begin now.�  ��� �But you know quite well I have to work all day!� For she took her art very seriously. �Besides, what would your people say?�  ���And she began to abuse his family to me in terms which for that matter seemed to me highly reasonable, and with which Saint-Loup, while disobeying her orders in the matter of champagne, entirely concurred. I, who was so much afraid of the effect of wine on him, and felt the good influence of his mistress, was quite prepared to advise him to let his family go hang. Tears sprang to the young woman�s eyes; I had been rash enough to refer to Dreyfus.  ��� �The poor martyr!� she almost sobbed; �it will be the death of him in that dreadful place.�  ��� �Don�t upset yourself, Z�zette, he will come back, he will be acquitted all right, they will admit they�ve made a mistake.�  ��� �But long before then he�ll be dead! Oh, well at any rate his children will bear a stainless name. But just think of the agony he must be going through; that�s what makes my heart bleed. And would you believe that Robert�s mother, a pious woman, says that he ought to be left on the Devil�s Isle, even if he is innocent; isn�t it appalling?�  ��� �Yes, it�s absolutely true, she does say that,� Robert assured me. �She�s my mother, I�ve no fault to find with her, but it�s quite clear she hasn�t got a sensitive nature, like Z�zette.�  ���As a matter of fact these luncheons which were said to be �such a pleasure� always ended in trouble. For as soon as Saint-Loup found himself in a public place with his mistress, he would imagine that she was looking at every other man in the room, and his brow would darken; she would remark his ill-humour, which she may have thought it amusing to encourage, or, as was more probable, by a foolish piece of conceit preferred, feeling wounded by his tone, not to appear to be seeking to disarm; and would make a show of being unable to take her eyes off some man or other, not that this was always a mere pretence. In fact, the gentleman who, in theatre or caf�, happened to sit next to them, or, to go no farther, the driver of the cab they had engaged need only have something attractive about him, no matter what, and Robert, his perception quickened by jealousy, would have noticed it before his mistress; he would see in him immediately one of those foul creatures whom he had denounced to me at Balbec, who corrupted and dishonoured women for their own amusement, would beg his mistress to take her eyes off the man, thereby drawing her attention to him. And sometimes she found that Robert had shewn such good judgment in his suspicion that after a little she even left off teasing him in order that he might calm down and consent to go off by himself on some errand which would give her time to begin conversation with the stranger, often to make an assignation, sometimes even to bring matters quickly to a head. I could see as soon as we entered the restaurant that Robert was looking troubled. The fact of the matter was that he had at once remarked, what had escaped our notice at Balbec, namely that, standing among his coarser colleagues, Aim�, with a modest brilliance, emitted, quite unconsciously of course, that air of romance which emanates until a certain period in life from fine hair and a Grecian nose, features thanks to which he was distinguishable among the crowd of waiters. The others, almost all of them well on in years, presented a series of types, extraordinarily ugly and criminal, of hypocritical priests, sanctimonious confessors, more numerously of comic actors of the old school, whose sugar-loaf foreheads are scarcely to be seen nowadays outside the collections of portraits that hang in the humbly historic green-rooms of little, out of date theatres, where they are represented in the parts of servants or high priests, though this restaurant seemed, thanks to a selective method of recruiting and perhaps to some system of hereditary nomination, to have preserved their solemn type in a sort of College of Augurs. As ill luck would have it, Aim� having recognised us, it was he who came to take our order, while the procession of operatic high priests swept past us to other tables. Aim� inquired after my grandmother�s health; I asked for news of his wife and children. He gave it with emotion, being a family man. He had an intelligent, vigorous, but respectful air. Robert�s mistress began to gaze at him with a strange attentiveness. But Aim�s sunken eyes, in which a slight short-sightedness gave one the impression of veiled depths, shewed no sign of consciousness in his still face. In the provincial hotel in which he had served for many years before coming to Balbec, the charming sketch, now a trifle discoloured and faded, which was his face, and which, for all those years, like some engraved portrait of Prince Eug�ne, had been visible always at the same place, at the far end of a dining-room that was almost always empty, could not have attracted any very curious gaze. He had thus for long remained, doubtless for want of sympathetic admirers, in ignorance of the artistic value of his face, and but little inclined for that matter to draw attention to it, for he was temperamentally cold. At the most, some passing Parisian, stopping for some reason in the town, had raised her eyes to his, had asked him perhaps to bring something to her in her room before she left for the station, and in the pellucid, Monotonous, deep void of this existence of a faithful husband and servant in a country town had hidden the secret of a caprice without sequel which no one would ever bring to light. And yet Aim� must have been conscious of the insistent emphasis with which the eyes of the young actress were fastened upon him now. Anyhow, it did not escape Robert beneath whose skin I saw gathering a flush, not vivid like that which burned his cheeks when he felt any sudden emotion, but faint, diffused.  ��� �Anything specially interesting about that waiter, Z�zette?� he inquired, after sharply dismissing Aim�. �One would think you were studying the part.�  ��� �There you are, beginning again; I knew it was coming.�  ��� �Beginning what again, my dear girl? I may have been mistaken; I haven�t said anything, I�m sure. But I have at least the right to warn you against the fellow, seeing that I knew him at Balbec (otherwise I shouldn�t give a damn), and a bigger scoundrel doesn�t walk the face of the earth.�  ���She seemed anxious to pacify Robert and began to engage me in a literary conversation in which he joined. I found that it did not bore me to talk to her, for she had a thorough knowledge of the books that I most admired, and her opinion of them agreed more or less with my own; but as I had heard Mme. de Villeparisis declare that she had no talent, I attached but little importance to this evidence of culture. She discoursed wittily on all manner of topics, and would have been genuinely entertaining had she not affected to an irritating extent the jargon of the sets and studios. She applied this, moreover, to everything under the sun; for instance, having acquired the habit of saying of a picture, if it were impressionist, or an opera, if Wagnerian, �Ah! That is good!� one day when a young man had kissed her on the ear, and, touched by her pretence of being thrilled, had affected modesty, she said: �Yes, as a sensation I call it distinctly good.� But what more surprised me was that the expressions peculiar to Robert (which, moreover, had come to him, perhaps, from literary men whom she knew) were used by her to him and by him to her as though they had been a necessary form of speech, and without any conception of the pointlessness of an originality that is universal.  ���In eating, she managed her hands so clumsily that one assumed that she must appear extremely awkward upon the stage. She recovered her dexterity only when making love, with that touching prescience latent in women who love the male body so intensely that they immediately guess what will give most pleasure to that body, which is yet so different from their own.  ���I ceased to take part in the conversation when it turned upon the theatre, for on that topic Rachel was too malicious for my liking. She did, it was true, take up in a tone of commiseration � against Saint-Loup, which proved that he was accustomed to hearing Rachel attack her � the defence of Berma, saying: �Oh, no, she�s a wonderful person, really. Of course, the things she does no longer appeal to us, they don�t correspond quite to what we are looking for, but one must think of her at the period to which she belongs; we owe her a great deal. She has done good work, you know. And besides she�s such a fine woman, she has such a good heart; naturally she doesn�t care about the things that interest us, but she has had in her time, with a rather impressive face, a charming quality of mind.� (Our ringers, by the way, do not play the same accompaniment to all our aesthetic judgments. If it is a picture that is under discussion, to shew that it is a fine work with plenty of paint, it is enough to stick out one�s thumb. But the �charming quality of mind� is more exacting. It requires two fingers, or rather two fingernails, as though one were trying to flick off a particle of dust.) But, with this single exception, Saint-Loup�s mistress referred to the best-known actresses in a tone of ironical superiority which annoyed me because I believed � quite mistakenly, as it happened � that it was she who was inferior to them. She was clearly aware that I must regard her as an indifferent actress, and on the other hand have a great regard for those she despised. But she shewed no resentment, because there is in all great talent while it is still, as hers was then, unrecognised, however sure it may be of itself, a vein of humility, and because we make the consideration that we expect from others proportionate not to our latent powers but to the position to which we have attained. (I was, an hour or so later, at the theatre, to see Saint-Loup�s mistress shew great deference towards those very artists against whom she was now bringing so harsh a judgment to bear.) And so, in however little doubt my silence may have left her, she insisted nevertheless on our dining together that evening, assuring me that never had anyone�s conversation delighted her so much as mine. If we were not yet in the theatre, to which we were to go after luncheon, we had the sense of being in a green-room hung with portraits of old members of the company, so markedly were the waiters� faces those which, one thought, had perished with a whole generation of obscure actors of the Palais-Royal; they had a look, also, of Academicians; stopping before a side table one of them was examining a dish of pears with the expression of detached curiosity that M. de Jussieu might have worn. Others, on either side of him, were casting about the room that gaze instinct with curiosity and coldness which Members of the Institute, who have arrived early, throw at the public, while they exchange a few murmured words which one fails to catch. They were faces well known to all the regular guests. One of them, however, was being pointed out, a newcomer with distended nostrils and a smug upper lip, who looked like a cleric; he was entering upon his duties there for the first time, and everyone gazed with interest at this newly elected candidate. But presently, perhaps to drive Robert away so that she might be alone with Aim�, Rachel began to make eyes at a young student, who was feeding with another man at a neighbouring table.  ��� �Z�zette, let me beg you not to look at that young man like that,� said Saint-Loup, on whose face the hesitating flush of a moment ago had been gathered now into a scarlet tide which dilated and darkened his swollen features, �if you must make a scene here, I shall simply finish eating by myself and join you at the theatre afterwards.�  ���At this point a messenger came up to tell Aim� that he was wanted to speak to a gentleman in a carriage outside. Saint-Loup, ever uneasy, and afraid now that it might be some message of an amorous nature that was to be conveyed to his mistress, looked out of the window and saw there, sitting up in his brougham, his hands tightly buttoned in white gloves with black seams, a flower in his buttonhole, M. de Charlus.  ��� �There; you see!� he said to me in a low voice, �my family hunt me down even here. Will you, please � I can�t very well do it myself, but you can, as you know the head waiter so well and he�s certain to give us away � ask him not to go to the carriage. He can ahvays send some other waiter who doesn�t know me. I know my uncle; if they tell him that I�m not known here, he�ll never come inside to look for me, he loathes this sort of place. Really, it�s pretty disgusting that an old petticoat-chaser like him, who is still at it, too, should be perpetually lecturing me and coming to spy on me!�  ���Aim� on receiving my instructions sent one of his underlings to explain that he was busy and could not come out at the moment, and (should the gentleman ask for the Marquis de Saint-Loup) that they did not know any such person. But Saint-Loup�s mistress, who had failed to catch our whispered conversation and thought that it was still about the young man at whom Robert had been finding fault with her for making eyes, broke out in a torrent of rage.  ��� �Oh, indeed! So it�s the young man over there, now, is it? Thank you for telling me; it�s a real pleasure to have this sort of thing with one�s meals! Don�t listen to him, please; he�s rather cross to-day, and, you know,� she went on, turning to me, �he just says it because he thinks it smart, that it�s the gentlemanly thing to appear jealous always.�  ���And she began with feet and fingers to shew signs of nervous irritation.  ��� �But, Z�zette, it is I who find it unpleasant. You are making us all ridiculous before that gentleman, who will begin to imagine you�re making overtures to him, and an impossible bounder he looks, too.�  ��� �Oh, no, I think he�s charming; for one thing, he�s got the most adorable eyes, and a way of looking at women � you can feel he must love them.�  ��� �You can at least keep quiet until I�ve left the room, if you have lost your senses,� cried Robert. �Waiter, my things.�  ���I did not know whether I was expected to follow him.  ��� �No, I want to be alone,� he told me in the same tone in which he had just been addressing his mistress, and as if he were quite furious with me. His anger was like a single musical phrase to which in an opera several lines are sung which are entirely different from one another, if one studies the words, in meaning and character, but which the music assimilates by a common sentiment. When Robert had gone, his mistress called Aim� and asked him various questions. She then wanted to know what I thought of him.  ��� �An amusing expression, hasn�t he? Do you know what I should like; it would be to know what he really thinks about things, to have him wait on me often, to take him travelling. But that would be all. If we were expected to love all the people who attract us, life would be pretty ghastly, wouldn�t it? It�s silly of Robert to get ideas like that. All that sort of thing, it�s only just what comes into my head, that�s all; Robert has nothing to worry about.� She was still gazing at Aim�. �Do look, what dark eyes he has. I should love to know what there is behind them.�  ���Presently came a message that Robert was waiting for her in a private room, to which he had gone to finish his luncheon, by another door, without having to pass through the restaurant again. I thus found myself alone, until I too was summoned by Robert. I found his mistress stretched out on a sofa laughing under the kisses and caresses that he was showering on her. They were drinking champagne. �Hallo, you!� she cried to him, having recently picked up this formula which seemed to her the last word in playfulness and wit. I had fed badly, I was extremely uncomfortable, and albeit Legrandin�s words had had no effect on me I was sorry to think that I was beginning in a back room of a restaurant and should be finishing in the wings of a theatre this first afternoon of spring. Looking first at the time to see that she was not making herself late, she offered me a glass of champagne, handed me one of her Turkish cigarettes and unpinned a rose for me from her bodice. Whereupon I said to myself: �I have nothing much to regret, after all; these hours spent in this young woman�s company are not wasted, since I have had from her, charming gifts which could not be bought too dear, a rose, a scented cigarette and a glass of champagne.� I told myself this because I felt that it endowed with an aesthetic character and thereby justified, saved these hours of boredom. I ought perhaps to have reflected that the very need which I felt of a reason that would console me for my boredom was sufficient to prove that I was experiencing no aesthetic sensation. As for Robert and his mistress, they appeared to have no recollection of the quarrel which had been raging between them a few minutes earlier, or of my having been a witness to it. They made no allusion to it, sought no excuse for it any more than for the contrast with it which their present conduct formed. By dint of drinking champagne with them, I began to feel a little of the intoxication that used to come over me at Rivebelle, though probably not quite the same. Not only every kind of intoxication, from that which the sun or travelling gives us to that which we get from exhaustion or wine, but every degree of intoxication � and each must have a different figure, like the numbers of fathoms on a chart � lays bare in us exactly at the depth to which it reaches a different kind of man. The room which Saint-Loup had taken was small, but the mirror which was its sole ornament was of such a kind that it seemed to reflect thirty others in an endless vista; and the electric bulb placed at the top of the frame must at night, when the light was on, followed by the procession of thirty flashes similar to its own, give to the drinker, even when alone, the idea that the surrounding space was multiplying itself simultaneously with his sensations heightened by intoxication, and that, shut up by himself in this little cell, he was reigning nevertheless over something far more extensive in its indefinite luminous curve than a passage in the Jardin de Paris. Being then myself at this moment the said drinker, suddenly, looking for him in the glass, I caught sight of him, hideous, a stranger, who was staring at me. The joy of intoxication was stronger than my disgust; from gaiety or bravado I smiled at him, and simultaneously ne smiled back at me. And I felt myself so much under the ephemeral and Potent sway of the minute in which our sensations are so strong, that I am not sure whether my sole regret was not at the thought that this hideous self of whom I had just caught sight in the glass was perhaps there for the last time on earth, and that I should never meet the stranger again in the whole course of my life.  ���Robert was annoyed only because I was not being more brilliant before his mistress.  ��� �What about that fellow you met this morning, who combines snobbery with astronomy; tell her about him, I�ve forgotten the story,� and he watched her furtively.  ��� �But, my dear boy, there�s nothing more than what you�ve just said.�  ��� �What a bore you are. Then tell her about Fran�oise in the Champs-Elys�es. She�ll enjoy that.�  ��� �Oh, do! Bobby is always talking about Fran�oise.� And taking Saint-Loup by the chin, she repeated, for want of anything more original, drawing the said chin nearer to the light: �Hallo, you!�  ���Since actors had ceased to be for me exclusively the depositaries, in their diction and playing, of an artistic truth, they had begun to interest me in themselves; I amused myself, pretending that what I saw before me were the characters in some old humorous novel, by watching, struck by the fresh face of the young man who had just come into the stalls, the heroine listen distractedly to the declaration of love which the juvenile lead in the piece was addressing to her, while he, through the fiery torrent of his impassioned speech, still kept a burning gaze fixed on an old lady seated in a stage box, whose magnificent pearls had caught his eye; and thus, thanks especially to the information that Saint-Loup gave me as to the private lives of the players, I saw another drama, mute but expressive, enacted beneath the words of the spoken drama which in itself, although of no merit, interested me also; for I could feel in it that there were budding and opening for an hour in the glare of the footlights, created out of the agglutination on the face of an actor of another face of grease paint and pasteboard, on his own human soul the words of a part.  ���These ephemeral vivid personalities which the characters are in a play that is entertaining also, whom one loves, admires, pities, whom one would like to see again after one has left the theatre, but who by that time are already disintegrated into a comedian who is no longer in the position which he occupied in the play, a text which no longer shews one the comedian�s face, a coloured powder which a handkerchief wipes off, who have returned in short to elements that contain nothing of them, since their dissolution, effected so soon after the end of the show, make us � like the dissolution of a dear friend � begin to doubt the reality of our ego and meditate on the mystery of death.  ���One number in the programme I found extremely trying. A young woman whom Rachel and some of her friends disliked was, with a set of old songs, to make a first appearance on which she had based all her hopes for the future of herself and her family. This young woman was blessed with unduly, almost grotesquely prominent hips and a pretty but too slight voice, weakened still farther by her excitement and in marked contrast to her muscular development. Rachel had posted among the audience a certain number of friends, male and female, whose business it was by their sarcastic comments to put the novice, who was known to be timid, out of countenance, to make her lose her head so that her turn should prove a complete failure, after which the manager would refuse to give her a contract. At the first notes uttered by the wretched woman, several of the male audience, recruited for that purpose, began pointing to her backward profile with jocular comments, several of the women, also in the plot, laughed out loud, each flute-like note from the stage increased the deliberate hilarity, which grew to a public scandal. The unhappy woman, sweating with anguish through her grease-paint, tried for a little longer to hold out then stopped and looked round the audience with an appealing gaze of misery and anger which succeeded only in increasing the uproar. The instinct to imitate others, the desire to shew their own wit and daring added to the party several pretty actresses who had not been forewarned but now threw at the others glances charged with malicious connivance, and sat convulsed with laughter which rang out in such violent peals that at the end of the second song, although there were still five more on the programme, the stage manager rang down the curtain. I tried to make myself pay no more heed to the incident than I had paid to my grandmother�s sufferings when my great-aunt, to tease her, used to give my grandfather brandy, the idea of deliberate wickedness being too painful for me to bear. And yet, just as our pity for misfortune is perhaps not very exact since in our imagination we recreate a whole world of grief by which the unfortunate who has to struggle against it has no time to think of being moved to self-pity, so wickedness has probably not in the mind of the wicked man that pure and voluptuous cruelty which it so pains us to imagine. Hatred inspires him, anger gives him an ardour, an activity in which there is no great joy; he must be a sadist to extract any pleasure from it; ordinarily, the wicked man supposes himself to be punishing the wickedness of his victim; Rachel imagined certainly that the actress whom she was making suffer was far from being of interest to any one, and that anyhow, in having her hissed off the stage, she was herself avenging an outrage on good taste and teaching an unworthy comrade a lesson. Nevertheless, I preferred not to speak of this incident since I had had neither the courage nor the power to prevent it, and it would have been too painful for me, by saying any good of their victim, to approximate to a gratification of the lust for cruelty the sentiments which animated the tormentors who had strangled this career in its infancy.  ���But the opening scene of this afternoon�s performance interested me in quite another way. It made me realise in part the nature of the illusion of which Saint-Loup was a victim with regard to Rachel, and which had set a gulf between the images that he and I respectively had in mind of his mistress, when we beheld her that morning among the blossoming pear trees. Rachel was playing a part which involved barely more than her walking on in the little play. But seen thus, she was another woman. She had one of those faces to which distance � and not necessarily that between stalls and stage, the world being in this respect only a larger theatre � gives form and outline and which, seen close at hand, dissolve back into dust. Standing beside her one saw only a nebula, a milky way of freckles, of tiny spots, nothing more. At a proper distance, all this ceased to be visible and, from cheeks that withdrew, were reabsorbed into her face, rose like a crescent moon a nose so fine, so pure that one would have liked to be object of Rachel�s attention, to see her again as often as one chose, to her close to one, provided that one had not already seen her differently and at close range. This was not my case but it had been Saint-Loup�s when he first saw her on the stage. Then he had asked himself how he might approach her, how come to know her, there had opened in him a whole fairy realm � that in which she lived � from which emanated an exquisite radiance but into which he might not penetrate. He had left the theatre telling himself that it would be madness to write to her, that she would not answer his letter, quite prepared to give his fortune and his name for the creature who was living in him in a world so vastly superior to those too familiar realities, a world made beautiful by desire and dreams of happiness, when at the back of the theatre, a little old building which had itself the air of being a piece of scenery, from the stage door he saw debouch the gay and daintily hatted band of actresses who had just been playing. Young men who knew them were waiting for them outside. The number of pawns on the human chessboard being less than the number of combinations that they are capable of forming, in a theatre from which are absent all the people we know and might have expected to find, there turns up one whom we never imagined that we should see again and who appears so opportunely that the coincidence seems to us providential, although no doubt some other coincidence would have occurred in its stead had we been not in that place but in some other, where other desires would have been aroused and we should have met some other old acquaintance to help us to satisfy them. The golden portals of the world of dreams had closed again upon Rachel before Saint-Loup saw her emerge from the theatre, so that the freckles and spots were of little importance. They vexed him nevertheless, especially as, being no longer alone, he had not now the same opportunity to dream as in the theatre. But she, for all that he could no longer see her, continued to dictate his actions, like those stars which govern us by their attraction even during the hours in which they are not visible to our eyes. And so his desire for the actress with the fine features which had no place now even in Robert�s memory had the result that, dashing towards the old friend whom chance had brought to the spot, he insisted upon an introduction to the person with no features and with freckles, since she was the same person, telling himself that later on he would take care to find out which of the two this same person really was. She was in a hurry, she did not on this occasion say a single word to Saint-Loup, and it was only some days later that he finally contrived, by inducing her to leave her companions, to escort her home. He loved her already. The need for dreams, the desire to be made happy by her of whom one has dreamed, bring it about that not much time is required before one entrusts all one�s chances of happiness to her who a few days since was but a fortuitous apparition, unknown, unmeaning, upon the boards of the theatre.  ���When, the curtain having fallen, we moved on to the stage, alarmed at finding myself there for the first time, I felt the need to begin a spirited conversation with Saint-Loup. In this way my attitude, as I did not know what one ought to adopt in a setting that was strange to me, would be entirely dominated by our talk, and people would think that I was so absorbed in it, so unobservant of my surroundings, that it was quite natural that I should not shew the facial expressions proper to a place in which, to judge by what I appeared to be saying, I was barely conscious of standing; and seizing, to make a beginning, upon the first topic that came to my mind:  ��� �You know,� I said, �I did come to say good-bye to you the day I left Donci�res; I�ve not had an opportunity to mention it. I waved to you in the street.�  ��� �Don�t speak about it,� he replied, �I was so sorry. I passed you just outside the barracks, but I couldn�t stop because I was late already. I assure you, I felt quite wretched about it.�  ���So he had recognised me! I saw again in my mind the wholly impersonal salute which he had given me, raising his hand to his cap, without a glance to indicate that he knew me, without a gesture to shew that he was sorry he could not stop. Evidently this fiction, which he had adopted at that moment, of not knowing me must have simplified matters for him greatly. But I was amazed to find that he had been able to compose himself to it so swiftly and without any instinctive movement to betray his original impression. I had already observed at Balbec that, side by side with that childlike sincerity of his face, the skin of which by its transparence rendered visible the sudden tide of certain emotions, his body had been admirably trained to perform a certain number of well-bred dissimulations, and that, like a consummate actor, he could, in his regimental and in his social life, play alternately quite different parts. In one of his parts he loved me tenderly, he acted towards me almost as if he had been my brother; my brother he had been, he was now again, but for a moment that day he had been another person who did not know me and who, holding the reins, his glass screwed to his eye, without a look or a smile had lifted his disengaged hand to the peak of his cap to give me correctly the military salute.  ���The stage scenery, still in its place, among which I was passing, seen thus at close range and without the advantage of any of those effects of lighting and distance on which the eminent artist whose brush had painted it had calculated, was a depressing sight, and Rachel, when I came near her, was subjected to a no less destructive force. The curves of her charming nose had stood out in perspective, between stalls and stage, like the relief of the scenery. It was no longer herself, I recognised her only thanks to her eyes, in which her identity had taken refuge. The form, the radiance of this young star, so brilliant a moment ago, had vanished. On the other hand � as though we came close to the moon and it ceased to present the appearance of a disk of rosy gold � on this face, so smooth a surface until now, I could distinguish only protuberances, discolourations, cavities. Despite the incoherence into which were resolved at close range not only the feminine features but the painted canvas, I was glad to be there to wander among the scenery, all that setting which at one time my love of nature had prompted me to dismiss as tedious and artificial until the description of it by Goethe in Wilhelm Meister had given it a sort of beauty in my eyes; and I had already observed with delight, in the thick of a crowd of journalists or men of friends of the actresses, who were greeting one another, talking, smoking, as though in a public thoroughfare, a young man in a black velvet cap and hortensia-coloured skirt, his cheeks chalked in red like a page from a Watteau album, who with his smiling lips, his eyes raised to the ceiling, as he sprang lightly into the air, seemed so entirely of another species than the rational folk in everyday clothes, in the midst of whom he was pursuing like a madman the course of his ecstatic dream, so alien to the preoccupations of their life, so anterior to the habits of their civilisation, so enfranchised from all the laws of nature, that it was as restful and as fresh a spectacle as watching a butterfly straying along a crowded street to follow with one�s eyes, between the strips of canvas, the natural arabesques traced by his winged capricious painted oscillations. But at that moment Saint-Loup conceived the idea that his mistress was paying undue attention to this dancer, who was engaged now in practising for the last time the figure of fun with which he was going to take the stage, and his face darkened.  ��� �You might look the other way,� he warned her gloomily. �You know that none of those dancer-fellows is worth the rope they can at least fall off and break their necks, and they�re the sort of people who go about afterwards boasting that you�ve taken notice of them. Besides, you know very well you�ve been told to go to your dressing-room and change. You�ll be missing your call again.�  ���A group of men � journalists � noticing the look of fury on Saint-Loup�s face, came nearer, amused, to listen to what we were saying. And as the stage-hands had just set up some scenery on our other side we were forced into close contact with them.  ��� �Oh, but I know him; he�s a friend of mine,� cried Saint-Loup�s mistress, her eyes still fixed on the dancer. �Look how well made he is, do watch those little hands of his dancing away by themselves like his whole body!�  ���The dancer turned his head towards her, and his human person appeared beneath the sylph that he was endeavouring to be, the clear grey jelly of his eyes trembled and sparkled between eyelids stiff with paint, and a smile extended the corners of his mouth into cheeks plastered with rouge; then, to amuse the girl, like a singer who hums to oblige us the air of the song in which we have told her that we admired her singing, he began to repeat the movement of his hands, counterfeiting himself with the fineness of a parodist and the good humour of a child.  ��� �Oh, that�s too lovely, the way he copies himself,� she cried, clapping her hands.  ��� �I implore you, my dearest girl,� Saint-Loup broke in, in a tone of utter misery, �do not make a scene here, I can�t stand it; I swear, if you say another word I won�t go with you to your room, I shall walk straight out; come, don�t be so naughty. . . . You oughtn�t to stand about in the cigar smoke like that, it�ll make you ill,� he went on, to me, with the solicitude he had shewn for me in our Balbec days.  ��� �Oh! What a good thing it would be if you did go.�  ��� �I warn you, if I do I shan�t come back.�  ��� �That�s more than I should venture to hope.�  ��� �Listen; you know, I promised you the necklace if you behaved nicely to me, but the moment you treat me like this. . . . �  ��� �Ah! Well, that doesn�t surprise me in the least. You gave me your promise; I ought to have known you�d never keep it. You want the whole world to know you�re made of money, but I�m not a money-grubber like you. You can keep your blasted necklace; I know some one else who�ll give it to me.�  ��� �No one else can possibly give it to you; I�ve told Boucheron he�s to keep it for me, and I have his promise not to let anyone else have it.�  ��� �There you are, trying to blackmail me, you�ve arranged everything, I see. That�s what they mean by Marsantes, Mater Semita, it smells of the race,� retorted Rachel quoting an etymology which was founded on a wild misinterpretation, for Semita means �path� and not �Semite,� but one which the Nationalists applied to Saint-Loup on account of the Dreyfusard views for which, so far as that went, he was indebted to the actress. She was less entitled than anyone to apply the word �Jew� to Mme. de Marsantes, in whom the ethnologists of society could succeed in finding no trace of Judaism apart from her connexion with the L�vy-Mirepoix family. �But this isn�t the last of it, I can tell you. An agreement like that isn�t binding. You have acted treacherously towards me. Boucheron shall be told of it and he�ll be paid twice as much for his necklace. You�ll hear from me before long; don�t you worry.�  ���Robert was in the right a hundred times over. But circumstances are always so entangled that the man who is in the right a hundred times may have been once in the wrong. And I could not help recalling that unpleasant and yet quite innocent expression which he had used at Balbec: �In that way I keep a hold over her.�  ��� �You don�t understand what I mean about the necklace. I made no formal promise: once you start doing everything you possibly can to make me leave you, it�s only natural, surely, that I shouldn�t give it to you; I fail to understand what treachery you can see in that, or what my ulterior motive is supposed to be. You can�t seriously maintain that I brag about my money, I�m always telling you that I�m only a poor devil without a cent to my name. It�s foolish of you take it in that way, my dear. What possible interest can I have in hurting you? You know very well that my one interest in life is yourself.�  ��� �Oh, yes, yes, please go on,� she retorted ironically, with the sweeping gesture of a barber wielding his razor. And turning to watch the dancer:  ��� �Isn�t he too wonderful with his hands. A woman like me couldn�t do the things he�s doing now.� She went closer to him and, pointing to Robert�s furious face: �Look, he�s hurt,� she murmured, in the momentary elation of a sadic impulse to cruelty totally out of keeping with the genuine feelings of affection for Saint-Loup.  ��� �Listen, for the last time, I swear to you it doesn�t matter what you do � in a week you�ll be giving anything to get me back � I shan�t come; it�s a clean cut, do you hear, it�s irrevocable; you will be sorry one day, when it�s too late.�  ���Perhaps he was sincere in saying this, and the torture of leaving his mistress may have seemed to him less cruel than that of remaining with her in certain circumstances.  ��� �But, my dear boy,� he went on, to me, �you oughtn�t to stand about here, I tell you, it will make you cough.�  ���I pointed to the scenery which barred my way. He touched his hat and said to one of the journalists:  ��� �Would you mind, sir, throwing away your cigar; the smoke is bad for my friend.�  ���His mistress had not waited for him to accompany her; on her way to her dressing-room she turned round and:  ��� �Do they do those tricks with women too, those nice little hands?� she flung to the dancer from the back of the stage, in an artificially melodious tone of girlish innocence. �You look just like one yourself, I�m sure I could have a wonderful time with you and a girl I know.�  ��� �There�s no rule against smoking that I know of; if people aren�t well, they have only to stay at home,� said the journalist.  ���The dancer smiled mysteriously back at the actress.  ��� �Oh! Do stop! You�ll make me quite mad,� she cried to him. �Then there will be trouble.�  ��� �In any case, sir, you are not very civil,� observed Saint-Loup to the journalist, still with a courteous suavity, in the deliberate manner of a man judging retrospectively the rights and wrongs of an incident that is already closed.  ���At that moment I saw Saint-Loup raise his arm vertically above his head as if he had been making a signal to some one whom I could not see, or like the conductor of an orchestra, and indeed � without any greater transition than when, at a simple wave of the baton, in a symphony or a ballet, violent rhythms succeed a graceful andante � after the courteous words that he had just uttered he brought down his hand with a resounding smack upon the journalist�s cheek.  ���Now that to the measured conversations of the diplomats, to the smiling arts of peace had succeeded the furious onthrust of war, since blows lead to blows, I should not have been surprised to see the combatants swimming in one another�s blood. But what I could not understand (like people who feel that it is not according to the rules when a war breaks out between two countries after some question merely of the rectification of a frontier, or when a sick man dies after nothing more serious than a swelling of the liver) was how Saint-Loup had contrived to follow up those words, which implied a distinct shade of friendliness, with an action which in no way arose out of them, which they had not, so to speak, announced, that action of an arm raised in defiance not only of the rights of man but of the law of cause and effect, that action created ex nihilo. Fortunately the journalist who, staggering back from the violence of the blow, had turned pale and hesitated for a moment, did not retaliate. As for his friends, one of them had promptly turned away his head and was looking fixedly into the wings for some one who evidently was not there; the second pretended that a speck of dust had got into his eye, and began rubbing and squeezing his eyelid with every sign of being in pain; while the third had rushed off, exclaiming: �Good heavens, I believe the curtain�s going up; we shan�t get into our seats.�  ���I wanted to speak to Saint-Loup, but he was so full of his indignation with the dancer that it adhered exactly to the surface of his eyeballs; like a subcutaneous structure it distended his cheeks with the result that, his internal agitation expressing itself externally in an entire immobility, he had not even the power of relaxation, the �play� necessary to take in a word from me and to answer it. The journalist�s friends, seeing that the incident was at an end, gathered round him again, still trembling. But, ashamed of having deserted him, they were absolutely determined that be should be made to suppose that they had noticed nothing. And so they dilated, one upon the speck of dust in his eye, one upon his false alarm when he had thought that the curtain was going up, the third upon the astonishing resemblance between a man who had just gone by and the speaker�s brother. Indeed they seemed quite to resent their friend�s not having shared their several emotions.  ��� �What, didn�t it strike you? You must be going blind.�  ��� �What I say is that you�re a pack of curs,� growled the journalist whom Saint-Loup had punished.  ���Forgetting the poses they had adopted, to be consistent with which they ought � but they did not think of it � to have pretended not to understand what he meant, they fell back on certain expressions traditional in the circumstances: �What�s all the excitement? Keep your hair on, old chap. Don�t take the bit in your teeth.�  ���I had realised that morning beneath the pear blossom how illusory were the grounds upon which Robert�s love for �Rachel when from the Lord� was based; I was bound now to admit how very real were the sufferings to which that love gave rise. Gradually the feeling that had obsessed him for the last hour, without a break, began to diminish, receded into him, an unoccupied pliable zone appeared in his eyes. I had stopped for a moment at a corner of the Avenue Gabriel from which I had often in the past seen Gilberte appear. I tried for a few seconds to recall those distant impressions, and was hurrying at a �gymnastic� pace to overtake Saint-Loup when I saw that a gentleman, somewhat shabbily attired, appeared to be talking to him confidentially. I concluded that this was a personal friend of Robert; at the same time they seemed to be drawing even closer to one another; suddenly, as a meteor flashes through the sky, I saw a number of ovoid bodies assume with a giddy swiftness all the positions necessary for them to form, before Saint-Loup�s face and body, a flickering constellation. Flung out like stones from a catapult, they seemed to me to be at the very least seven in number. They were merely, however, Saint-Loup�s pair of fists, multiplied by the speed with which they were changing their places in this � to all appearance ideal and decorative � arrangement. But this elaborate display was nothing more than a pummelling which Saint-Loup was administering, the true character of which, aggressive rather than aesthetic, was first revealed to me by the aspect of the shabbily dressed gentleman who appeared to be losing at once his self-possession, his lower jaw and a quantity of blood. He gave fictitious explanations to the people who came up to question him, turned his head and, seeing that Saint-Loup had made off and was hastening to rejoin me, stood gazing after him with an offended, crushed, but by no means furious expression on his face. Saint-Loup, on the other hand, was furious, although he himself had received no blow, and his eyes were still blazing with anger when he reached me. The incident was in no way connected (as I had supposed) with the assault in the theatre. It was an impassioned loiterer who, seeing the fine looking young soldier that Saint-Loup was, had made overtures to him. My friend could not get over the audacity of this �clique� who no longer even waited for the shades of night to cover their operations, and spoke of the suggestion that had been made to him with the same indignation as the newspapers use in reporting an armed assault and robbery, in broad daylight, in the centre of Paris. And yet the recipient of his blow was excusable in one respect, for the trend of the downward slope brings desire so rapidly to the point of enjoyment that beauty by itself appears to imply consent. Now, that Saint-Loup was beautiful was beyond dispute. Castigation such as he had just administered has this value, for men of the type that had accosted him, that it makes them think seriously of their conduct, though never for long enough to enable them to amend their ways and thus escape correction at the hands of the law. And so, although Saint-Loup�s arm had shot out instinctively, without any preliminary thought, all such punishments, even when they reinforce the law, are powerless to bring about any uniformity in morals.  ���These incidents, particularly the one that was weighing most on his mind, seemed to have prompted in Robert a desire to be left alone for a while. After a moment�s silence he asked me to leave him, and to go by myself to call on Mme. de Villeparisis. He would join me there, but preferred that we should not enter the room together, so that he might appear to have only just arrived in Paris, instead of having spent half the day already with me.  ���As I had supposed before making the acquaintance of Mme. de Villeparisis at Balbec, there was a vast difference between the world in which she lived and that of Mme. de Guermantes. Mme. de Villeparisis was one of those women who, born of a famous house, entering by marriage into another no less famous, do not for all that enjoy any great position in the social world, and, apart from a few duchesses who are their nieces or sisters-in-law, perhaps even a crowned head or two, old family friends, see their drawing-rooms filled only by third-rate people, drawn from the middle classes or from a nobility either provincial or tainted in some way, whose presence there has long since driven away all such smart and snobbish folk as are not obliged to come to the house by ties of blood or the claims of a friendship too old to be ignored. Certainly I had no difficulty after the first few minutes in understanding how Mme. de Villeparisis, at Balbec, had come to be so well informed, better than ourselves even, as to the smallest details of the tour through Spain which my father was then making with M. de Norpois. Even this, however, did not make it possible to rest content with the theory that the intimacy � of more than twenty years� standing � between Mme. de Villeparisis and the Ambassador could have been responsible for the lady�s loss of caste in a world where the smartest women boasted the attachment of lovers far less respectable than he not to mention that it was probably years since he had been anything more to the Marquise than just an old friend. Had Mme. de Villeparisis then had other adventures in days gone by? Being then of a more passionate temperament than now, in a calm and religious old age which nevertheless owed some of its mellow colouring to those ardent, vanished years, had she somehow failed, in the country neighbourhood where she had lived for so long, to avoid certain scandals unknown to the younger generation who simply took note of their effect in the unequal and defective composition of a visiting list bound, otherwise, to have been among the purest of any taint of mediocrity? That �sharp tongue� which her nephew ascribed to her, had it in those far-off days made her enemies? Had it driven her into taking advantage of certain successes with men so as to avenge herself upon women? All this was possible; nor could the exquisitely sensitive way in which � giving so delicate a shade not merely to her words but to her intonation � Mme. de Villeparisis spoke of modesty or generosity be held to invalidate this supposition; for the people who not only speak with approval of certain virtues but actually feel their charm and shew a marvellous comprehension of them (people in fact who will, when they come to write their memoirs, present a worthy picture of those virtues) are often sprung from but not actually part of the silent, simple, artless generation which practised them. That generation is reflected in them but is not continued. Instead of the character which it possessed we find a sensibility, an intelligence which are not conducive to action. And whether or not there had been in the life of Mme. de Villeparisis any of those scandals, which (if there had) the lustre of her name would have blotted out, it was this intellect, resembling rather that of a writer of the second order than that of a woman of position, that was undoubtedly the cause of her social degradation.  ���It is true that they were not specially elevating, the qualities, such as balance and restraint, which Mme. de Villeparisis chiefly extolled; but to speak of restraint in a manner that shall be entirely adequate, the word �restraint� is not enough, we require some of the qualities of authorship which presuppose a quite unrestrained exaltation; I had remarked at Balbec that the genius of certain great artists was completely unintelligible to Mme. de Villeparisis; and that all she could do was to make delicate fun of them and to express her incomprehension in a graceful and witty form. But this wit and grace, at the point to which she carried them, became themselves � on another plane, and even although they were employed to belittle the noblest masterpieces � true artistic qualities. Now the effect of such qualities on any social position is a morbid activity of the kind which doctors call elective, and so disintegrating that the most firmly established pillars of society are hard put to it to hold out for any length of time. What artists call intellect seems pure presumption to the fashionable world which, unable to place itself at the sole point of view from which they, the artists, look at and judge things, incapable of understanding the particular attraction to which they yield when they choose an ex-Pression or start a friendship, feel in their company an exhaustion, an irritation, from which antipathy very shortly springs. And yet in her conversation, and the same may be said of the Memoirs which she afterwards published, Mme. de Villeparisis shewed nothing but a sort of grace that was eminently social. Having passed by great works without mastering sometimes without even noticing them, she had preserved from the period in which she had lived and which, moreover, she described with great aptness and charm, little more than the most frivolous of the gifts that they had had to offer her. But a narrative of this sort, even when it treats exclusively of subjects that are not intellectual, is still a work of the intellect, and to give in a book or in conversation, which is almost the same thing, a deliberate impression of frivolity, a serious touch is required which a purely frivolous person would be incapable of supplying. In a certain book of reminiscences written by a woman and regarded as a masterpiece, the phrase that people quote as a model of airy grace has always made me suspect that, in order to arrive at such a pitch of lightness, the author must originally have had a rather stodgy education, a boring culture, and that as a girl she probably appeared to her friends an insufferable prig. And between certain literary qualities and social failure the connexion is so inevitable that when we open Mme. de Villeparisis�s Memoirs to-day, on any page a fitting epithet, a sequence of metaphors will suffice to enable the reader to reconstruct the deep but icy bow which must have been bestowed on the old Marquise on the staircases of the Embassies by a snob like Mme. Leroi, who perhaps may have left a card on her when she went to call on the Guermantes, but never set foot in her house for fear of losing caste among all the doctors� or solicitors� wives whom she would find there. A bluestocking Mme. de Villeparisis had perhaps been in her earliest youth, and, intoxicated with the ferment of her own knowledge, had perhaps failed to realise the. importance of not applying to people in society, less intelligent and less educated than herself, those cutting strokes which the injured party never forgets.  ���Moreover, talent is not a separate appendage which one artificially attaches to those qualities which make for social success, in order to create from the whole what people in society call a �complete woman.� It is the living product of a certain moral complexion, from which as a rule many moral qualities are lacking and in which there predominates a sensibility of which other manifestations such as we do not notice in a book may make themselves quite distinctly felt in the course of a life, certain curiosities for instance, certain whims, the desire to go to this place or that for one�s own amusement and not with a view to the extension, the maintenance or even the mere exercise of one�s social relations. I had seen at Balbec Mme. de Villeparisis hemmed in by a bodyguard of her own servants without even a glance, as she passed, at the people sitting in the hall of the hotel. But I had had a presentiment that this abstention was due not to indifference, and it seemed that she had not always confined herself to it. She would get a sudden craze to know some one or other because she had seen him and thought him good-looking, or merely because she had been told that he was amusing, or because he had struck her as different from the people she knew, who at this period, when she had not yet begun to appreciate them because she imagined that they would never fail her, belonged, all of them, to the purest cream of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. To the bohemian, the humble middle-class gentleman whom she had marked out with her favour she was obliged to address invitations the importance of which he was unable to appreciate, with an insistence which began gradually to depreciate her in the eyes of the snobs who were in the habit of estimating the smartness of a house by the people whom its mistress excluded rather than by those whom she entertained. Certainly, if at a given moment in her youth Mme. de Villeparisis, surfeited with the satisfaction of belonging to the fine flower of the aristocracy, had found a sort of amusement in scandalising the people among whom she lived, and in deliberately impairing her own position in society, she had begun to attach its full importance to that position once it was definitely lost. She had wished to shew the Duchesses that she was better than they, by saying and doing all the things that they dared not say or do. But now that they all, save such as were closely related to her, had ceased to call, she felt herself diminished, and sought once more to reign, but with another sceptre than that of wit. She would have liked to attract to her house all those women whom she had taken such pains to drive away. How many women�s lives, lives of which little enough is known (for we all live in different worlds according to our ages, and the discretion of their elders prevents the young from forming any clear idea of the past and so completing the cycle), have been divided in this way into contrasted periods, the last being entirely devoted to the reconquest of what in the second has been so light-heartedly flung on the wind. Flung on the wind in what way? The young people are all the less capable of imagining it, since they see before them an elderly and respectable Marquise de Villeparisis and have no idea that the grave diarist of the present day, so dignified beneath her pile of snowy hair, can ever have been a gay midnight-reveller who was perhaps the delight in those days, devoured the fortunes perhaps of men now sleeping in their graves; that she should also have set to work, with a persevering and natural industry, to destroy the position which she owed to her high birth does not in the least imply that even at that remote period Mme. de Villeparisis did not attach great importance to her position. In the same way the web of isolation, of inactivity in which a neurasthenic lives may be woven by him from morning to night without therefore seeming endurable, and while he is hastening to add another mesh to the net which holds him captive, it is possible that he is dreaming only of dancing, sport and travel. We are at work every moment upon giving its form to our life, but we do so by copying unintentionally, like the example in a book, the features of the person that we are and not of him who we should like to be. The disdainful bow of Mme. Leroi might to some extent be expressive of the true nature of Mme. de Villeparisis; it in no way corresponded to her ambition.  ���No doubt at the same moment at which Mme. Leroi was � to use an expression beloved of Mme. Swann ��cutting� the Marquise, the latter could seek consolation in remembering how Queen Marie-Am�lie had once said to her: �You are just like a daughter to me.� But such marks of royal friendship, secret and unknown to the world, existed for the Marquise alone, dusty as the diploma of an old Conservatoire medalist. The only true social advantages are those that create life, that can disappear without the person who has benefited by them needing to try to keep them or to make them public, because on the same day a hundred others will take their place. And for all that she could remember the Queen�s using those words to her, she would nevertheless have bartered them gladly for the permanent faculty of being asked everywhere which Mme. Leroi possessed as in a restaurant a great but unknown artist whose genius is written neither in the lines of his bashful face nor in the antiquated cut of his threadbare coat, would willingly be even the young stock-jobber, of the lowest grade of society, who is sitting with a couple of actresses at a neighbouring table to which in an obsequious and incessant chain come hurrying manager, head waiter, pages and even the scullions who file out of the kitchen to salute him, as in the fairy-tales, while the wine waiter advances, dust-covered like his bottles, limping and dazed, as if on his way up from the cellar he had twisted his foot before emerging into the light of day.  ���It must be remarked, however, that in Mme. de Villeparisis�s drawing-room the absence of Mme. Leroi, if it distressed the lady of the house, passed unperceived by the majority of her guests. They were entirely ignorant of the peculiar position which Mme. Leroi occupied, a: position known only to the fashionable world, and never doubted that Mme. de Villeparisis�s receptions were, as the readers of her Memoirs to-day are convinced that they must have been, the most brilliant in Paris.  ���On the occasion of this first call which, after leaving Saint-Loup, I went to pay on Mme. Villeparisis, following the advice given by M. de Norpois to my father, I found her in her drawing-room hung with yellow silk, against which the sofas and the admirable armchairs upholstered in Beauvais tapestry stood out with the almost purple redness of ripe raspberries. Side by side with the Guermantes and Villeparisis portraits one saw those � gifts from the sitters themselves � of Queen Marie-Am�lie, the Queen of the Belgians, the Prince de Joinville and the Empress of Austria. Mme. de Villeparisis herself, capped with an old-fashioned bonnet of black lace (which she preserved with the same instinctive sense of local or historical colour as a Breton inn-keeper who, however Parisian his customers may have become, feels it more in keeping to make his maids dress in coifs and wide sleeves), was seated at a little desk on which in front of her, as well as her brushes, her palette and an unfinished flower-piece in water-colours, were arranged in glasses, in saucers, in cups, moss-roses, zinnias, maidenhair ferns, which on account of the sudden influx of callers she had just left off painting, and which had the effect of being piled on a florist�s counter in some eighteenth-century mezzotint. In this drawing-room, which had been slightly heated on purpose because the Marquise had caught cold on the journey from her house in the country, there were already when I arrived a librarian with whom Mme. de Villeparisis had spent the morning in selecting the autograph letters to herself from various historical personages which were to figure in facsimile as documentary evidence in the Memoirs which she was preparing for the press, and a historian, solemn and tongue-tied, who hearing that she had inherited and still possessed a portrait of the Duchesse de Montmorency, had come to ask her permission to reproduce it as a plate in his work on the Fronde; a party strengthened presently by the addition of my old friend Bloch, now a rising dramatist, upon whom she counted to secure the gratuitous services of actors and actresses at her next series of afternoon parties. It was true that the social kaleidoscope was in the act of turning and that the Dreyfus case was shortly to hurl the Jews down to the lowest rung of the social ladder. But, for one thing, the anti-Dreyfus cyclone might rage as it would, it is not in the first hour of a storm that the waves are highest. In the second place, Mme. de Villeparisis, leaving a whole section of her family to fulminate against the Jews, had hitherto kept herself entirely aloof from the Case and never gave it a thought. Lastly, a young man like Bloch, whom no one knew, might pass unperceived, whereas leading Jews, representatives of their party, were already threatened. He had his chin pointed now by a goat-beard, wore double glasses and a long frock coat, and carried a glove like a roll of papyrus in his hand. The Rumanians, the Egyptians, the Turks may hate the Jews. But in a French drawing-room the differences between those peoples are not so apparent, and an Israelite making his entry as though he were emerging from the heart of the desert, his body crouching like a hyaena�s, his neck thrust obliquely forward, spreading himself in profound �salaams,� completely satisfies a certain taste for the oriental. Only it is essential that the Jew should not be actually �in� society, otherwise he will readily assume the aspect of a lord and his manners become so Gallicised that on his face a rebellious nose, growing like a nasturtium in any but the right direction, will make one think rather of Mascarille�s nose than of Solomon�s. But Bloch, not having been rendered supple by the gymnastics of the Faubourg, nor ennobled by a crossing with England or Spain, remained for a lover of the exotic as strange and savoury a spectacle, in spite of his European costume, as one of Decamps�s Jews. Marvellous racial power which from the dawn of time thrusts to the surface, even in modern Paris, on the stage of our theatres, behind the pigeonholes of our public offices, at a funeral, in the street, a solid phalanx, setting their mark upon our modern ways of hairdressing, absorbing, making us forget, disciplining the frock coat which on them remains not at all unlike the garment in which Assyrian scribes are depicted in ceremonial attire on the frieze of a monument at Susa before the gates of the Palace of Darius. (Later in the afternoon Bloch might have imagined that it was out of anti-semitic malice that M. de Charlus inquired whether his first name was Jewish, whereas it was simply from aesthetic interest and love of local colour.) But, to revert for a moment, when we speak of racial persistence we do not accurately convey the impression we receive from Jews, Greeks, Persians, all those peoples whom it is better to leave with their differences. We know from classical paintings the faces of the ancient Greeks, we have seen Assyrians on the walls of a palace at Susa. And so we feel, on encountering in a Paris drawing-room Orientals belonging to one or another group, that we are in the presence of creatures whom the forces of necromancy must have called to life. We knew hitherto only a superficial image; behold it has gained depth, it extends into three dimensions, it moves. The young Greek lady, daughter of a rich banker and the latest favourite of society, looks exactly like one of those dancers who in the chorus of a ballet at once historical and aesthetic symbolise in flesh and blood the art of Hellas; and yet in the theatre the setting makes these images somehow trite; the spectacle, on the other hand, to which the entry into a drawing-room of a Turkish lady or a Jewish gentleman admits us, by animating their features makes them appear stranger still, as if they really were creatures evoked by the effort of a medium. It is the soul (or rather the pigmy thing to which � up to the present, at any rate � the soul is reduced in this sort of materialisation), it is the soul of which we have caught glimpses hitherto in museums alone, the soul of the ancient Greeks, of the ancient Hebrews, torn from a life at once insignificant and transcendental, which seems to be enacting before our eyes this disconcerting pantomime. In the young Greek lady who is leaving the room what we seek in vain to embrace is the figure admired long ago on the side of a vase. I felt that if I had in the light of Mme. de Villeparisis�s drawing-room taken photographs of Bloch, they would have furnished of Israel the same image � so disturbing because it does not appear to emanate from humanity, so deceiving because all the same it is so strangely like humanity � which we find in spirit photographs. There is nothing, to speak more generally, not even the insignificance of the remarks made by the people among whom we spend our lives, that does not give us a sense of the supernatural, in our everyday world where even a man of genius from whom we expect, gathered as though around a turning-table, to learn the secret of the Infinite utters only these words � the same that had just issued from the lips of Bloch: �Take care of my top hat.�  ��� �Oh, Ministers, my dear sir,� Mme. de Villeparisis was saying, addressing herself specially to my friend, and picking up the thread of a conversation which had been broken by my arrival: �nobody ever wanted to see them. I was only a child at the time, but I can remember so well the King begging my grandfather to invite M. Decazes to a rout at which my father was to dance with the Duchesse de Berry. �It will give me pleasure, Florimond,� said the King. My grandfather, who was a little deaf, thought he had said M. de Castries, which seemed a perfectly natural thing to ask. When he understood that it was M. Decazes, he was furious at first, but he gave in, and wrote a note the same evening to M. Decazes, begging him to pay my grandfather the compliment and give him the honour of his presence at the ball which he was giving the following week. For we were polite, sir, in those days, and no hostess would have dreamed of simply sending her card and writing on it �Tea� or �Dancing� or �Music.� But if we understood politeness we were not incapable of impertinence either. M. Decazes accepted, but the day before the ball it was given out that my grandfather felt indisposed and had cancelled his invitations. He had obeyed the King, but he had not had M. Decazes at his ball. . . . Yes, sir, I remember M. Mole very well, he was a clever man � he shewed that in his reception of M. de Vigny at the Academy � but he was very pompous, and I can see him now coming downstairs to dinner in his own house with his tall hat in his hand.�  ��� �Ah! that is typically suggestive of what must have been a pretty perniciously philistine epoch, for it was no doubt a universal habit to carry one�s hat in one�s hand in one�s own house,� observed Bloch, anxious to make the most of so rare an opportunity of learning from an eyewitness details of the aristocratic life of another day, while the librarian, who was a sort of intermittent secretary to the Marquise, gazed at her tenderly as though he were saying to the rest of us: �There, you see what she�s like, she knows everything, she has met everybody, you can ask her anything you like, she�s quite amazing.�  ��� �Oh, dear, no,� replied Mme. de Villeparisis, drawing nearer to her as she spoke the glass containing the maidenhair which presently she would begin again to paint, �it was a habit M. Mole had; that was all. I never saw my father carry his hat in the house, except of course when the King came, because the King being at home wherever he is the master of the house is only a visitor then in his own drawing-room.�  ��� �Aristotle tells us in the second chapter of . . . � ventured M. Pierre, the historian of the Fronde, but so timidly that no one paid any attention. Having been suffering for some weeks from a nervous insomnia which resisted every attempt at treatment, he had given up going to bed, and, half-dead with exhaustion, went out only whenever his work made it imperative. Incapable of repeating at all often these expeditions which, simple enough for other people, cost him as much effort as if, to make them, he was obliged to come down from the moon, he was surprised to be brought up so frequently against the fact that other people�s lives were not organised on a constant and permanent basis so as to furnish the maximum utility to the sudden outbursts of his own. He sometimes found the doors shut of a library which he had reached only after setting himself artificially on his feet and in a frock coat like some automaton in a story by Mr. Wells. Fortunately he had found Mme. de Villeparisis at home and was going to be shewn the portrait.  ���Meanwhile he was cut short by Bloch. �Indeed,� the latter remarked, referring to what Mme. de Villeparisis had said as to the etiquette for royal visits. �Do you know, I never knew that,� as though it were strange that he should not have known it always.  ��� �Talking of that sort of visit, you heard the stupid joke my nephew Basin played on me yesterday morning?� Mme. de Villeparisis asked the librarian. �He told my people, instead of announcing him, to say that it was the Queen of Sweden who had called to see me.�  ��� �What! He made them tell you just like that! I say, he must have a nerve,� exclaimed Bloch with a shout of laughter, while the historian smiled with a stately timidity.  ��� �I was quite surprised, because I had only been back from the country a few days; I had specially arranged, just to be left in peace for a little, that no one was to be told that I was in Paris, and I asked myself how the Queen of Sweden could have heard so soon,� went on Mme. de Villeparisis, leaving her guests amazed to find that a visit from the Queen of Sweden was in itself nothing out of the common to their hostess.  ���Earlier in the day Mme. de Villeparisis might have been collaborating with the librarian in arranging the illustrations to her Memoirs; now she was, quite unconsciously, trying their effect on an average public typical of that from which she would eventually have to enlist her readers. Hers might be different in many ways from a really fashionable drawing-room in which you would have been struck by the absence of a number of middle dass ladies to whom Mme. de Villeparisis was �at home,� and would have noticed instead such brilliant leaders of fashion as Mme. Leroi had in course of time managed to secure, but this distinction is not perceptible in her Memoirs, from which certain unimportant friendships of the author have disappeared because there is never any occasion to refer to them; while the absence of those who did not come to see her leaves no gap because, in the necessarily restricted space at the author�s disposal, only a few persons can appear, and if these persons are royal personages, historic personalities, then the utmost impression of distinction which any volume of memoirs can convey to the public is achieved. In the opinion of Mme. Leroi, Mme. de Villeparisis�s parties were third-rate; and Mme. de Villeparisis felt the sting of Mme. Leroi�s opinion. But hardly anyone to-day remembers who Mme. Leroi was, her opinions have vanished into thin air, and it is the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, frequented as it was by the Queen of Sweden, and as it had been by the Due d�Aumale, the Duc de Broglie, Thiers, Montalembert, Mgr. Dupanloup, which will be looked upon as one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century by that posterity which has not changed since the days of Homer and Pindar, and for which the enviable things are exalted birth, royal or quasi-royal, and the friendship of kings, the leaders of the people and other eminent men.  ���Now of all this Mme. de Villeparisis had her share in the people who still came to her house and in the memories � sometimes slightly �touched up�� by means of which she extended her social activity into the past. And then there was M. de Norpois who, while unable to restore his friend to any substantial position in society, did indeed bring to her house such foreign or French statesmen as might have need of his services and knew that the only effective method of securing them was to pay court to Mme. de Villeparisis. Possibly Mme. Leroi also knew these European celebrities. But, as a well-mannered woman who avoids anything that suggests the bluestocking, she would as little have thought of mentioning the Eastern question to her Prime Ministers as of discussing the nature of love with her novelists and philosophers. �Love?� she had once replied to a pushing lady who had asked her: �What are your views on love?���Love? I make it, constantly, but I never talk about it.� When she had any of these literary or political lions in her house she contented herself, as did the Duchesse de Guermantes, with setting them down to play poker. They often preferred this to the serious conversations on general ideas in which Mme. de Villeparisis forced them to engage. But these conversations, ridiculous as in the social sense they may have been, have furnished the Memoirs of Mme. de Villeparisis with those admirable passages, those dissertations on politics which read so well in volumes of autobiography, as they do in Corneille�s tragedies. Furthermore, the parties of the Villeparisis of this world are alone destined to be handed down to posterity, because the rerois of this world cannot write, and, if they could, would not have the time. And if the literary bent of the Villeparisis is the cause of the Lerois� disdain, the disdain of the Lerois does, in its turn, a singular service to the literary bent of the Villeparisis by affording the bluestockings that leisure which the career of letters requires. God, Whose Will it is that there should be a few books in the world well written, breathes with that purpose such disdain into the hearts of the Lerois, for He knows that if these should invite the Villeparisis to dinner the latter would at once rise from their writing tables and order their carriages to be round at eight.  ���Presently there came into the room, with slow and solemn step, an oid lady of tall stature who, beneath the raised brim of her straw hat, revealed a monumental pile of snowy hair in the style of Marie-Antoinette. I did not then know that she was one of three women who were still to be seen in Parisian society and who, like Mme. de Villeparisis, while all of the noblest birth, had been reduced, for reasons which were IKJW lost in the night of time and could have been told us only by some old gallant of their period, to entertaining only certain of the dregs of society who were not sought after elsewhere. Each of these ladies had her own �Duchesse de Guermantes,� the brilliant niece who came regularly to pay her respects, but none of them could have succeeded in attracting to her house the �Duchesse de Guermantes� of either of the others. Mme. de Villeparisis was on the best of terms with these three ladies, but she did not like them. Perhaps the similarity between their social position and her own gave her an impression of them which was not pleasing. Besides, soured bluestockings as they were, seeking by the number and frequency of the drawing-room comedies which they arranged in their houses to give themselves the illusion of a regular salon, there had grown up among them a rivalry which the decay of her fortune in the course of a somewhat tempestuous existence reduced for each of them, when it was a question of securing the kind assistance of a professional actor or actress, into a sort of struggle for life. Furthermore, the lady with the Mark-Antoinette hair, whenever she set eyes on Mme. de Villeparisis, could not help being reminded of the fact that the Duchesse de Guermantes did not come to her Fridays. Her consolation was that at these same Fridays she could always count on having, blood being thicker than water, the Princesse de Poix, who was her own personal Guermantes, and who never went near Mme. de Villeparisis, albeit Mme. de Poix was an intimate friend of the Duchess.  ���Nevertheless from the mansion on the Quai Malaquais to the drawing-rooms of the Rue de Tournon, the Rue de la Chaise and the Faubourg Saint-Honor�, a bond as compelling as it was hateful united the three fallen goddesses, as to whom I would fain have learned by searching in some dictionary of social mythology through what gallant adventure, what sacrilegious presumption, they had incurred their punishment. Their common brilliance of origin, the common decay of their present state entered largely, no doubt, into the necessity which compelled them, while hating one another, to frequent one another�s society. Besides, each of them found in the others a convenient way of being polite to her own guests. How should these fail to suppose that they had scaled the most inaccessible peak of the Faubourg when they were introduced to a lady with a string of titles whose sister was married to a Duc de Sagan or a Prince de Ligne? Especially as there was infinitely more in the newspapers about these sham salons than about the genuine ones. Indeed these old ladies� �men about town� nephews � and Saint-Loup the foremost of them � when asked by a friend to introduce him to people, would answer at once �I will take you to see my aunt Villeparisis,� (or whichever it was) �you meet interesting people there.� They knew very well that this would mean less trouble for themselves than trying to get the said friends invited by the smart nieces or sisters-in-law of these ladies. Certain very old men and young women who had heard it from those men, told me that if these ladies were no longer received in society it was because of the extraordinary irregularity of their conduct, which, when I objected that irregular conduct was not necessarily a barrier to social success, was represented to me as having gone far beyond anything that we know to-day. The misconduct of these solemn dames who held themselves so erect assumed on the lips of those who hinted at it something that I was incapable of imagining, proportionate to the magnitude of prehistoric days, to the age of the mammoth. In a word, these three Parcae with their white or blue or red locks had spun the fatal threads of an incalculable number of gentlemen. I felt that the people of to-day exaggerated the vices of those fabulous times, like the Greeks who created Icarus, Theseus, Heracles out of men who had been but little different from those who long afterwards deified them. But one does not tabulate the sum of a person�s vices until he has almost ceased to be in a fit state to practise them, when from the magnitude of his social punishment, which is then nearing the completion of its term and which alone one can estimate, one measures, one imagines, one exaggerates that of the crime that has been committed. In that gallery of symbolical figures which is �society,� the really light women, the true Messalinas, invariably present the solemn aspect of a lady of at least seventy, with an air of lofty distinction, who entertains everyone she can but not everyone she would like to have, to whose house women will never consent to go whose own conduct falls in any way short of perfection, to whom the Pope regularly sends his Golden Rose, and who as often as not has written � on the early days of Lamartine � an essay that has been crowned by the French Academy. �How d�ye do, Alix?� Mme. de Villeparisis greeted the Marie-Antoinette lady, which lady cast a searching glance round the assembly to see whether there was not in this drawing-room any item that might be a valuable addition to her own, in which case she would have to discover it for herself, for Mme. de Villeparisis, she was sure, would be spiteful enough to try to keep it from her. Thus Mme. de Villeparisis took good care not to introduce Bloch to the old lady for fear of his being asked to produce the same play that he was arranging for her in the drawing-room of the Quai Malaquais. Besides it was only tit for tat. For, the evening before, the old lady had had Mme. Ristori, who had recited, and had taken care that Mme. de Villeparisis, from whom she had filched the Italian artist, should not hear of this function until it was over. So that she should not read it first in the newspapers and feel annoyed, the old lady had come ill nerson to tell her about it, shewing no sense of guilt. Mme. de Villeparisis, considering that an introduction of myself was not likely to have the same awkward results as that of Bloch, made me known to the Marie-Antoinette of the Quai Malaquais. The latter, who sought, by making the fewest possible movements, to preserve in her old age those lines, as of a Coysevox goddess, which had years ago charmed the young men of fashion and which spurious poets still celebrated in rhymed charades � and had acquired the habit of a lofty and compensating stiffness common to all those whom a personal degradation obliges to be continually making advances � just perceptibly lowered her head with a frigid majesty, and, turning the other way, took no more notice of me than if I had not existed. By this crafty attitude she seemed to be assuring Mme. de Villeparisis: �You see, I�m nowhere near him; please understand that I�m not interested � in any sense of the word, you old cat � in little boys.� But when, twenty minutes later, she left the room, taking advantage of the general conversation, she slipped into my ear an invitation to come to her box the following Friday with another of the three, whose high-sounding name � she had been born a Choiseul, moreover � had a prodigious effect on me.  ��� �I understand, sir, that you are thinkin� of writin� somethin� about Mme. la Duchesse de Montmorency,� said Mme. de Villeparisis to the historian of the Fronde in that grudging tone which she allowed, quite unconsciously, to spoil the effect of her great and genuine kindness, a tone due to the shrivelling crossness, the sense of grievance that is a physiological accompaniment of age, as well as to the affectation of imitating the almost rustic speech of the old nobility: �I�m goin� to let you see her portrait, the original of the copy they have in the Louvre.�  ���She rose, laying down her brushes beside the flowers, and the little apron which then came into sight at her waist, and which she wore so as not to stain her dress with paints, added still further to the impression of an old peasant given by her bonnet and her big spectacles, and offered a sharp contrast to the luxury of her appointments, the butler who had brought in the tea and cakes, the liveried footman for whom she now rang to light up the portrait of the Duchesse de Montmorency, Abbess of one of the most famous Chapters in the East of France. Everyone had risen. �What is rather amusin�,� said our hostess, �is that in these Chapters where our great-aunts were so often made Abbesses, the daughters of the King of France would not have been admitted. They were very close corporations.� �Not admit the King�s daughters,� cried Bloch in amazement, �why ever not?� �Why, because the House of France had not enough quartering after that low marriage.� Bloch�s bewilderment increased. �A low marriage? The House of France? When was that?� �Why, when they married into the Medicis,� replied Mme. de Villeparisis in the most natural manner. �It�s a fine picture, ain�t it, and in a perfect state of preservation,� she added.  ��� �My dear,� put in the Marie-Antoinette lady, �surely you remember that when I brought Liszt to see you he said that it was this one that was the copy.�  ��� �I should bow to any opinion of Liszt on music, but not on painthe Besides, he was quite off his head then, and I don�t remember his ever saying anything of the sort. But it wasn�t you that brought him here. I had met him any number of times at dinner at Princess Sayn-Wittgenstein�s.�  ���Alix�s shot had missed fire; she stood silent, erect and motionless. Plastered with layers of powder, her face had the appearance of a face of stone. And, as the profile was noble, she seemed, on a triangular and moss-grown pedestal hidden by her cape, the time-worn stucco goddess of a park.  ��� �Ah, I see another fine portrait,� began the historian.  ���The door opened and the Duchesse de Guermantes entered the room.  ��� �Well, how are you?� Mme. de Villeparisis greeted her without moving her head, taking from her apron-pocket a hand which she held out to the newcomer; and then ceasing at once to take any notice of her niece, in order to return to the historian: �That is the portrait of the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld. . . . �  ���A young servant with a bold manner and a charming face (but so finely chiselled, to ensure its perfection, that the nose was a little red and the rest of the skin slightly flushed as though they were still smarting from the recent and sculptural incision) came in bearing a card on a salver.  ��� �It is that gentleman who has been several times to see Mme. la Marquise.�  ��� �Did you tell him I was at home?�  ��� �He heard the voices.�  ��� �Oh, very well then, shew him in. It�s a man who was introduced to me,� she explained. �He told me he was very anxious to come to the house. I certainly never said he might. But here he�s taken the trouble to call five times now; it doesn�t do to hurt people�s feelings. Sir,� she went on to me, �and you, Sir,� to the historian of the Fronde, �let me introduce my niece, the Duchesse de Guermantes.�  ���The historian made a low bow, as I did also, and since he seemed to suppose that some friendly remark ought to follow this salute, his eyes brightened and he was preparing to open his mouth when he was once more frozen by the sight of Mme. de Guermantes who had taken advantage of the independence of her torso to throw it forward with an exaggerated politeness and bring it neatly back to a position of rest without letting face or eyes appear to have noticed that anyone was standing before them; after breathing a gentle sigh she contented herself with manifesting the nullity of the impression that had been made on her by the sight of the historian and myself by performing certain movements of her nostrils with a precision that testified to the absolute inertia of her unoccupied attention.  ���The importunate visitor entered the room, making straight for Mme. de Villeparisis with an ingenuous, fervent air: it was Legrandin.  ��� �Thank you so very much for letting me come and see you,� he began, laying stress on the word �very.� �It is a pleasure of a quality altogether rare and subtle that you confer on an old solitary; I assure you that its repercussion . . . � He stopped short on catching sight of me.  ��� �I was just shewing this gentleman a fine portrait of the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld, the wife of the author of the Maxims; it�s a family picture.�  ���Mme. de Guermantes meanwhile had greeted Alix, with apologies for not having been able, that year as in every previous year, to go and see her. �I hear all about you from Madeleine,� she added.  ��� �She was at luncheon with me to-day,� said the Marquise of the Quai Malaquais, with the satisfying reflexion that Mme. de Villeparisis could never say that.  ���Meanwhile I had been talking to Bloch, and fearing, from what I had been told of his father�s change of attitude towards him, that he might be envying my life, I said to him that his must be the happier of the two. My remark was prompted solely by my desire to be friendly. But such friendliness readily convinces those who cherish a high opinion of themselves of their own good fortune, or gives them a desire to convince other people. �Yes, I do lead a delightful existence,� Bloch assured me with a beatified smile. �I have three great friends; I do not wish for one more; an adorable mistress; I am infinitely happy. Rare is the mortal to whom Father Zeus accords so much felicity.� I fancy that he was anxious principally to extol himself and to make me envious. Perhaps too there was some desire to shew originality in his optimism. It was evident that he did not wish to reply in the commonplace phraseology that everybody uses: �Oh, it was nothing, really,� and so forth, when, to my question: �Was it a good show?� put with regard to an afternoon dance at his house to which I had been prevented from going, he replied in a level, careless tone, as if the dance had been given by some one else: �Why, yes, it was quite a good show, couldn�t have been better. It was really charming!�  ��� �What you have just told us interests me enormously,� said Legrandin to Mme. de Villeparisis, �for I was saying to myself only the other day that you shewed a marked likeness to him in the clear-cut turn of your speech, in a quality which I will venture to describe by two contradictory terms, monumental rapidity and immortal instantaneousness. I should have liked this afternoon to take down all the things you say; but I shall remember them. They are, in a phrase which comes, I think, from Joubert, friends of the memery. You have never read Joubert? Oh! he would have admired you so! I will take the liberty this evening of sending you a set of him, it is a privilege to make you a present of his mind. He had not your strength. But he had a great deal of charm all the same.�  ���I would have gone up to Legrandin at once and spoken to him, but he kept as far away from me as he could, no doubt in the hope that I might not overhear the stream of flattery which, with a remarkable felicity of expression, he kept pouring out, whatever the topic, to Mme. de Villeparisis.  ���She shrugged her shoulders, smiling, as though he had been trying to make fun of her, and turned to the historian.  ��� �And this is the famous Marie de Rohan, Duchesse de Chevreuse, who was married first of all to M. de Luynes.�  ��� �My dear, speaking of Mme. de Luynes reminds me of Yolande; she came to me yesterday evening, and if I had known that you weren�t engaged I�d have sent round to ask you to come. Mme. Ristori turned up quite by chance, and recited some poems by Queen Carmen Sylva in the author�s presence. It was too beautiful!�  ��� �What treachery!� thought Mme. de Villeparisis. �Of course that was what she was whispering about the other day to Mme. de Beaulaincourt and Mme. de Chaponay. I had no engagement,� she replied, �but I should not have come. I heard Ristori in her great days, she�s a mere wreck now. Besides I detest Carmen Sylva�s poetry. Ristori came here once, the Duchess of Aosta brought her, to recite a canto of the Inferno, by Dante. In that sort of thing she�s incomparable.�  ���Alix bore the blow without flinching. She remained marble. Her gaze was piercing and blank, her nose proudly arched. But the surface of one cheek was scaling. A faint, strange vegetation, green and pink, was invading her chin. Perhaps another winter would level her with the dust.  ��� �Now, sir, if you are fond of painting, look at the portrait of Mme, de Montmorency,� Mme. de Villeparisis said to Legrandin, to stop the flow of compliments which was beginning again.  ���Seizing her opportunity, while his back was turned, Mme. de Guermantes pointed to him, with an ironical, questioning look at her aunt.  ��� �It�s M. Legrandin,� murmured Mme. de Villeparisis, �he has a sister called Mme. de Cambremer, not that that conveys any more to you than it does to me.�  ��� �What! Oh, but I know her quite well!� exclaimed Mme. de Guermantes, and put her hand over her lips. �That is to say, I don�t know her, but for some reason or other Basin, who meets the husband heaven knows where, took it into his head to tell the wretched woman she might call on me. And she did. I can�t tell you what it was like. She informed me that she had been to London, and gave me a complete catalogue of all the things in the British Museum. And this very day, the moment I leave your house, I�m going, just as you see me now, to drop a card on the monster. And don�t for a moment suppose that it�s an easy thing to do. On the pretence that she�s dying of some disease she�s always at home, it doesn�t matter whether you arrive at seven at night or nine in the morning, she�s ready for you with a dish of strawberry tarts.  ��� �No, but seriously, you know, she is a monstrosity,� Mme. de Guermantes replied to a questioning glance from her aunt. �She�s an impossible person, she talks about �plumitives� and things like that.� �What does �plumitive� mean?� asked Mme. de Villeparisis. �I haven�t the slightest idea!� cried the Duchess in mock indignation. �I don�t want to know. I don�t speak that sort of language.� And seeing that her aunt really did not know what a plumitive was, to give herself the satisfaction of shewing that she was a scholar as well as a purist, and to make fun of her aunt, now, after making fun of Mme. de Cambremer: �Why, of course,� she said, with a half-laugh which the last traces of her pretended ill humour kept in check, �everybody knows what it means; a plumitive is a writer, a person who holds a pen. But it�s a dreadful word. It�s enough to make your wisdom teeth drop out. Nothing will ever make me use words like that.  ��� �And so that�s the brother, is it? I hadn�t realized that yet. But after all it�s not inconceivable. She has the same doormat docility and the same mass of information like a circulating library. She�s just as much of a flatterer as he is, and just as boring. Yes, I�m beginning to see the family likeness now quite plainly.�  ��� �Sit down, we�re just going to take a dish of tea,� said Mme. de Villeparisis to her niece. �Help yourself; you don�t want to look at the pictures of your great-grandmothers, you know them as well as I do.�  ���Presently Mme. de Villeparisis sat down again at her desk and went on with her painting. The rest of the party gathered round her, and I took the opportunity to go up to Legrandin and, seeing no harm myself in his presence in Mme. de Villeparisis�s drawing-room and never dreaming how much my words would at once hurt him and make him believe that I had deliberately intended to hurt him, say: �Well, sir, I am almost excused for coming to a tea-party when I find you here too.� M. Legrandin concluded from this speech (at least this was the opinion which he expressed of me a few days later) that I was a thoroughly spiteful little wretch who delighted only in doing mischief.  ��� �You might at least have the civility to begin by saying how d�ye do to me,� he replied, without offering me his hand and in a coarse and angry voice which I had never suspected him of possessing, a voice which bearing no traceable relation to what he ordinarily said did bear another more immediate and striking relation to something that he was feeling at the moment. What happens is that since we are determined always to keep our feelings to ourselves, we have never given any thought to the manner in which we should express them. And suddenly there is within us a strange and obscene animal making its voice heard, the tones of which may inspire as much terror in the listener who receives the involuntary elliptical irresistible communication of our defect or vice as would the sudden avowal indirectly and uncouthly proffered by a criminal who can no longer refrain from confessing a murder of which one had never imagined him to be guilty. I knew, of course, that idealism, even subjective idealism, did not prevent great philosophers from still having hearty appetites or from presenting themselves with untiring perseverance for election to the Academy. But really Legrandin had no occasion to remind people so often that he belonged to another planet when all his convulsive movements of anger or affability were governed by the desire to occupy a good position on this.  ��� �Naturally, when people pester me twenty times on end to go anywhere,� he went on in lower tones, �although I am perfectly free to do what I choose, still I can�t behave like an absolute boor.�  ���Mme. de Guermantes had sat down. Her name, accompanied as it was by her title, added to her corporeal dimensions the duchy which projected itself round about her and brought the shadowy, sun-splashed coolness of the woods of Guermantes into this drawing-room, to surround the tuffet on which she was sitting. I felt surprised only that the likeness of those woods was not more discernible on the face of the Duchess, about which there was nothing suggestive of vegetation, and at the most the ruddy discolouration of her cheeks � which ought rather, surely, to have been emblazoned with the name Guermantes � was the effect, but did not furnish a picture of long gallops in the open air. Later on, when she had ceased to interest me, I came to know many of the Duchess�s peculiarities, notably (to speak for the moment only of that one of which I already at this time felt the charm though without yet being able to discover what it was) her eyes, in which was held captive as in a picture the blue sky of an afternoon in France, broadly expansive, bathed in light even when no sun shone; and a voice which one would have thought, from its first hoarse sounds, to be almost plebeian, through which there trailed, as over the steps of the church at Combray or the pastry-cook�s in the square, the rich and lazy gold of a country sun. But on this first day I discerned nothing, the warmth of my attention volatilised at once the little that I might otherwise have been able to extract from her, in which I should have found some indication of the name Guermantes. In any case, I told myself that it was indeed she who was designated for all the world by the title Duchesse de Guermantes: the inconceivable life which that name signified, this body did indeed contain; it had just introduced that life into a crowd of different creatures, in this room which enclosed it on every side and on which it produced so violent a reaction that I thought I could see, where the extent of that mysterious life ceased, a fringe of effervescence outline its frontiers: round the circumference of the circle traced on the carpet by the balloon of her blue pekin skirt, and in the bright eyes of the Duchess at the point of intersection of the preoccupations, the memories, the incomprehensible, scornful, amused and curious thoughts which filled them from within and the outside images that were reflected on their surface. Perhaps I should have been not quite so deeply stirred had I met her at Mme. de Villeparisis�s at an evening party, instead of seeing her thus on one of the Marquise�s �days,� at one of those tea-parties which are for women no more than a brief halt in the course of their afternoon�s outing, when, keeping on the hats in which they have been driving through the streets, they waft into the close atmosphere of a drawing-room the quality of the fresh air outside, and give one a better view of Paris in the late afternoon than do the tall, open windows through which one can hear the bowling wheels of their victorias: Mme. de Guermantes wore a boating-hat trimmed with cornflowers, and what they recalled to me was not, among the tilled fields round Combray where I had so often gathered those flowers, on the slope adjoining the Tansonville hedge, the suns of bygone years; it was the scent and dust of twilight as they had been an hour ago, when Mme. de Guermantes drove through them, in the Rue de la Paix. With a smiling, disdainful, vague air, and a grimace on her pursed lips, with the point of her sunshade, as with the extreme tip of an antenna of her mysterious life, she was tracing circles on the carpet; then, with that indifferent attention which begins by eliminating every point of contact with what one is actually studying, her gaze fastened upon each of us in turn; then inspected the sofas and armchairs, but softened this time by that human sympathy which is aroused by the presence, however insignificant, of a thing one knows, a thing that is almost a person; these pieces of furniture were not like us, they belonged vaguely to her world, they were bound up with the life of her aunt; then from the Beauvais furniture her gaze was carried back to the person sitting on it, and resumed then the same air of perspicacity and that same disapproval which the respect that Mme. de Guermantes felt for her aunt would have prevented her from expressing in words, but which she would obviously have felt had she discovered on the chairs, instead of our presence, that of a spot of grease or a layer of dust.  ���That admirable writer G��-entered the room; he had come to pay a call on Mme. de Villeparisis which he regarded as a tiresome duty. The Duchess, although delighted to see him again, gave him no sign of welcome, but instinctively he made straight for her, the charm that she possessed, her tact, her simplicity making him look upon her as a woman of exceptional intelligence. He was bound, moreover, in common politeness to go and talk to her, for, since he was a pleasant and a distinguished man, Mme. de Guermantes frequently invited him to luncheon even when there were only her husband and herself besides, or in the autumn to Guermantes, making use of this intimacy to have him to dinner occasionally with Royalties who were curious to meet him. For the Duchess liked to entertain certain eminent men, on condition always that they were bachelors, a condition which, even when married, they invariably fulfilled for her, for, as their wives, who were bound to be more or less common, would have been a blot on a drawing-room in which there were never any but the most fashionable beauties in Paris, it was always without them that their husbands were invited; and the Duke, to avoid hurting any possible susceptibility, used to explain to these involuntary widowers that the Duchess never had women in the house, could not endure feminine society, almost as though this had been under doctor�s orders, and as be might have said that she could not stay in a room in which there were smells, or eat salt food, or travel with her back to the engine, or wear stays. It was true that these eminent men used to see at the Guermantes� the Princesse de Parme, the Princesse de Sagan (whom Fran�oise, hearing her constantly mentioned, had taken to calling, in the belief that this feminine, ending was required by the laws of accidence, �the Sagante�), and plenty more, but their presence was accounted for by the explanation that they were relatives, or such very old friends that it was impossible to exclude them. Whether or not they were convinced by the explanations which the Due de Guermantes had given of the singular malady that made it impossible for the Duchess to associate with other women, the great men duly transmitted them to their wives. Some of these thought that this malady was only an excuse to cloak her jealousy, because the Duchess wished to reign alone over a court of worshippers. Others more simple still thought that perhaps the Duchess had some peculiar habit, a scandalous past it might be, that women did not care to go to her house and that she gave the name of a whim to what was stern necessity. The better among them, hearing their husbands expatiate on the Duchess�s marvellous brain, assumed that She must be so far superior to the rest of womankind that she found their Society boring since they could not talk intelligently about anything. And it was true that the Duchess was bored by other women, if their princely rank did not render them specially interesting. But the excluded wives were mistaken when they imagined that she chose to entertain men alone in order to be free to discuss with them literature, science and philosophy. For she never referred to these, at least with the great intellectuals. If, by virtue of a family tradition such as makes the daughters of great soldiers preserve, in the midst of their most frivolous distractions a respect for military matters, she, the granddaughter of women who had been on terms of friendship with Thiers, M�rim�e and Augier, felt that a place must always be kept in her drawing-room for men of intellect, she had on the other hand derived from the manner, at once condescending and intimate, in which those famous men had been received at Guermantes the foible of looking on men of talent as family friends whose talent does not dazzle one, to whom one does not speak of their work, and who would not be at all interested if one did. Moreover the type of mind illustrated by M�rim�e and Meilhac and Hal�vy, which was hers also, led her by reaction from the verbal sentimentality of an earlier generation to a style in conversation that rejects everything to do with fine language and the expression of lofty thoughts, so that she made it a sort of element of good breeding when she was with a poet or a musician to talk only of the food that they were eating or the game of cards to which they would afterwards sit down. This abstention had, on a third person not conversant with her ways, a disturbing effect which amounted to mystification. Mme. de Guermantes having asked him whether it would amuse him to come to luncheon to meet this or that famous poet, devoured by curiosity he would arrive at the appointed hour. The Duchess was talking to the poet about the weather. They sat down to luncheon. �Do you like this way of doing eggs?� she asked the poet. On hearing his approval, which she shared, for everything in her own house appeared to her exquisite, including a horrible cider which she imported from Guermantes: �Give Monsieur some more eggs,� she would tell the butler, while the anxious fellow-guest sat waiting for what must surely have been the object of the party, since they had arranged to meet, in spite of every sort of difficulty, before the Duchess, the poet and he himself left Paris. But the meal went on, one after another the courses were cleared away, not without having first provided Mme. de Guermantes with opportunities for clever witticisms or apt stories. Meanwhile the poet went on eating, and neither Duke nor Duchess shewed any sign of remembering that he was a poet. And presently the luncheon came to an end and the party broke up, without a word having been said about the poetry which, for all that, everyone admired but to which, by a reserve analogous to that of which Swann had given me a foretaste, no one might refer. This reserve was simply a matter of good form. But for the fellow-guest, if he thought at all about the matter, there was something strangely melancholy about it all, and these meals in the Guermantes household made him think of the hours which timid lovers often spend together in talking trivialities until it is time to part, without � whether from shyness, from audacity or from awkwardness � the great secret which they would have been happier had they confessed ever succeeding in passing from their hearts to their lips. It must, however, be added that this silence with regard to the serious matters which one was always waiting in vain to see approached, if it might pass as characteristic of the Duchess, was by no means constant with her. Mme. de Guermantes had spent her girlhood in a society somewhat different, equally aristocratic but less brilliant and above all less futile than that in which she now lived, and one of wide culture. It had left beneath her present frivolity a sort of bed-rock of greater solidity, invisibly nutritious, to which indeed the Duchess would repair in search (very rarely, though, for she detested pedantry) of some quotation from Victor Hugo or Lamartine which, extremely appropriate, uttered with a look of true feeling from her fine eyes, never failed to surprise and charm her audience. Sometimes, even, without any pretence of authority, pertinently and quite simply, she would give some dramatist and Academician a piece of sage advice, would make him modify a situation or alter an ending.  ���If, in the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, just as in the church at Combray, on the day of Mlle. Percepied�s wedding, I had difficulty in discovering, in the handsome, too human face of Mme. de Guermantes the unknown element of her name, I at least thought that, when she spoke, her conversation, profound, mysterious, would have a strangeness as of a mediaeval tapestry or a gothic window. But in order that I should not be disappointed by the words which I should hear uttered by a person who called herself Mme. de Guermantes, even if I had not been in love with her, it would not have sufficed that those words were fine, beautiful and profound, they would have had to reflect that amaranthine colour of the closing syllable of her name, that colour which I had on my first sight of her been disappointed not to find in her person and had driven to take refuge in her mind. Of course I had already heard Mme. de Villeparisis, Saint-Loup, people whose intelligence was in no way extraordinary, pronounce without any precaution this name Guermantes, simply as that of a person who was coming to see them or with whom they had promised to dine, without seeming to feel that there were latent in her name the glow of yellowing woods in autumn and a whole mysterious tract of country. But this must have been an affectation on their part, as when the classic poets give us no warning of the profound purpose which they had, all the same, in writing, an affectation which I myself also strove to imitate, saying in the most natural tone: �The Duchesse de Guermantes,� as though it were a name that was just like other names. And then everybody assured me that she was a highly intelligent woman, a clever talker, that she was one of a little group of most interesting people: words which became accomplices of my dream. For when they spoke of an intelligent group, of clever talk, it was not at all the sort of intelligence that I knew that I imagined, not even that of the greatest minds, it was not at all with men like Bergotte that I peopled this group. No, by intelligence I understood an ineffable faculty gilded by the sun, impregnated with a sylvan coolness. Indeed, had she made the most intelligent remarks (in the sense in which I understood the word when it was used of a philosopher or critic), Mme. de Guermantes would perhaps have disappointed even more keenly my expectation of so special a faculty than if, in the course of a trivial conversation, she had confined herself to discussing kitchen recipes or the furnishing of a country house, to mentioning the names of neighbours and relatives of her own, which would have given me a picture of her life.  ��� �I thought I should find Basin here, he was meaning to come and see you to-day,� said Mme. de Guermantes to her aunt.  ��� �I haven�t set eyes on your husband for some days,� replied Mme. de Villeparisis in a somewhat nettled tone. �In fact, I haven�t seen him.� well, I have seen him once, perhaps � since that charming joke he played on me of making my servants announce him as the Queen of Sweden.�  ���Mme. de Guermantes formed a smile by contracting the corners of her mouth as though she were biting her veil,  ��� �We met her at dinner last night at Blanche Leroi�s. You wouldn�t know her now, she�s positively enormous; I�m sure she must have something the matter with her.�  ��� �I was just telling these gentlemen that you said she looked like a frog,�  ���Mme. de Guermantes uttered a sort of raucous sound intended to signify that she acknowledged the compliment.  ��� �I don�t remember making such a charming comparison, but if she was one before, now she�s the frog that has succeeded in swelling to the size of the ox. Or rather, it isn�t quite that, because all her swelling is concentrated in front of her waist, she�s more like a frog in an interesting condition.�  ��� �Ah, that is quite clever,� said Mme. de Villeparisis, secretly proud that her guests should be witnessing this display of her niece�s wit.  ��� �It is purely arbitrary, though,� answered Mme. de Guermantes, ironically detaching this selected epithet, as Swann would have done, �for I must admit I never saw a frog in the family way. Anyhow, the frog in question, who, by the way, is not asking for a king, for I never saw her so skittish as she�s been since her husband died, is coming to dine with us one day next week. I promised I�d let you know in good time.�  ���Mme. de Villeparisis gave vent to a confused growl, from which emerged: �I know she was dining with the Mecklenburgs the night before last. Hannibal de Br�aut� was there. He came and told me about it, and was quite amusing, I must say.�  ��� �There was a man there who�s a great deal wittier than Babal,� said Mme. de Guermantes who, in view of her close friendship wih M. de Br��ut�-Consalvi, felt that she must advertise their intimacy by the use of this abbreviation. �I mean M. Bergotte.�  ���I had never imagined that Bergotte could be regarded as witty; in fact, I thought of him always as mingling with the intellectual section of humanity, that is to say infinitely remote from that mysterious realm of which I had caught a glimpse through the purple hangings of a theatre box, behind which, making the Duchess smile, M. de Br�aut� was holding with her, in the language of the gods, that unimaginable thing, a conversation between people of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. I was stupefied to see the balance upset, and Bergotte rise above M. de Br�aut�. But above all I was dismayed to think that I had avoided Bergotte on the evening of Ph�dre, that I had not gone up and spoken to him, when I heard Mme. de Guermantes say to Mme. de Villeparisis:  ��� �He is the only person I have any wish to know,� went on the Duchess, in whom one could always, as at the turn of a mental tide, see the flow of curiosity with regard to well-known intellectuals sweep over the ebb of her aristocratic snobbishness. �It would be such a pleasure.�  ���The presence of Bergotte by my side, which it would have been so easy for we to secure but which I had thought liable to give Mme. de Guermantes a bad impression of myself, would no doubt, on the contrary, have had the result that she would have signalled to me to join her in her box, and would have invited me to bring the eminent writer, one day, to luncheon.  ��� �I gather that he didn�t behave very well, he was presented to M. de Cobourg, and never uttered a word to him,� said Mme. de Guermantes, dwelling on this odd characteristic as she might have recounted that a Chinaman had blown his nose on a sheet of paper. �He never once said �Monseigneur� to him,� she added, with an air of amusement at this detail, as important to her mind as the refusal of a Protestant, during an audience with the Pope, to go on his knees before his Holiness.  ���Interested by these idiosyncrasies of Bergotte, she did not, however, appear to consider them reprehensible, and seemed rather to find a certain merit in them, though she would have been put to it to say of what sort. Despite this unusual mode of appreciating Bergotte�s originality, it was a fact which I was later oh not to regard as wholly negligible that Mme. de Guermantes, greatly to the surprise of many of her friends, did consider Bergotte more witty than M. de Br�aut�. Thus it is that such judgments, subversive, isolated, and yet after all just, are delivered in the world of fashion by those rare minds that are superior to the rest. And they sketch then the first rough outlines of the hierarchy of values as the next generation will establish it, instead of abiding eternally by the old standards.  ���The Comte d�Argencourt, Charg� d�Affaires at the Belgian Legation and a remote connexion of Mme. de Villeparisis, came limping in, followed presently by two young men, the Baron de Guermantes and H. H. the Due de Ch�tellerault, whom Mme. de Guermantes greeted with: �How d�ye do, young Ch�tellerault,� in a careless tone and without moving from her tuffet, for she was a great friend of the young Duke�s mother, which had given him a deep and lifelong respect for her. Tall, slender, with golden hair and sunny complexions, thoroughly of the Guermantes type, these two young men looked like a condensation of the light of the spring evening which was flooding the spacious room. Following a custom which was the fashion at that time they laid their silk hats on the floor, by their feet. The historian of the Fronde thought that they were embarrassed, like a peasant coming into the mayor�s office and not knowing what to do with his hat. Feeling that he ought in charity to come to the rescue of the awkwardness and timidity which he ascribed to them:  ��� �No, no,� he said, �don�t leave them on the floor, they�ll be trodden on.�  ���A glance from the Baron de Guermantes, tilting the plane of his pupils, shot suddenly from them a wave of pure and piercing azure which froze the well-meaning historian.  ��� �What is that person�s name?� I was asked by the Baron, who had just been introduced to me by Mme. de Villeparisis.  ��� �M. Pierre,� I whispered.  ��� �Pierre what?�  ��� �Pierre: it�s his name, he�s a historian, a most distinguished man.�  ��� �Really? You don�t say so.�  ��� �No, it�s a new fashion with these young men to put their hats on the floor,� Mme. de Villeparisis explained. �I�m like you, I can never get used to it. Still, it�s better than my nephew Robert, who always leaves his in the hall. I tell him when I see him come in that he looks just like a clock-maker, and I ask him if he�s come to wind the clocks.�  ��� �You were speaking just now, Madame la Marquise, of M. Mole�s hat; we shall soon be able, like Aristotle, to compile a chapter on hats,� said the historian of the Fronde, somewhat reassured by Mme. de Villeparisis�s intervention, but in so faint a voice that no one but myself overheard him.  ��� �She really is astonishing, the little Duchess,� said M. d�Argencourt, pointing to Mme. de Guermantes who was talking to G��. �Whenever there�s a famous man in the room you�re sure to find him sitting with her. Evidently that must be the lion of the party over there. It can�t always be M. de Borelli, of course, or M. Schlumberger or M. d�Avenel. But then it�s bound to be M. Pierre Loti or M. Edmond Rostand. Yesterday evening at the Doudeauvilles�, where by the way she was looking splendid in her emerald tiara and a pink dress with a long train, she had M. Deschanel on one side and the German Ambassador on the other: she was holding forth to them about China; the general public, at a respectful distance where they couldn�t hear what was being said, were wondering whether there wasn�t going to be war. Really, you�d have said she was a Queen, holding her circle.�  ���Everyone had gathered round Mme. de Villeparisis to watch her painting.  ��� �Those flowers are a truly celestial pink,� said Legrandin, �I should say sky-pink. For there is such a thing as sky-pink just as there is sky-blue. But,� he lowered his voice in the hope that he would not be heard by anyone but the Marquise, �I think I shall still give my vote to the silky, living flesh tint of your rendering of them. You leave Pisanello and Van Huysun a long way behind, with their laborious, dead herbals.�  ���An artist, however modest, is always willing to hear himself preferred to his rivals, and tries only to see that justice is done them.  ��� �What makes you think that is that they painted the flowers of their period, which we don�t have now, but they did it with great skill.�  ��� �Ah! The flowers of their period! That is a most ingenious theory,� exclaimed Legrandin.  ��� �I see you�re painting some fine cherry blossoms � or are they may-flowers?� began the historian of the Fronde, not without hesitation as to the flower, but with a note of confidence in his voice, for he was beginning to forget the incident of the hats.  ��� �No; they�re apple blossom,� said the Duchesse de Guermantes, addressing her aunt.  ��� �Ah! I see you�re a good countrywoman like me; you can tell one flower from another.�  ��� �Why yes, so they are! But I thought the season for apple blossom was over now,� said the historian, seeking wildly to cover his mistake.  ��� �Oh dear, no; far from it, it�s not out yet; the trees won�t be in blossom for another fortnight, not for three weeks perhaps,� said the librarian who, since he helped with the management of Mme. de Villeparisis�s estates, was better informed upon country matters.  ��� �At least three weeks,� put in the Duchess; �even round Paris, where they�re very far forward. Down in Normandy, don�t you know, at his father�s place,� she went on, pointing to the young Duc de Ch�tellerault, �where they have some splendid apple trees close to the seashore, like a Japanese screen, they�re never really pink until after the twentieth of May.�  ��� �I never see them,� said the young Duke, �because they give me hay fever. Such a bore.�  ��� �Hay fever? I never heard of that before,� said the historian.  ��� �It�s the fashionable complaint just now,� the librarian informed him.  ��� �That all depends, you won�t get it at all, probably, if it�s a good year for apples. You know Le Normand�s saying: �When it�s a good year for apples . . . �,� put in M. d�Argencourt who, not being really French, was always trying to give himself a Parisian air.  ��� �You�re quite right,� Mme. de Villeparisis told her niece, �these are from the South. It was a florist who sent them round and asked me to accept them as a present. You�re surprised, I dare say, Monsieur Valm�re,� she turned to the librarian, �that a florist should make me a present of apple blossom. Well, I may be an old woman, but I�m not quite on the shelf yet, I have still a few friends,� she went on with a smile that might have been taken as a sign of her simple nature but meant rather, I could not help feeling, that she thought it effective to pride herself on the friendship of a mere florist when she moved in such distinguished circles.  ���Bloch rose and went over to look at the flowers which Mme. de Villeparisis was painting.  ��� �Never mind, Marquise,� said the historian, sitting down again, �even though we should have another of those Revolutions which have stained so many pages of our history with blood � and, upon my soul, in these days one can never tell,� he added, with a circular and circumspect glance, as though to make sure that there was no �disaffected� person in the room, though he had not the least suspicion that there actually was, �with a talent like yours and your five languages you would be certain to get on all right.� The historian of the Fronde was feeling quite refreshed, for he had forgotten his insomnia. But he suddenly remembered that he had not slept for the last six nights, whereupon a crushing weariness, born of his mind, paralysed his limbs, made him bow his shoulders, and his melancholy face began to droop like an old man�s.  ���Bloch tried to express his admiration in an appropriate gesture, but only succeeded in knocking over with his elbow the glass containing the spray of apple blossom, and all the water was spilled on the carpet.  ��� �Really, you have the fingers of a fairy,� went on (to the Marquise) the historian who, having his back turned to me at that moment, had not noticed Bloch�s clumsiness.  ���But Bloch took this for a sneer at himself, and to cover his shame in insolence retorted: �It�s not of the slightest importance; I�m not wet.�  ���Mme. de Villeparisis rang the bell and a footman came to wipe the carpet and pick up the fragments of glass. She invited the two young men to her theatricals, and also Mme. de Guermantes, with the injunction:  ��� �Remember to tell Gis�le and Berthe� (the Duchesses d�Auberjon and de Portefin) �to be here a little before two to help me,� as she might have told the hired waiters to come early to arrange the tables.  ���She treated her princely relatives, as she treated M. de Norpois, without any of the little courtesies which she shewed to the historian, Cottard, Bloch and myself, and they seemed to have no interest for her beyond the possibility of serving them up as food for our social curiosity. This was because she knew that she need not put herself out to entertain people for whom she was not a more or less brilliant woman but the touchy old sister � who needed and received tactful handling � of their father or uncle. There would have been no object in her trying to shine before them, she could never have deceived them as to the strength and weakness of her position, for they knew (none so well) her whole history and respected the illustrious race from which she sprang. But, above all, they had ceased to be anything more for her than a dead stock which would not bear fruit again, they would not let her know their new friends, or share their pleasures. She could obtain from them only their occasional presence, or the possibility of speaking of them, at her five o�clock tea-parties as, later on, in her Memoirs, of which these parties were only a sort of rehearsal, a preliminary reading aloud of the manuscript before a selected audience. And the society which all these noble kinsmen and kinswomen served to interest, to dazzle, to enthral, the society of the Cottards, of the Blochs, of the dramatists who were in the public eye at the moment, of the historians of the Fronde and such matters; it was in this society that there existed for Mme. de Villeparisis � failing that section of the fashionable world which did not call upon her � the movement, the novelty, all the entertainment of life, it was from people like these that she was able to derive social benefits (which made it well worth her while to let them meet, now and then, though without ever coming to know her, the Duchesse de Guermantes), dinners with remarkable men whose work had interested her, a light opera or a pantomime staged complete by its author in her drawing-room, boxes for interesting shows. Bloch got up to go. He had said aloud that the incident of the broken flower-glass was of no importance, but what he said to himself was different, more different still what he thought: �If people can�t train their servants to put flowers where they won�t be knocked over and wet their guests and probably cut their hands, it�s much better not to go in for such luxuries,� he muttered angrily. He was one of those susceptible, highly strung persons who cannot bear to think of themselves as having made a blunder which, though they do not admit even to themselves that they have made it, is enough to spoil their whole day. In a black rage, he was just making up his mind never to go into society again. He had reached the point at which some distraction was imperative. Fortunately in another minute Mme. de Villeparisis was to press him to stay. Either because she was aware of the general feeling among her friends, and had noticed the tide of anti-semitism that was beginning to rise, or simply from carelessness, she had not introduced him to any of the people in the room. He, however, being little used to society, felt bound before leaving the room to take leave of them all, to shew his manners, but without any friendliness; he lowered his head several times, buried his bearded chin in his collar, scrutinised each of the party in turn through his glasses with a cold, dissatisfied glare. But Mme. de Villeparisis stopped him; she had still to discuss with him the little play which was to be performed in her house, and also she did not wish him to leave before he had had the pleasure of meeting M. de Norpois (whose failure to appear puzzled her), although as an inducement to Bloch this introduction was quite superfluous, he having already decided to persuade the two actresses whose names he had mentioned to her to come and sing for nothing in the Marquise�s drawing-room, to enhance their own reputations, at one of those parties to which all that was best and noblest in Europe thronged. He had even offered her, in addition, a tragic actress �with pure eyes, fair as Hera,� who would recite lyrical prose with a sense of plastic beauty. But On hearing this lady�s name Mme. de Villeparisis had declined, for it was that of Saint-Loup�s mistress.  ��� �I have better news,� she murmured in my ear. �I really believe he�s quite cooled off now, and that before very long they�ll be parted � in spite of an officer who has played an abominable part in the whole business,� she added. For Robert�s family were beginning to look with a deadly hatred on M. de Borodino, who had given him leave, at the hairdresser�s instance, to go to Bruges, and accused him of giving countenance to an infamous intrigue. �It�s really too bad of him,� said Mme. de Villeparisis with that virtuous accent common to all the Guermantes, even the most depraved. �Too, too bad,� she repeated, giving the word a trio of t�s. One felt that she had no doubt of the Prince�s being present at all their orgies. But, as kindness of heart was the old lady�s dominant quality, her expression of frowning severity towards the horrible captain, whose name she articulated with an ironical emphasis: �The Prince de Borodino!�� speaking as a woman for whom the Empire simply did not count, melted into a gentle smile at myself with a mechanical twitch of the eyelid indicating a vague understanding between us.  ��� �I have a great admiration for de Saint-Loup-en-Bray,� said Bloch, �dirty dog as he is, because he�s so extremely well-bred. I have a great admiration, not for him but for well-bred people, they�re so rare,� he went on, without thinking, since he was himself so extremely ill-bred, what offence his words were giving. �I will give you an example which I consider most striking of his perfect breeding. I met him once with a young gentleman just as he was about to spring into his wheeled chariot, after he himself had buckled their splendid harness on a pair of steeds, whose mangers were heaped with oats and barley, who had no need of the flashing whip to urge them on. He introduced us, but I did not catch the gentleman�s name; one never does catch people�s names when one�s introduced to them,� he explained with a laugh, this being one of his father�s witticisms. �De Saint-Loup-en-Bray was perfectly calm, made no fuss about the young gentleman, seemed absolutely at his ease. Well, I found out, by pure chance, a day or two later, that the young gentleman was the son of Sir Rufus Israels!�  ���The end of this story sounded less shocking than its preface, for it remained quite incomprehensible to everyone in the room. The fact was that Sir Rufus Israels, who seemed to Bloch and his father an almost royal personage before whom Saint-Loup ought to tremble, was in the eyes of the Guermantes world a foreign upstart, tolerated in society, on whose friendship nobody would ever have dreamed of priding himself, far from it.  ��� �I learned this,� Bloch informed us, �from the person who holds Sir Rufus�s power of attorney; he is a friend of my father, and quite an extraordinary man. Oh, an absolutely wonderful individual,� he assured us with that affirmative energy, that note of enthusiasm which one puts only into those convictions that did not originate with oneself.  ��� �Tell me,� Bloch went on, lowering his voice, to myself, �how much do you suppose Saint-Loup has? Not that it matters to me in the least, you quite understand, don�t you. I�m interested from the Balzacian point of view. You don�t happen to know what it�s in, French stocks, foreign stocks, or land or what?�  ���I could give him no information whatsoever. Suddenly raising his voice, Bloch asked if he might open the windows, and without waiting for an answer, went across the room to do so. Mme. de Villeparisis protested that he must not, that she had a cold. �Of course, if it�s bad for you!� Bloch was downcast. �But you can�t say it�s not hot in here.� And breaking into a laugh he put into the gaze with which he swept the room an appeal for support against Mme. de Villeparisis. He received none, from these well-bred people. His blazing eyes, having failed to seduce any of the guests from their allegiance, faded with resignation to their normal gravity of expression; he acknowledged his defeat with: �What�s the temperature? Seventy-two, at least, I should say. I�m not surprised. I�m simply dripping. And I have not, like the sage Antenor, son of the river Aipheus, the power to plunge myself in the paternal wave to stanch my sweat before laying my body in a bath of polished marble and anointing my limbs with fragrant oils.� And with that need which people feel to outline for the use of others medical theories the application of which would be beneficial to their own health: �Well, if you believe it�s good for you! I must say, I think you�re quite wrong. It�s exactly what gives you your cold.�  ���Bloch was overjoyed at the idea of meeting M. de Norpois. He would like, he told us, to get him to talk about the Dreyfus case. �There�s a mentality at work there which I don�t altogether understand, and it would be quite sensational to get an interview out of this eminent diplomat,� he said in a tone of sarcasm, so as not to appear to be rating himself below the Ambassador.  ���Mme. de Villeparisis was sorry that he had said this so loud, but minded less when she saw that the librarian, whose strong Nationalist views kept her, so to speak, on leash, was too far off to have overheard. She was more shocked to hear Bloch, led on by that demon of ill-breeding which made him permanently blind to the consequences of what he said, inquiring, with a laugh at the paternal pleasantry: �Haven�t I read a learned treatise by him in which he sets forth a string of irrefutable arguments to prove that the Japanese war was bound to end in a Russian victory and a Japanese defeat? He�s fairly paralytic now, isn�t he? I�m sure he�s the old boy I�ve seen taking aim at his chair before sliding across the room to it, as if he was on wheels.�  ��� �Oh, dear, no! Not in the least like that! Just wait a minute,� the Marquise went on, �I don�t know what he can be doing.�  ���She rang the bell and, when the servant had appeared, as she made no secret, and indeed liked to advertise the fact that her old friend spent the greater part of his time in her house: �Go and tell M. de Norpois to come in� she ordered him, �he is sorting some papers in my library; he said he would be twenty minutes, and I�ve been waiting now for an hour and three-quarters. He will tell you about the Dreyfus case, anything you want to know,� she said gruffly to Bloch. �He doesn�t approve much of the way things are going.�  ���For M. de Norpois was not on good terms with the Government of the day, and Mme. de Villeparisis, although he had never taken the liberty of bringing any actual Ministers to her house (she still preserved all the unapproachable dignity of a great lady, and remained outside and above the political relations which he was obliged to cultivate), was kept well informed by him of everything that went on. Then, too, the politicians of the day would never have dared to ask M. de Norpois to introduce them to Mme. de Villeparisis. But several of them had gone down to see him at her house in the country when they needed his advice or help at critical conjectures. One knew the address. One went to the house. One did not see its mistress. But at dinner that evening she would say:  ��� �I hear they�ve been down here bothering you. I trust things are going better.�  ��� �You are not in a hurry?� she now asked Bloch.  ��� �No, not at all. I wanted to go because I am not very well; in fact there is some talk of my taking a cure at Vichy for my biliary ducts,� he explained, articulating the last words with a fiendish irony.  ��� �Why, that�s where my nephew Ch�tellerault�s got to go, you must fix it up together. Is he still in the room? He�s a nice boy, you know,� said Mme. de Villeparisis, and may quite well have meant what she said, feeling that two people whom she knew had no reason not to be friends with each other.  ��� �Oh, I dare say he wouldn�t care about that � I don�t really know him � at least I barely know him. He is sitting over there,� stammered Bloch in ecstasy of confusion.  ���The butler could not have delivered his mistress�s message properly, for M. de Norpois, to make believe that he had just come in from the street, and had not yet seen his hostess, had picked up the first hat that he had found in the hall, and came forward to kiss Mme. de Villeparisis�s hand with great ceremony, asking after her health with all the interest that people shew after a long separation. He was not aware that the Marquise had already destroyed any semblance of reality in this charade, which she cut short by taking M. de Norpois and Bloch into an adjoining room. Bloch, who had observed all the courtesy that was being shewn to a person whom he had not yet discovered to be M. de Norpois, had said to me, trying to seem at his ease: �Who is that old idiot?� Perhaps, too, all this bowing and scraping by M. de Norpois had really shocked the better element in Bloch�s nature, the freer and more straightforward manners of a younger generation, and he was partly sincere in condemning it as absurd. However that might be, it ceased to appear absurd, and indeed delighted him the moment it was himself, Bloch, to whom the salutations were addressed.  ��� �Monsieur l�Ambassadeur,� said Mme. de Villeparisis, �I should like you to know this gentleman. Monsieur Bloch, Monsieur le Marquis de Norpois.� She made a point, despite her casual usage of M. de Norpois, of addressing him always as �Monsieur l�Ambassadeur,� as a social convention as well as from an exaggerated respect for his Ambassadorial rank, a respect which the Marquis had inculcated in her, and also with an instinctive application to him of the special manner, less familiar and more ceremonious, in relation to one particular man � which, in the house of a distinguished woman, in contrast to the liberties that she takes with her other guests, marks that man out instantly as her lover.  ���M. de Norpois drowned his azure gaze in his white beard, bent his tall body deep down as though he were bowing before all the famous and (to him) imposing connotations of the name Bloch, and murmured: �I am delighted . . . � whereat his young listener, moved, but feeling that the illustrious diplomat was going too far, hastened to correct him, saying: �Not at all! On the contrary, it is I who am delighted.� But this ceremony, which M. de Norpois, in his friendship for Mme. de Villeparisis, repeated for the benefit of every fresh person that his old friend introduced to him, did not seem to her adequate to the deserts of Bloch, to whom she said:  ��� �Just ask him anything you want to know; take him into the other room if it�s more convenient; he will be delighted to talk to you. I think you wished to speak to him about the Dreyfus case,� she went on, no more considering whether this would suit M. de Norpois than she would have thought of asking leave of the Duchesse de Montmorency�s portrait before having it lighted up for the historian, or of the tea before pouring it into a cup.  ��� �You must speak loud,� she warned Bloch, �he�s a little deaf, but he will tell you anything you want to know; he knew Bismarck very well, and Cavour. That is so, isn�t it;� she raised her voice, �you knew Bismarck well?�  ��� �Have you got anything on the stocks?� M. de Norpois asked me with a knowing air as he shook my hand warmly. I took the opportunity to relieve him politely of the hat which he had felt obliged to bring ceremonially into the room, for I saw that it was my own which he had inadvertently taken. �You shewed me a somewhat laboured little thing in which you went in for a good deal of hair-splitting. I gave you my opinion quite frankly; what you had written was literally not worth the trouble of putting it on paper. Are you thinking of letting us have anything else? You were greatly smitten with Bergotte, if I remember rightly.� �You�re not to say anything against Bergotte,� put in the Duchess. �I don�t dispute his talent as a painter; no one would, Duchess. He understands all about etching, if not brush-work on a large scale like M. Cherbuliez. But it seems to me that in these days we have a tendency to confuse the arts, and forget that the novelist�s business is rather to weave a plot and edify his readers than to fiddle away at producing a frontispiece or tailpiece in drypoint. I shall be seeing your father on Sunday at our good friend A. J.�s,� he went on, turning again to myself.  ���I had hoped for a moment, when I saw him talking to Mme. de Guermantes, that he would perhaps afford me, for getting myself asked to her house, the help he had refused me for getting to Mme. Swann�s. �Another of my great favourites,� I told him, �is Elstir. It seems the Duchesse de Guermantes has some wonderful examples of his work, particularly that admirable Bunch of Radishes which I remember at the Exhibition and should so much like to see again; what a masterpiece that is!� And indeed, if I had been a prominent person and had been asked to state what picture I liked best, I should have named this Bunch of Radishes. �A masterpiece?� cried M. de Norpois with a surprised and reproachful air. �It makes no pretence of being even a picture, it is merely a sketch.� (He was right.) �If you label a clever little thing of that sort �masterpiece,� what have you got to say about H�bert�s Virgin or Dagnan-Bouveret?�  ��� �I heard you refusing to let him bring Robert�s woman,� said Mme. de Guermantes to her aunt, after Bloch had taken the Ambassador aside. �I don�t think you�ll miss much, she�s a perfect horror, as you know, without a vestige of talent, and besides she�s grotesquely ugly.�  ��� �Do you mean to say, you know her, Duchess?� asked M. d�Argencourt.  ��� �Yes, didn�t you know that she performed in my house before the whole of Paris, not that that�s anything for me to be proud of,� explained Mme. de Guermantes with a laugh, glad nevertheless, since the actress was under discussion, to let it be known that she herself had had the first fruits of her foolishness. �Hallo, I suppose I ought to be going now,� she added, without moving.  ���She had just seen her husband enter the room, and these words were an allusion to the absurdity of their appearing to be paying a call together, like a newly married couple, rather than to the often strained relations that existed between her and the enormous fellow she had married, who, despite his increasing years, still led the life of a gay bachelor. Ranging over the considerable party that was gathered round the tea-table the genial, cynical gaze � dazzled a little by the brightness of the setting sun � of the little round pupils lodged in the exact centre of his eyes, like the �bulls� which �the excellent marksman that he was could always hit with such perfect aim and precision, the Duke came forward with a bewildered cautious slowness as though, alarmed by so brilliant a gathering, he was afraid of treading on ladies� skirts and interrupting conversations. A permanent smile � suggesting a �Good King of Yvetot�� slightly pompous, a half-open hand floating like a shark�s fin by his side, which he allowed to be vaguely clasped by his old friends and by the strangers who were introduced to him, enabled him, without his having to make a single movement, or to interrupt his genial, lazy, royal progress, to reward the assiduity of them all by simply murmuring: �How do, my boy; how do, my dear friend; charmed, Monsieur Bloch; how do, Argencourt;� and, on coming to myself, who was the most highly favoured, when he had been told my name: �How do, my young neighbour, how�s your father? What a splendid fellow he is!� He made no great demonstration except to Mme. de Villeparisis, who gave him good-day with a nod of her head, drawing one hand from a pocket of her little apron.  ���Being formidably rich in a world where everyone was steadily growing poorer, and having secured the permanent attachment to his person of the idea of this enormous fortune, he displayed all the vanity of the great nobleman reinforced by that of the man of means, the refinement and breeding of the former just managing to control the latter�s self-sufficiency. One could understand, moreover, that his success with women, which made his wife so unhappy, was not due merely to his name and fortune, for he was still extremely good looking, and his profile retained the purity, the firmness of outline of a Greek god�s.  ��� �Do you mean to tell me she performed in your house?� M. d�Argencourt asked the Duchess.  ��� �Well, don�t you see, she came to recite, with a bunch of lilies in her hand, and more lilies on her dress.� Mme. de Guermantes shared her aunt�s affectation of pronouncing certain words in an exceedingly rustic fashion, but never rolled her r�s like Mme. de Villeparisis.  ���Before M. de Norpois, under constraint from his hostess, had taken Bloch into the little recess where they could talk more freely, I went up to the old diplomat for a moment and put in a word about my father�s Academic chair. He tried first of all to postpone the conversation to another day. I pointed out that I was going to Balbec. �What? Going again to Balbec? Why, you�re a regular globe-trotter.� He listened to what I had to say. At the name of Leroy-Beaulieu, he looked at me suspiciously. I conjectured that he had perhaps said something disparaging to M. Leroy-Beaulieu about my father and was afraid of the economist�s having repeated it to him. All at once he seemed animated by a positive affection for my father. And after one of those opening hesitations out of which suddenly a word explodes as though in spite of the speaker, whose irresistible conviction prevails over his half-hearted efforts at silence: �No, no,� he said to me with emotion, �your father must not stand. In his own interest he must not; it is not fair to himself; he owes a certain respect to his own really great merits, which would be compromised by such an adventure. He is too big a man for that. If he should be elected, he will have everything to lose and nothing to gain. He is not an orator, thank heaven. And that is the one thing that counts with my dear colleagues, even if you only talk platitudes. Your father has an important goal in life; he should march straight ahead towards it, and not allow himself to turn aside to beat bushes, even the bushes (more thorny for that matter than flowery) of the grove of Academe. Besides, he would not get many votes. The Academy likes to keep a postulant waiting for some time before taking him to its bosom. For the present, there is nothing to be done. Later on, I don�t say. But he must wait until the Society itself comes in quest of him. It makes a practice; not a very fortunate practice, a fetish rather, of the far� da s� of our friends across the Alps. Leroy-Beaulieu spoke to me about all this in a way I did not at all like. I pointed out to him, a little sharply perhaps, that a man accustomed as he is to dealing with colonial imports and metals could not be expected to understand the part played by the imponderables, as Bismarck used to say. But, whatever happens, your father must on no account put himself forward as a candidate, Principis obsta. His friends would find themselves placed in a delicate position if he suddenly called upon them for their votes. Indeed,� he broke forth, with an air of candour, fixing his blue eyes on my face, �I am going to say a thing that you will be surprised to hear coming from me, who am so fond of your father. Well, simply because I am fond of him (we are known as the inseparables �Arcades ambo), simply because I know the immense service that he can still render to his country, the reefs from which he can steer her if he remains at the helm; out of affection, out of high regard for him, out of patriotism, I should not vote for him. I fancy, moreover, that I have given him to understand that I should not.� (I seemed to discern in his eyes the stern Assyrian profile of Leroy-Beaulieu.) �So that to give him my vote now would be a sort of recantation on my part.� M. de Norpois repeatedly dismissed his brpther Academicians as old fossils. Other reasons apart, every member of a club or academy likes to ascribe to his fellow members the type of character that is the direct converse of his own, less for the advantage of being able to say: �Ah! If it only rested with me!� than for the satisfaction of making the election which he himself has managed to secure seem more difficult, a greater distinction. �I may tell you,� he concluded, �that in the best interests of you all, I should prefer to see your father triumphantly elected in ten or fifteen years� time.� Words which I assumed to have been dictated if not by jealousy, at any rate by an utter lack of any willingness to oblige, and which later on I was to recall when the course of events had given them a different meaning.  ��� �You haven�t thought of giving the Institute an address on the price of bread during the Fronde, I suppose,� the historian of that movement timidly inquired of M. de Norpois. �You could make a considerable success of a subject like that,� (which was to say, �you would give me a colossal advertisement,�) he added, smiling at the Ambassador pusillanimously, but with a warmth of feeling which made him raise his eyelids and expose a double horizon of eye. I seemed to have seen this look before, and yet I had met the historian for the first time this afternoon. Suddenly I remembered having seen the same expression in the eyes of a Brazilian doctor who claimed to be able to cure choking fits of the kind from which I suffered by some absurd inhalation of the essential oils of plants. When, in the hope that he would pay more attention to my case, I had told him that I knew Professor Cottard, he had replied, as though speaking in Cotterd�s interest: �Now this treatment of mine, if you were to tell him about it, would give him the material for a most sensational paper for the Academy of Medicine!� He had not ventured to press the matter but had stood gazing at me with the same air of interrogation, timid, anxious, appealing, which it had just puzzled me to see on the face of the historian of the Fronde. Obviously the two men were not acquainted and had little nothing in common, but psychological like physical laws have a more or less general application. And the requisite conditions are the same; an identical expression lights the eyes of different human animals, as a single sunrise lights different places, a long way apart, which have no connexion with one another. I did not hear the Ambassador�s reply, for the whole party, with a good deal of noise, had again gathered round Mme. de Villeparisis to watch her at work.  ��� �You know who� we�re talking about, Basin?� the Duchess asked her husband.  ��� �I can make a pretty good guess,� said the Duke.  ��� �Ah! As an actress she�s not, I�m afraid, in what one would call the great tradition.�  ��� �You can�t imagine,� went on Mme. de Guermantes to M. d�Argencourt �anything more ridiculous.�  ��� �In fact, it was drolatic,� put in M. de Guermantes, whose odd vocabulary enabled people in society to declare that he was no fool and literary people, at the same time, to regard him as a complete imbecile.  ��� �What I fail to understand,� resumed the Duchess, �is how in the world Robert ever came to fall in love with her. Oh, of course I know one mustn�t discuss that sort of thing,� she added, with the charming pout of a philosopher and sentimentalist whose last illusion had long been shattered. �I know that anybody may fall in love with anybody else. And,� she went on, for, though she might still laugh at modern literature, it, either by its dissemination through the popular press or else in the course of conversation, had begun to percolate into her mind, �that is the really nice thing about love, because it�s what makes it so �mysterious.��  ��� �Mysterious! Oh, I must confess, cousin, that�s a bit beyond me,� said the Comte d�Argencourt.  ��� �Oh dear, yes, it�s a very mysterious thing, love,� declared the Duchess, with the sweet smile of a good-natured woman of the world, but also with the rooted conviction with which a Wagnerian assures a bored gentleman from the Club that there is something more than just noise in the Walk�re. �After all, one never does know what makes one person fall in love with another; it may not be at all what we think,� she added with a smile, repudiating at once by this interpretation the idea she had just suggested. �After all, one never knows anything, does one?� she concluded with an air of weary scepticism. �Besides, one understands, doesn�t one; one simply can�t explain other people�s choices in love.�  ���But having laid down this principle she proceeded at once to abandon it and to criticise Saint-Loup�s choice.  ��� �All the same, don�t you know, it is amazing to me that a man can find any attraction in a person who�s simply silly.�  ���Bloch, hearing Saint-Loup�s name mentioned and gathering that he was in Paris, promptly made a remark about him so outrageous that everybody was shocked. He was beginning to nourish hatreds, and one felt that he would stop at nothing to gratify them. Once he had established the principle that he himself was of great moral worth and that the sort of people who frequented La Boulie (an athletic club which he supposed to be highly fashionable) deserved penal servitude, every blow he could get against them seemed to him praiseworthy. He went so far once as to speak of a lawsuit which he was anxious to bring against one of his La poulie friends. In the course of the trial he proposed to give certain evidence which would be entirely untrue, though the defendant would be unable to impugn his veracity. In this way Bloch (who, incidentally, never put his plan into action) counted on baffling and infuriating his antagonist. What harm could there be in that, since he whom he sought to injure was a man who thought only of doing the �right thing,� a La Boulie man, and against people like that any weapon was justified, especially in the hands of a Saint, such as Bloch himself?  ��� �I say, though, what about Swann?� objected M. d�Argencourt, who having at last succeeded in understanding the point of his cousin�s speech, was impressed by her accuracy of observation, and was racking his brains for instances of men who had fallen in love with women in whom he himself had seen no attraction.  ��� �Oh, but Swann�s case was quite different,� the Duchess protested. �It was a great surprise, I admit, because she�s just a well-meaning idiot, but she was never silly, and she was at one time good looking.�  ��� �Oh, oh!� muttered Mme. de Villeparisis.  ��� �You never thought so? Surely, she had some charming points, very fine eyes, good hair, she used to dress, and does still dress, wonderfully. Nowadays, I quite agree, she�s horrible, but she has been a lovely woman in her time. Not that that made me any less sorry when Charles married her, because it was so unnecessary.� The Duchess had not intended to say anything out of the common, but as M. d�Argencourt began to laugh she repeated these last words � either because she thought them amusing or because she thought it nice of him to laugh � and looked up at him with a coaxing smile, to add the enchantment of her femininity to that of her wit. She went on: �Yes, really, it wasn�t worth the trouble, was it; still, after all, she did have some charm and I can quite understand anybody�s falling in love with her, but if you saw Robert�s girl, I assure you, you�d simply die of laughter. Oh, I know somebody�s going to quote Augier at me: �What matters the bottle so long as one gets drunk?� Well, Robert may have got drunk, all right, but he certaintly hasn�t shewn much taste in his choice of a bottle! First of all, would you believe that she actually expected me to fit up a staircase right in the middle of my drawing-room. Oh, a mere nothing � what? � and she announced that she was going to lie flat on her stomach on the steps. And then, if you�d heard the things she recited, I only remember one scene, but I�m sure nobody could imagine anything like it; it was called the Seven Princesses.�  ��� �Seven Princesses! Dear, dear, what a snob she must be!� cried M. d�Argencourt. �But, wait a minute, why, I know the whole play. The author sent a copy to the King, who couldn�t understand a word of it and called on me to explain it to him.�  ��� �It isn�t by any chance, from the Sar Peladan?� asked the historian of the Fronde, meaning to make a subtle and topical allusion, but in so low a tone that his question passed unnoticed.  ��� �So you know the Seven Princesses, do you?� replied the Duchess, �I congratulate you! I only know one, but she�s quite enough; I have no wish to make the acquaintance of the other six. If they are all like the one I�ve seen!�  ��� �What a goose!� I thought to myself. Irritated by the coldness of her greeting, I found a sort of bitter satisfaction in this proof of her complete inability to understand Maeterlinck. �To think that�s the woman I walk miles every morning to see. Really, I�m too kind. Well, it�s my turn now not to want to see her.� Thus I reasoned with myself; but my words ran counter to my thoughts; they were purely conversational words such as we say to ourselves at those moments when, too much excited to remain quietly alone, we feel the need, for want of another listener, to talk to ourselves, without meaning what we say, as we talk to a stranger.  ��� �I can�t tell you what it was like,� the Duchess went on; �you simply couldn�t help laughing. Not that anyone tried; rather the other way, I�m sorry to say, for the young person was not at all pleased and Robert has never really forgiven me. Though I can�t say I�m sorry, actually, because if it had been a success the lady would perhaps have come again, and I don�t quite see Marie-Aynard approving of that.�  ���This was the name given in the family to Robert�s mother, Mme. de Marsantes, the widow of Aynard de Saint-Loup, to distinguish her from her cousin, the Princesse de Guermantes-Bavi�re, also a Marie, to whose Christian name her nephews and cousins and brothers-in-law added, to avoid confusion, either that of her husband or another of her own, making her Marie-Gilbert or Marie-Hedwige.  ��� �To begin with, there was a sort of rehearsal the night before, which was a wonderful affair!� went on Mme. de Guermantes in ironical pursuit of her theme. �Just imagine, she uttered a sentence, no, not so much, not a quarter of a sentence, and then she stopped; she didn�t open her mouth � I�m not exaggerating � for a good five minutes.�  ��� �Oh, I say,� cried M. d�Argencourt.  ��� �With the utmost politeness I took the liberty of hinting to her that this might seem a little unusual. And she said � I give you her actual words ��One ought always to repeat a thing as though one were just composing it oneself.� When you think of it, that really is monumental.�  ��� �But I understood she wasn�t at all bad at reciting poetry,� said one of the two young men.  ��� �She hasn�t the ghost of a notion what poetry is,� replied Mme. de Guermantes. �However, I didn�t need to listen to her to tell that. It was quite enough to see her come in with her lilies. I knew at once that she couldn�t have any talent when I saw those lilies!�  ���Everybody laughed.  ��� �I hope, my dear aunt, you aren�t angry with me, over my little joke the other day about the Queen of Sweden. I�ve come to ask your forgiveness.�  ��� �Oh, no, I�m not at all angry, I even give you leave to eat at my table, if you�re hungry. � Come along, M. Valm�re, you�re the daughter of the house,� Mme. de Villeparisis went on to the librarian, repeating a time-honoured pleasantry.  ���M de Guermantes sat upright in the armchair in which he had come to anchor his hat on the carpet by his side, and examined with a satisfied smile the plate of little cakes that was being held out to him.  ��� �This gentleman makes you an admirable daughter,� commented M. d�Argencourt, whom the spirit of imitation prompted to keep Mme. de Villeparisis�s little joke in circulation.  ���The librarian handed the plate of cakes to the historian of the Fronde.  ��� �You perform your functions admirably,� said the latter, startled into speech, and hoping also to win the sympathy of the crowd. At the same time he cast a covert glance of connivance at those who had anticipated him.  ��� �Tell me, my dear aunt,� M. de Guermantes inquired of Mme. de Villeparisis, �who was that rather good-looking man who was going out just now as I came in? I must know him, because he gave me a sweeping bow, but I couldn�t place him at all; you know I never can remember names, it�s such a nuisance,� he added, in a tone of satisfaction.  ��� �M. Legrandin.�  ��� �Oh, but Oriane has a cousin whose mother, if I�m not mistaken, was a Grandin. Yes, I remember quite well, she was a Grandin de l�Epervier.�  ��� �No,� replied Mme. de Villeparisis, �no relation at all. These are plain Grandins. Grandins of nothing at all. But they�d be only too glad to be Grandins of anything you chose to name. This one has a sister called Mme. de Cambremer.�  ��� �Why, Basin, you know quite well who� my aunt means,� cried the Duchess indignantly. �He�s the brother of that great graminivorous creature you had the weird idea of sending to call on me the other day. She stayed a solid hour; I thought I should go mad. But I began by thinking it was she who was mad when I saw a person I didn�t know come browsing into the room looking exactly like a cow.�  ��� �Listen, Oriane; she asked me what afternoon you were at home; I couldn�t very well be rude to her; and besides, you do exaggerate so, she�s not in the least like a cow,� he added in a plaintive tone, though not without a quick smiling glance at the audience.  ���He knew that his wife�s lively wit needed the stimulus of contradiction, the contradiction of common sense which protests that one cannot (for instance) mistake a woman seriously for a cow; by this process Mme. de Guermantes, enlarging upon her original idea, had been inspired to produce many of her most brilliant sayings. And the Duke in his innocent fashion helped her, without seeming to do so, to bring off her effects like, in a railway carriage, the unacknowledged partner of the three-card player.  ��� �I admit she doesn�t look like a cow, she looks like a dozen,� exclaimed Mme. de Guermantes. �I assure you, I didn�t know what to do when I saw a herd of cattle come marching into my drawing-room in a hat and heard them ask me how I was. I had half a mind to say: �Please, herd of cattle, you must be making a mistake, you can�t possibly know me, because you�re a herd of cattle,� but after racking my brains over her I came to the conclusion that your Cambremer woman must be the Infanta Dorothea who had said she was coming to see me one day, and is rather bovine also, so that I was just on the point of saying: �Your Royal Highness� and using the third person to a herd of cattle. The cut of her dewlap reminded me rather, too, of the Queen of Sweden. But this massed attack had been prepared for by long range artillery fire, according to all the rules of war. For I don�t know how long before, I was bombarded with her cards; I used to find them lying about all over the house, on all the tables and chairs like prospectuses. I couldn�t think what they were supposed to be advertising. You saw nothing in the house but �Marquis et Marquise de Cambremer� with some address or other which I�ve forgotten; you may be quite sure nothing will ever take me there.�  ��� �But it�s a great distinction to look like a Queen,� said the historian of the Fronde.  ��� �Gad, sir, Kings and Queens, in these days, don�t amount to much,� said M. de Guermantes, partly because he liked to be thought broad-minded and modern, and also so as not to seem to attach any importance to his own royal friendships, which he valued highly.  ���Bloch and M. de Norpois had returned from the other room and came towards us.  ��� �Well, sir,� asked Mme. de Villeparisis, �have you been talking to him about the Dreyfus case?�  ���M. de Norpois raised his eyes to the ceiling, but with a smile, as though calling on heaven to witness the monstrosity of the caprices to which his Dulcinea compelled him to submit. Nevertheless he spoke to Bloch with great affability of the terrible, perhaps fatal period through which France was passing. As this presumably meant that M. de Norpois (to whom Bloch had confessed his belief in the innocence of Dreyfus) was an ardent anti-Dreyfusard, the Ambassador�s geniality, his air of tacit admission that his listener was in the right, of never doubting that they were both of the same opinion, of being prepared to join forces with him to overthrow the Government, flattered Bloch�s vanity and aroused his curiosity. What were the important points which M. de Norpois never specified but on which he seemed implicitly to affirm that he was in agreement with Bloch; what opinion, then, did he hold of the case, that could bring them together? Bloch was all the more astonished at the mysterious unanimity which seemed to exist between him and M. de Norpois, in that it was not confined to politics, Mme. de Villeparisis having spoken at some length to M. de Norpois of Bloch�s literary work.  ��� �You are not of your age,� the former Ambassador told him, �and I congratulate you upon that. You are not of this age in which disinterested work no longer exists, in which writers offer the public nothing but obscenities or ineptitudes. Efforts such as yours ought to be encouraged, and would be, if we had a Government.�  ���Bloch was flattered by this picture of himself swimming alone amid a universal shipwreck. But here again he would have been glad of details, would have liked to know what were the ineptitudes to which M. de Norpois referred. Bloch had the feeling that he was working along the same lines as plenty of others; he had never supposed himself to be so exceptional. He returned to the Dreyfus case, but did not succeed in elucidating M. de Norpois�s own views. He tried to induce him to speak of the officers whose names were appearing constantly in the newspapers at that time; they aroused more curiosity than the politicians who were involved also, because they were not, like the politicians, well known already, but, wearing a special garb, emerging from the obscurity of a different kind of life and a religiously guarded silence, simply stood up and spoke and disappeared again, like Lohengrin landing from a skiff drawn by a swan. Bloch had been able, thanks to a Nationalist lawyer of his acquaintance, to secure admission to several hearings of the Zola trial. He would arrive there in the morning and stay until the court rose, with a packet of sandwiches and a flask of coffee, as though for the final examination for a degree, and this change of routine stimulating a nervous excitement which the coffee and the emotional interest of the trial worked up to a climax, he would come out so enamoured of everything that had happened in court that, in the evening, as he sat at home, he would long to immerse himself again in that beautiful dream and would hurry out, to a restaurant frequented by both parties, in search of friends with whom he would go over interminably the whole of the day�s proceedings, and make up, by a supper ordered in an imperious tone which gave him the illusion of power, for the hunger and exhaustion of a day begun so early and unbroken by any interval for luncheon. The human mind, hovering perpetually between the two planes of experience and imagination, seeks to fathom the ideal life of the people it knows and to know the people whose life it has had to imagine. To Bloch�s questions M. de Norpois replied:  ��� �There are two officers involved in the case now being tried of whom I remember hearing some time ago from a man in whose judgment I felt great confidence, and who praised them both highly � I mean M. de Miribel. They are Lieutenant-Colonel Henry and Lieutenant-Colonel Picquart.�  ��� �But,� exclaimed Bloch, �the divine Athena, daughter of Zeus, has put in the mind of one the opposite of what is in the mind of the other. And they are fighting against one another like two lions. Colonel Picquart had a splendid position in the Army, but his Moira has led him to the side that was not rightly his. The sword of the Nationalists will carve his tender flesh, and he will be cast out as food for the beasts of prey and the birds that wax fat upon the bodies of men.�  ���M. de Norpois made no reply.  ��� �What are those two palavering about over there?� M. de Guermantes asked Mme. de Villeparisis, indicating M. de Norpois and Bloch.  ��� �The Dreyfus case.�  ��� �The devil they are. By the way, do you know who is a red-hot supporter of Dreyfus? I give you a thousand guesses. My nephew Robert! I can tell you that, at the Jockey, when they heard of his goings on, there was a fine gathering of the clans, a regular hue and cry. And as he�s coming up for election next week . . . �  ��� �Of course,� broke in the Duchess, �if they�re all like Gilbert, who keeps on saying that all the Jews ought to be sent back to Jerusalem.�  ��� �Indeed; then the Prince de Guermantes is quite of my way of thinking,� put in M. d�Argencourt.  ���The Duke made a show of his wife, but did not love her. Extremely self-centred, he hated to be interrupted, besides he was in the habit, at home of treating her brutally. Convulsed with the twofold rage of a bad husband when his wife speaks to him, and a good talker wher he is not listened to, he stopped short and transfixed the Duchess with a glare which made everyone feel uncomfortable.  ��� �What makes you think we want to hear about Gilbert and Jerusalem? It�s nothing to do with that. But,� he went on in a gentler tone, �you will agree that if one of our family were to be pilled at the Jockey, especially Robert, whose father was chairman for ten years, it would be a pretty serious matter. What can you expect, my dear, it�s got �em on the raw, those fellows; they�re all over it. I don�t blame them, either; personally, you know that I have no racial prejudice, all that sort of thing seems to me out of date, and I do claim to move with the times; but damn it all, when one goes by the name of �Marquis de Saint-Loup� one isn�t a Dreyfusard; what more can I say?�  ���M. de Guermantes uttered the words: �When one goes by the name of Marquis de Saint-Loup,� with some emphasis. He knew very well that it was a far greater thing to go by that of Duc de Guermantes. But if his self-esteem had a tendency to exaggerate if anything the superiority of the title Duc de Guermantes over all others, it was perhaps not so much the rules of good taste as the laws of imagination that urged him thus to attenuate it. Each of us sees in the brightest colours what he sees at a distance, what he sees in other people. For the general laws which govern perspective in imagination apply just as much to dukes as to ordinary mortals. And not only the laws of imagination, but those of speech. Now, either of two laws of speech may apply here, one being that which makes us express ourselves like others of our mental category and not of our caste. Under this law M. de Guermantes might be, in his choice of expressions, even when he wished to talk about the nobility, indebted to the humblest little tradesman, who would have said: �When one goes by the name of Duc de Guermantes,� whereas an educated man, a Swann, a Legrandin would not have said it. A duke may write novels worthy of a grocer, even about life in high society, titles and pedigrees being of no help to him there, and the epithet �aristocratic� be earned by the writings of a plebeian. Who had been, in this instance, the inferior from whom M. de Guermantes had picked up �when one goes by the name,� he had probably not the least idea. But another law of speech is that, from time to time, as there appear and then vanish diseases of which nothing more is ever heard, there come into being, no one knows how, spontaneously perhaps or by an accident like that which introduced into France a certain weed from America, the seeds of which, caught in the wool of a travelling rug, fell on a railway embankment, forms of speech which one hears in the same decade on the lips of people who have not in any way combined together to use them. So, just as in a certain year I heard Bloch say, referring to himself, that �the most charming people, the most brilliant, the best known, the most exclusive had discovered that there was only one man in Paris whom they felt to be intelligent, pleasant, whom they could not do without � namely Bloch,� and heard the same phrase used by countless other young men who did not know him and varied it only by substituting their own names for his, so I was often to hear this �when one goes by the name.�  ��� �What can one expect,� the Duke went on, �with the influence he�s come under; it�s easy to understand.�  ��� �Still it is rather comic,� suggested the Duchess, �when you think of his mother�s attitude, how she bores us to tears with her Patrie Fran�aise, morning, noon and night.�  ��� �Yes, but there�s not only his mother to be thought of, you can�t humbug us like that. There�s a damsel, too, a fly-by-night of the worst type; she has far more influence over him than his mother, and she happens to be a compatriot of Master Dreyfus. She has passed on her state of mind to Robert.�  ��� �You may not have heard, Duke, that there is a new word to describe that sort of mind,� said the librarian, who was Secretary to the Anti-revisionist Committee. �They say �mentality.� It means exactly the same thing, but it has this advantage that nobody knows what you�re talking about. It is the very latest expression just now, the �last word� as people say.� Meanwhile, having heard Bloch�s name, he was watching him question M. de Norpois with misgivings which aroused others as strong though of a different order in the Marquise. Trembling before the librarian, and always acting the anti-Dreyfusard in his presence, she dreaded what he would say were he to find out that she had asked to her house a Jew more or less affiliated to the �Syndicate.�  ��� �Indeed,� said the Duke, ��mentality,� you say; I must make a note of that; I shall use it some day.� This was no figure of speech, the Duke having a little pocketbook filled with such �references� which he used to consult before dinner-parties. �I like �mentality.� There are a lot of new words like that which people suddenly start using, but they never last. I read somewhere the other day that some writer was �talentuous.� You may perhaps know what it means; I don�t. And since then I�ve never come across the word again.�  ��� �But �mentality� is more widely used than �talentuous,�� the historian of the Fronde made his way into the conversation. �I am on a Committee at the Ministry of Education at which I have heard it used several times, as well as at my Club, the Volney, and indeed at dinner at M. Emile Ollivier�s.�  ��� �I, who have not the honour to belong to the Ministry of Education,� replied the Duke with a feigned humility but with a vanity so intense that his lips could not refrain from curving in a smile, nor his eyes from casting round his audience a glance sparkling with joy, the ironical scorn in which made the poor historian blush, �I who have not the honour to belong to the Ministry of Education,� he repeated, relishing the sound of his words, �nor to the Volney Club (my only clubs are the Union and the Jockey � you aren�t in the Jockey, I think, sir?� he asked the historian, who, blushing a still deeper red, scenting an insult and failing to understand it, began to tremble in every limb), �I, who am not even invited to dine with M. Emile Ollivier, I must confess that I had never heard �mentality.� I�m sure you�re in the same boat, Argencourt.  ��� �You know,� he went on, �why they can�t produce the proofs of Dreyfus�s guilt. Apparently it�s because the War Minister�s wife was his mistress, that�s what people are saying.�  ��� �Ah! I thought it was the Prime Minister�s wife,� said M. d�Argencourt.  ��� �I think you�re all equally tiresome about this wretched case,� said the Duchesse de Guermantes, who, in the social sphere, was always anxious to shew that she did not allow herself to be led by anyone. �It can�t make any difference to me, so far as the Jews are concerned, for the simple reason that I don�t know any of them, and I intend to remain in that state of blissful ignorance. But on the other hand I do think it perfectly intolerable that just because they�re supposed to hold �sound� views and don�t deal with Jewish tradesmen, or have �Down with the Jews� printed on their sunshades, we should have a swarm of Durands and Dubois and so forth, women we should never have known but for this business, forced down our throats by Marie-Aynard or Victurnienne. I went to see Marie-Aynard a couple of days ago. It used to be so nice there. Nowadays one finds all the people one has spent one�s life trying to avoid, on the pretext that they�re against Dreyfus, and others of whom you have no idea who they can be.�  ��� �No; it was the War Minister�s wife; at least, that�s the bedside rumour,� went on the Duke, who liked to flavour his conversation with certain expressions which he imagined to be of the old school. �Personally, of course, as everyone knows, I take just the opposite view to my cousin Gilbert. I am not feudal like him. I would go about with a Negro if he was a friend of mine, and I shouldn�t care two straws what anybody thought; still after all you will agree with me that when one goes by the name of Saint-Loup one doesn�t amuse oneself by running clean against the rails of public opinion, which has more sense than Voltaire or even my nephew. Nor does one go in for what I may be allowed to call these acrobatics of conscience a week before one comes up for a club. It is a bit stiff, really! No, it is probably that little wench of his that has put him on his high horse. I expect she told him that he would be classed among the �intellectuals.� The intellectuals, they�re the very cream of those gentry. It�s given rise, by the way, to a rather amusing pun, though a very naughty one.�  ���And the Duke murmured, lowering his voice, for his wife�s and M. d�Argencourt�s benefit, �Mater Semita,� which had already made its way into the Jockey Club, for, of all the flying seeds in the world, that to which are attached the most solid wings, enabling it to be disseminated at the greatest distance from its parent branch, is still a joke.  ��� �We might ask this gentleman, who has a nerudite air, to explain it to us,� he went on, indicating the historian. �But it is better not to repeat it, especially as there�s not a vestige of truth in the suggestion. I am not so ambitious as my cousin Mirepoix, who claims that she can trace the descent of her family before Christ to the Tribe of Levi, and I will undertake to prove that there has never been a drop of Jewish blood in our family. Still there is no good in our shutting our eyes to the fact, you may be sure that my dear nephew�s highly original views are liable to make a considerable stir at Landerneau. Especially as Fezensac is ill just now, and Duras will be running the election; you know how he likes to make nuisances,� concluded the Duke, who had never succeeded in learning the exact meaning of certain phrases, and supposed �making nuisances� to mean �making difficulties.�  ���Bloch tried to pin M. de Norpois down on Colonel Picquart.  ��� �There can be no two opinions;� replied M. de Norpois, �his evidence had to be taken. I am well aware that, by maintaining this attitude, I have drawn screams of protest from more than one of my colleagues, but to my mind the Government were bound to let the Colonel speak. One can�t dance lightly out of a blind alley like that, or if one does there�s always the risk of falling into a ditch. As for the officer himself, his statement gave one, at the first hearing, a most excellent impression. When one saw him, looking so well in that smart Chasseur uniform, come into court and relate in a perfectly simple and frank tone what he had seen and what he had deduced, and say: �On my honour as a soldier�� (here M. de Norpois�s voice shook with a faint patriotic throb) ��such is my conviction,� it is impossible to deny that the impression he made was profound.�  ��� �There; he is a Dreyfusard, there�s not the least doubt of it,� thought Bloch.  ��� �But where he entirely forfeited all the sympathy that he had managed to attract was when he was confronted with the registrar, Gribelin. When one heard that old public servant, a man who had only one answer to make,� (here M. de Norpois began to accentuate his words with the energy of his sincere convictions) �when one listened to him, when one saw him look his superior officer in the face, not afraid to hold his head up to him, and say to him in a tone that admitted of no response: �Colonel, sir, you know very well that I have never told a lie, you know that at this moment, as always, I am speaking the truth,� the wind changed; M. Picquart might move heaven and earth at the subsequent hearings; he made a complete fiasco.�  ��� �No; evidently he�s an anti-Dreyfusard; it�s quite obvious,� said Bloch to himself. �But if he considers Picquart a traitor and a liar, how can he take his revelations seriously, and quote them as if he found them charming and believed them to be sincere. And if, on the other hand, he sees in him an honest man easing his conscience, how can he suppose him to have been lying when he was confronted with Gribelin?�  ��� �In any case, if this man Dreyfus is innocent,� the Duchess broke in, �he hasn�t done much to prove it. What idiotic, raving letters he writes from that island. I don�t know whether M. Esterhazy is any better, but he does shew some skill in his choice of words, a different tone altogether. That can�t be very pleasant for the supporters of M. Dreyfus. What a pity for them there�s no way of exchanging innocents.� Everybody laughed. �You heard what Oriane said?� the Duc de Guermantes inquired eagerly of e. de Villeparisis. �Yes; I think it most amusing.� This was not enough for the Duke. �Well, I don�t know, I can�t say that I thought it amusing; or rather it doesn�t make the slightest difference to me whether a thing is amusing or not. I don�t care about wit.� M. d�Argencourt protested. �It is probably because I�ve been a Member of Parliament, where I have listened to brilliant speeches that meant absolutely nothing. I learned there to value, more than anything, logic. That�s probably why they didn�t elect me again. Amusing things leave me cold.� �Basin, don�t play the heavy father like that, my child, you know quite well that no one admires wit more than you do.� �Please let me finish. It is just because I am unmoved by a certain type of humour, that I am often struck by my wife�s wit. For you will find it based, as a rule, upon sound observation. She reasons like a man; she states her case like a writer.�  ���Possibly the explanation of M. de Norpois�s speaking in this way to Bloch, as though they had been in agreement, may have lain in the fact that he himself was so keen an anti-Dreyfusard that, finding the Government not anti-Dreyfusard enough, he was its enemy just as much as the Dreyfusards. Perhaps because the object to which he devoted himself in politics was something more profound, situated on another plane, from which Dreyfusism appeared as an unimportant modality which did not deserve the attention of a patriot interested in large questions of foreign policy. Perhaps, rather, because the maxims of his political wisdom being applicable only to questions of form, of procedure, of expediency, they were as powerless to solve questions of fact as in philosophy pure logic is powerless to tackle the problems of existence; or else because that very wisdom made him see danger in handling such subjects and so, in his caution, he preferred to speak only of minor incidents. But where Bloch made a mistake was in thinking that M. de Norpois, even had he been less cautious by nature and of a less exclusively formal cast of mind, could (supposing he would) have told him the truth as to the part played by Henry, Picquart or du Paty de Clam, or as to any of the different aspects of the case. The truth, indeed, as to all these matters Bloch could not doubt that M. de Norpois knew. How could he fail to know it seeing that he was a friend of all the Ministers? Naturally, Bloch thought that the truth in politics could be approximately reconstructed by the most luminous minds, but he imagined, like the man in the street, that it resided permanently, beyond the reach of argument and in a material form, in the secret files of the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister, who imparted it to their Cabinet. Now, even when a political truth does take the form of written documents, it is seldom that these have any more value than a radiographic plate on which the layman imagines that the patient�s disease is inscribed in so many words, when, as a matter of fact, the plate furnishes simply one piece of material for study, to be combined with a number of others, which the doctor�s reasoning powers will take into consideration as a whole and upon them found his diagnosis. So, too, the truth in politics, when one goes to well-informed men and imagines that one is about to grasp it, eludes one. Indeed, later on (to confine ourselves to the Dreyfus case), when so startling an event occurred as Henry�s confession, followed by his suicide, this fact was at once interpreted in opposite ways by the Dreyfusard Ministers, and by Cavaignac and Cuignet who had themselves made the discovery of the forgery and conducted the examination; still more so among the Dreyfusard Ministers themselves, men of the same shade of Dreyfusism, judging not only from the same documents but in the same spirit, the part played by Henry was explained in two entirely different ways, one set seeing in him an accomplice of Esterhazy, the others assigning that part to du Paty de Clam, thus rallying in support of a theory of their opponent Cuignet and in complete opposition to their supporter Reinach. All that Bloch could elicit from M. de Norpois was that if it were true that the Chief of Staff, M. de Boisdeffre, had had a secret communication sent to M. Rochefort, it was evident that a singularly regrettable irregularity had occurred.  ��� �You may be quite sure that the War Minister must (in petto at any rate) be consigning his Chief of Staff to the infernal powers. An official disclaimer would not have been (to my mind) a work of supererogation. But the War Minister expresses himself very bluntly on the matter inter pocula. There are certain subjects, moreover, about which it is highly imprudent to create an agitation over which one cannot retain control afterwards.�  ��� �But those documents are obviously forged,� put in Bloch.  ���M. de Norpois made no reply to this, but announced that he did not approve of the manifestations that were being made by Prince Henri d�Orl�ans.  ��� �Besides, they can only ruffle the calm of the pretorium, and encourage agitations which, looked at from either point of view, would be deplorable. Certainly we must put a stop to the anti-militarist conspiracy, but we cannot possibly tolerate, either, a brawl encouraged by those elements on the Right who instead of serving the patriotic ideal themselves are hoping to make it serve them. Heaven be praised, France is not a South American Republic, and the need has not yet been felt here for a military pronunciamento.�  ���Bioch could not get him to speak on the question of Dreyfus�s guilt, nor would he utter any forecast as to the judgment in the civil trial then proceeding. On the other hand, M. de Norpois seemed only too ready to indicate the consequences of this judgment.  ��� �If it is a conviction,� he said, �it will probably be quashed, for it is seldom that, in a case where there has been such a number of witnesses, there is not some flaw in the procedure which counsel can raise on appeal. To return to Prince Henri�s outburst, I greatly doubt whether it has met with his father�s approval.�  ��� �You think Chartres is for Dreyfus?� asked the Duchess with a smile, her eyes rounded, her cheeks bright, her nose buried in her plate, her whole manner deliciously scandalised.  ��� �Not at all; I meant only that there runs through the whole family, on that side, a political sense which we have seen, in the admirable Princesse Cl�mentine, carried to its highest power, and which her son, Prince Ferdinand, has kept as a priceless inheritance. You would never have found the Prince of Bulgaria clasping Major Esterhazy to his bosom.�  ��� �He would have preferred a private soldier,� murmured Mme. de Guermantes, who often met the Bulgarian monarch at dinner at the Prince de Joinville�s, and had said to him once, when he asked if she was not envious: �Yes, Sir, of your bracelets.�  ��� �You aren�t going to Mme. de Sagan�s ball this evening?� M. de Norpois asked Mme. de Villeparisis, to cut short his conversation with Bloch. My friend had not failed to interest the Ambassador, who told us afterwards, not without a quaint simplicity, thinking no doubt of the traces that survived in Bloch�s speech of the neo-Homeric manner which he had on the whole outgrown: �He is rather amusing, with that way of speaking, a trifle old fashioned, a trifle solemn. You expect him to come out with �The Learned Sisters,� like Lamartine or Jean-Baptiste Rousseau. It has become quite uncommon in the youth of the present day, as it was indeed in the generation before them. We ourselves were inclined to be romantic.� But however exceptional his companion may have seemed to him, M. de Norpois decided that the conversation had lasted long enough.  ��� �No, sir, I don�t go to balls any more,� she replied with a charming grandmotherly smile. �You�re going, all of you, I suppose? You�re the right age for that sort of thing,� she added, embracing in a comprehensive glance M. de Ch�tellerault, his friend and Bloch. �Still, I was asked,� she went on, pretending, just for fun, to be flattered by the distinction. �In fact, they came specially to ask me.� (�They� being the Princesse de Sagan.)  ��� �I haven�t had a card,� said Bloch, thinking that Mme. de Villeparisis would at once offer to procure him one, and that Mme. de Sagan would be glad to see at her ball the friend of a woman whom she had called in person to invite.  ���The Marquise made no reply, and Bloch did not press the point, for he had another, more serious matter to discuss with her, and, with that in view, had already asked her whether he might call again in a couple of days. Having heard the two young men say that they had both just resigned from the Rue Royale Club, which was letting in every Tom, Dick and Harry, he wished to ask Mme. de Villeparisis to arrange for his election there.  ��� �Aren�t they rather bad form, rather stuck-up snobs, these Sagans?� he inquired in a tone of sarcasm.  ��� �Not at all, they�re the best we can do for you in that line,� M. d�Argencourt, who adopted all the catch-words of Parisian society, assured him.  ��� �Then,� said Bloch, still half in irony, �I suppose it�s one of the solemnities, the great social fixtures of the season.�  ���Mme. de Villeparisis turned merrily to Mme. de Guermantes.  ��� �Tell us, is it a great social solemnity, Mme. de Sagan�s ball?�  ��� �It�s no good asking me,� answered the Duchess, �I have never yet succeeded in finding out what a social solemnity is. Besides, society isn�t my strong point.�  ��� �Indeed; I thought it was just the other way,� said Bloch, who supposed Mme. de Guermantes to be speaking seriously.  ���He continued, to the desperation of M. de Norpois, to ply him with questions about the Dreyfus case. The Ambassador declared that, looking at it from outside, he got the impression from du Paty de Clam of a somewhat cloudy brain, which had perhaps not been very happily chosen to conduct that delicate operation, which required so much coolness and discernment, a judicial inquiry.  ��� �I know that the Socialist Party are crying aloud for his head on a charger, as well as for the immediate release of the prisoner from the Devil�s Isle. But I think that we are not yet reduced to the necessity of passing the Caudine Forks of MM. G�rault-Richard and Company. So far, the whole case has been an utter mystery, I don�t say that on one side just as much as on the other there has not been some pretty dirty work to be hushed up. That certain of your client�s more or less disinterested protectors may have the best intentions I will not attempt to deny, but you know that heaven is paved with such things,� he added, with a look of great subtlety. �It is essential that the Government should give the impression that they are not in the hands of the factions of the Left, and that they are not going to surrender themselves, bound hand and foot, at the demand of some pretorian guard or other, which, believe me, is not the same thing as the Army. It stands to reason that, should any fresh evidence come to light, a new trial would be ordered. And what follows from that? Obviously, that to demand a new trial is to force an open door. When the day comes, the Government will speak with no uncertain voice or will let fall into abeyance what is their essential prerogative. Cock and bull stories will no longer be enough. We must appoint judges to try Dreyfus. And that will be an easy matter because, although we have acquired the habit, in our sweet France, where we love to belittle ourselves, of thinking or letting it be thought that, in order to hear the words Truth and Justice, it is necessary to cross the Channel, which is very often only a roundabout way of reaching the Spree, there are judges to be found outside Berlin. But once the machinery of Government has been set in motion, will you have ears for the voice of authority? When it bids you perform your duty as a citizen will you have ears for its voice, will you take your stand in the ranks of law and order? When its patriotic appeal sounds, will you have the wisdom not to turn a deaf ear but to answer: �Present!�?�  ���M. de Norpois put these questions to Bloch with a vehemence which, while it alarmed my friend, flattered him also; for the Ambassador spoke to him with the air of one addressing a whole party, questioned him as though he had been in the confidence of that party and might be held responsible for the decisions which it would adopt. �Should you fail to disarm,� M. de Norpois went on, without waiting for Bloch�s collective answer, �should you, before even the ink had dried on the decree ordering the fresh trial of the case, obeying it matters not what insidious word of command, fail, I say, to disarm, and band yourselves, rather, in a sterile opposition which seems to some minds the ultima ratio of policy, should you retire to your tents and burn your boats, you would be doing so to your own, damnation. Are you the prisoners of those who foment disorder? Have you given them pledges?� Bloch was in doubt how to answer. M. de Norpois gave him no time. �If the negative be true, as I should like to think, and if you have a little of what seems to me to be lamentably lacking in certain of your leaders and your friends, namely political sense, then, on the day when the Criminal Court assembles, if you do not allow yourselves to be dragooned by the fishers in troubled waters, you will have won your battle. I do not guarantee that the whole of the General Staff is going to get away unscathed, but it will be so much to the good if some of them at least can save their faces without setting the heather on fire.  ��� �It stands to reason, moreover, that it is with the Government that it rests to pronounce judgment, and to close the list � already too long � of unpunished crimes, not certainly at the bidding of Socialist agitators, nor yet of any obscure military mouthpiece,� he added, looking Bloch boldly in the face, perhaps with the instinct that leads all Conservatives to establish support for themselves in the enemy�s camp. �Government action is not to be dictated by the highest bidder, from wherever the bid may come. The Government are not, thank heaven, under the orders of Colonel Driant, nor, at the other end of the scale, under M. Clemenceau�s. We must curb the professional agitators and prevent them from raising their heads again. France, the vast majority here in France, desires only to be allowed to work in orderly conditions. As to that, there can be no question whatever. But we must not be afraid to enlighten public opinion; and if a few sheep, of the kind our friend Rabelais knew so well, should dash headlong into the water, it would be as well to point out to them that the water in question was troubled, that it had been troubled deliberately by an agency not within our borders, in order to conceal the dangers lurking in its depths. And the Government ought not to give the impression that they are emerging from their passivity in self-defence when they exercise the right which is essentially their own, I mean that of setting the wheels of justice in motion. The Government will accept all your suggestions. If it is proved that there has been a judicial error, they can be sure of an overwhelming majority which would give them room to act with freedom.�  ��� �You, sir,� said Bloch, turning to M. d�Argencourt, to whom he had been made known, with the rest of the party, on that gentleman�s arrival, �you are a Dreyfusard, of course; they all are, abroad.�  ��� �It is a question that concerns only the French themselves, don�t you think?� replied M. d�Argencourt with that peculiar form of insolence which consists in ascribing to the other person an opinion which one must, obviously, know that he does not hold since he has just expressed one directly its opposite.  ���Bloch coloured; M. d�Argencourt smiled, looking round the room, and if this smile, so long as it was directed at the rest of the company, was charged with malice at Bloch�s expense, it became tempered with cordiality when finally it came to rest on the face of my friend, so as to deprive him of any excuse for annoyance at the words which he had heard uttered, though those words remained just as cruel. Mme. de Guermantes murmured something to M. d�Argencourt which I could not hear, but which must have referred to Bloch�s religion, for there flitted at that moment over the face of the Duchess that expression to which one�s fear of being noticed by the person of whom one is speaking gives a certain hesitancy and unreality, while there is blended with it the inquisitive, malicious amusement inspired in one by a group of human beings to which one feels oneself to be fundamentally alien. To retrieve himself, Bloch turned to the Duc de Ch�tellerault. �You, sir, as a Frenchman, you must be aware that people abroad are all Dreyfusards, although everyone pretends that in prance we never know what is going on abroad. Anyhow, I know � can talk freely to you; Saint-Loup told me so.� But the young Duke, who felt that every one was turning against Bloch, and was a coward as people often are in society, employing a mordant and precious form of wit which he seemed, by a sort of collateral atavism, to have inherited from M. de Charlus, replied: �You must not ask me, sir, to discuss the Dreyfus case with you; it is a subject which, on principle, I never mention except to Japhetics.� Everyone smiled, except Bloch, not that he was not himself in the habit of making scathing references to his Jewish origin, to that side of his ancestry which came from somewhere near Sinai. But instead of one of these epigrams (doubtless because he had not one ready) the operation of the internal machine brought to Bloch�s lips something quite different. And we caught only: �But how on earth did you know? Who told you?� as though he had been the son of a convict. Whereas, given his name, which had not exactly a Christian sound, and his face, his surprise argued a certain simplicity of mind.  ���What M. de Norpois had said not having completely satisfied him, he went up to the librarian and asked him whether Mme. de Villeparisis did not sometimes have in her house M. du Paty de Clam or M. Joseph Reinach. The librarian made no reply; he was a Nationalist, and never ceased preaching to the Marquise that the social revolution might break out at any moment, and that she ought to shew more caution in the choice of her friends. He asked himself whether Bloch might not be a secret emissary of the Syndicate, come to collect information, and went off at once to repeat to Mme. de Villeparisis the questions that Bloch had put to him. She decided that, at the best, he was ill-bred and might be in a position to compromise M. de Norpois. Also, she wished to give satisfaction to the librarian, the only person of whom she went in fear, by whom she was being indoctrinated, though without any marked success (every morning he read her M. Judet�s article in the Petit Journal). She decided, therefore, to make it plain to Bloch that he need not come to the house again, and had no difficulty in finding, among her social repertory, the scene by which a great lady shows anyone her door, a scene which does not in any way involve the raised finger and blazing eyes that people imagine. As Bloch came up to her to say good-bye, buried in her deep armchair, she seemed only half-awakened from a vague somnolence. Her sunken eyes gleamed with only the feeble though charming light of a pair of pearls. Bloch�s farewell, barely pencilling on the Marquise�s face a languid smile, drew from her not a word, nor did she offer him her hand. This scene left Bloch in utter bewilderment, but as he was surrounded by a circle of spectators he felt that it could not be prolonged without disadvantage to himself, and, to force the Marquise, the hand which she had made no effort to take he himself thrust out at her. Mme. de Villeparisis was startled. But doubtless, while still bent upon giving an immediate satisfaction to the librarian and the anti-Dreyfusard clan, she wished at the same time to provide for the future, and so contented herself with letting her eyelids droop over her closing eyes.  ��� �I believe she�s asleep,� said Bloch to the librarian who, feeling that he had the support of the Marquise, assumed an indignant air. �Good-bye madame,� snouted Bloch.  ���The old lady made the slight movement with her lips of a dying woman who wants to open her mouth but whose eye can no longer recognise people. Then she turned, overflowing with a restored vitality, to M. d�Argencourt, while Bloch left the room, convinced that she must be �soft� in the head. Full of curiosity and anxious to have more light thrown upon so strange an incident, he came to see lier again a few days later. She received him in the most friendly fashion, because she was a good-natured woman, because the librarian was not there, because she had in mind the little play which Bloch was going to produce for her, and finally because she had acted once and for all the little scene of the indignant lady that she had wished to act, a scene that had been universally admired and discussed the same evening in various drawing-rooms, but in a version which had already ceased to bear any resemblance to the truth.  ��� �You were speaking just now of the Seven Princesses, Duchess; you know (not that it�s anything to be proud of) that the author of that � what shall I call it? � that production is a compatriot of mine,� said M. d�Argencourt with a fine scorn blended with satisfaction at knowing more than anyone else in the room about the author of a work which had been under discussion. �Yes, he�s a Belgian, by nationality,� he went on.  ��� �Indeed! No, we don�t accuse you of any responsibility for the Seven Princesses. Fortunately for yourself and your compatriots you are not like the author of that absurdity. I know several charming Belgians, yourself, your King, who is inclined to be shy, but full of wit, my Ligne cousins, and heaps of others, but you, I am thankful to say, do not speak the same language as the author of the Seven Princesses. Besides, if you want to know, it�s not worth talking about, because really there is absolutely nothing in it. You know the sort of people who are always trying to seem obscure, and even plan to make themselves ridiculous to conceal the fact that they have not an idea in their heads. If there was anything behind it all, I may tell you that I�m not in the least afraid of a little daring,� she added in a serious tone, �provided that there is some idea in it. I don�t know if you�ve seen Borelli�s piece. Some people seem to have been shocked by it, but I must say, even if they stone me through the streets for saying it,� she went on, without stopping to think that she ran no very great risk of such a punishment, �I found it immensely interesting. But theSeven Princesses! It�s all very well, one of them having a fondness for my nephew, I cannot carry family feeling quite . . . �  ���The Duchess broke off abruptly, for a lady came in who was the Comtesse de Marsantes, Robert�s mother. Mme. de Marsantes was regarded in the Faubourg Saint-Germain as a superior being, of a goodness, a resignation that were positively angelic. So I had been told, and had had no particular reason to feel surprised, not knowing at the same time that she was the sister of the Duc de Guermantes. Later, I have always been taken aback, whenever I have learned that such women, melancholy, pure, victimised, venerated like the ideal forms of saints in church windows, had flowered from the same genealogical stem as brothers brutal, debauched and vile. Brothers and sisters, when they are closely alike in features as were the pue de Guermantes and Mme. de Marsantes, ought (I felt) to have a single intellect in common, the same heart, as a person would have who might vary between good and evil moods but in whom one could not, for all that, expect to find a vast breadth of outlook if he had a narrow mind, or a sublime abnegation if his heart was hard.  ���Mme. de Marsantes attended Bruneti�re�s lectures. She fascinated the Faubourg Saint-Germain and, by her saintly life, edified it as well. But the morphological link of handsome nose and piercing gaze led one, nevertheless, to classify Mme. de Marsantes in the same intellectual and moral family as her brother the Duke. I could not believe that the mere fact of her being a woman, and perhaps those of her having had an unhappy life and won everyone�s sympathy, could make a person be so different from the rest of her family, as in the old romances, where all the virtues and graces are combined in the sister of wild and lawless brothers. It seemed to me that nature, less unconventional than the old poets, must make use almost exclusively of the elements common to the family, and I was unable to credit her with enough power of invention to construct, out of materials analogous to those that composed a fool and clod, a lofty mind without the least strain of clownishness, a saint unsoiled by any brutality. Mme. de Marsantes was wearing a gown of white surah embroidered with large palms, on which stood out flowers of a different material, these being black. This was because, three weeks earlier, she had lost her cousin, M. de Montmorency, a bereavement which did not prevent her from paying calls or even from going to small dinners, but always in mourning. She was a great lady. Atavism had filled her with the frivolity of generations of life at court, with all the superficial, rigorous duties that that implies. Mme. de Marsantes had not had the strength of character to regret for any length of time the death of her father and mother, but she would not for anything in the world have appeared in colours in the month following that of a cousin. She was more than pleasant to me, both because I was Robert�s friend and because I did not move in the same world as he. This pleasantness was accompanied by a pretence of shyness, by that sort of intermittent withdrawal of the voice, the eyes, the mind which a woman draws back to her like a skirt that has indiscreetly spread, so as not to take up too much room, to remain stiff and erect even in her suppleness, as a good upbringing teaches. A good upbringing which must not, however, be taken too literally, many of these ladies passing very swiftly into a complete dissolution of morals without ever losing the almost childlike correctness of their manners. Mme. de Marsantes was a trifle irritating in conversation since, whenever she had occasion to speak of a plebeian, as for instance Bergotte or Elstir, she would say, isolating the word, giving it its full value, intoning it on two different notes with a modulation peculiar to the Guermantes: �I have had the honour, the great hon-our of meeting Monsieur Bergotte,� or �of making the acquaintance of Monsieur Elstir� whether that her hearers might marvel at her humility or from the sam tendency that Mme. de Guermantes shewed to revert to the use of obsolete forms, as a protest against the slovenly usages of the present day, in which people never professed themselves sufficiently �honoured.� Whichever Of these was the true reason, one felt that when Mme. de Marsantes said: �I have had the honour, the great hon-our,� she felt she was playing an important part and shewing that she could take in the names of distinguished men as she would have welcomed the men themselves at her home in the country, had they happened to be in the neighbourhood. On the other hand as her family connexion was numerous, as she was devoted to all her relatives, as, slow in speech and fond of explaining things at length, she was always trying to make clear the exact degree of kinship, she found herself (without any desire to create an effect and without really caring to talk about anyone except touching peasants and sublime gamekeepers) referring incessantly to all the mediatised houses in Europe, a failing which people less brilliantly connected than herself could not forgive, and, if they were at all intellectual, derided as a sign of stupidity.  ���In the country, Mme. de Marsantes was adored for the good that she did, but principally because the purity of a strain of blood into which for many generations there had flowed only what was greatest in the history of France had taken from her manner everything that the lower orders call �manners,� and had given her a perfect simplicity. She never shrank from kissing a poor woman who was in trouble, and would tell her to come up to the castle for a cartload of wood. She was, people said, the perfect Christian. She was determined to find an immensely rich wife for Robert. Being a great lady means playing the great lady, that is to say, to a certain extent, playing at simplicity. It is a pastime which costs an extremely high price, all the more because simplicity charms people only on condition that they know that you are not bound to live simply, that is to say that you are very rich. Some one said to me afterwards, when I had told him of my meeting her: �You saw of course that she must have been lovely as a young woman.� But true beauty is so individual, so novel always, that one does not recognise it as beauty. I said to myself this afternoon only that she had a tiny nose, very blue eyes, a long neck and a sad expression.  ��� �Listen,� said Mme. de Villeparisis to the Duchesse de Guermantes, �I�m expecting a woman at any moment whom you don�t wish to know. I thought I�d better warn you, to avoid any unpleasantness. But you needn�t be afraid, I shall never have her here again, only I was obliged to let her come to-day. It�s Swann�s wife.�  ���Mme. Swann, seeing the dimensions that the Dreyfus case had begun to assume, and fearing that her husband�s racial origin might be used against herself, had besought him never again to allude to the prisoner�s innocence. When he was not present she went farther and used to profess the most ardent Nationalism; in doing which she was only following the example of Mme. Verdurin, in whom a middle-class anti-semitism, latent hitherto, had awakened and grown to a positive fury. Mme. Swann had won by this attitude the privilege of membership in several of the women�s leagues that were beginning to be formed in anti-semitic society, and had succeeded in making friends with various members of the aristocracy. It may seem strange that, so far from following their example, the Duchesse de Guermantes, so close a friend of Swann, had on the contrary always resisted his desire, which he had not concealed from her, to introduce to her his wife. But we shall see in due course that this arose from the peculiar nature of the Duchess, who held that she was not �bound to� do things, and laid down with despotic force what had been decided by her social �free will,� which was extremely arbitrary.  ��� �Thank you for telling me,� said the Duchess. �It would indeed be most unpleasant. But as I know her by sight I shall be able to get away in time.�  ��� �I assure you, Oriane, she is really quite nice; an excellent woman,� said Mme. de Marsantes.  ��� �I have no doubt she is, but I feel no need to assure myself of it.�  ��� �Have you been invited to Lady Israels�s?� Mme. de Villeparisis asked the Duchess, to change the conversation.  ��� �Why, thank heaven, I don�t know the woman,� replied Mme. de Guermantes. �You must ask Marie-Aynard. She knows her. I never could make out why.�  ��� �I did indeed know her at one time,� said Mme. de Marsantes. �I confess my faults. But I have decided not to know her any more. It seems she�s one of the very worst of them, and makes no attempt to conceal it. Besides, we have all been too trusting, too hospitable. I shall never go near anyone of that race again. While we had old friends, country cousins, people of our own flesh and blood on whom we shut our doors, we threw them open to Jews. And now we see what thanks we get from them. But I�ve no right to speak; I have an adorable son, and, like a young fool, he says and does all the maddest things you can imagine,� she went on, having caught some allusion by M. d�Argencourt to Robert. �But, talking of Robert, haven�t you seen him?� she asked Mme. de Villeparisis; �being Saturday, I thought he�d be coming to Paris on leave, and in that case he would be sure to pay you a visit.�  ���As a matter of fact Mme. de Marsantes thought that her son would not obtain leave that week; but knowing that, even if he did, he would never dream of coming to see Mme. de Villeparisis, she hoped, by making herself appear to have expected to find him in the room, to procure his forgiveness from her susceptible aunt for all the visits that he had failed to pay her.  ��� �Robert here! But I have never had a single word from him; I don�t think I�ve seen him since Balbec.�  ��� �He is so busy; he has so much to do,� pleaded Mme. de Marsantes.  ���A faint smile made Mme. de Guermantes�s eyelashes quiver as she studied the circle which, with the point of her sunshade, she was tracing on the carpet. Whenever the Duke had been too openly unfaithful to his wife, Mme. de Marsantes had always taken up the cudgels against her own brother on her sister-in-law�s behalf. The latter had a grateful and bitter memory of this protection, and was not herself seriously shocked by Robert�s pranks. At this point the door opened again and Robert himself entered the room.  ��� �Well, talk of the Saint!� said Mme. de Guermantes.  ���Mme. de Marsantes, who had her back to the door, had not seen her son come in. When she did catch sight of him, her motherly bosom was convulsed with joy, as by the beating of a wing, her body half rose her seat, her face quivered and she fastened on Robert eyes big astonishment.  ��� �What! You�ve come! How delightful! What a surprise!�  ��� �Ah! Talk of the Saint! � I see,� cried the Belgian diplomat, with a shout of laughter.  ��� �Delicious, ain�t it?� came tartly from the Duchess, who hated puns and had ventured on this one only with a pretence of making fun of herself.  ��� �Good afternoon, Robert,� she said, �I believe he�s forgotten his aunt.�  ���They talked for a moment, probably about myself, for as Saint-Loup was leaving her to join his mother Mme. de Guermantes turned to me:  ��� �Good afternoon; how are you?� was her greeting.  ���She allowed to rain on me the light of her azure gaze, hesitated for a moment, unfolded and stretched towards me the stem of her arm, leaned forward her body which sprang rapidly backwards like a bush that has been pulled down to the ground and, on being released, returns to its natural position. Thus she acted under the fire of Saint-Loup�s eyes, which kept her under observation and were making frantic efforts to obtain some further concession still from his aunt. Fearing that our conversation might fail altogether, he joined in, to stimulate it, and answered for me:  ��� �He�s not very well just now, he gets rather tired; I think he would be a great deal better, by the way, if he saw you more often, for I can�t help telling you that he admires you immensely.�  ��� �Oh, but that�s very nice of him,� said Mme. de Guermantes in a deliberately casual tone, as if I had brought her her cloak. �I am most flattered.�  ��� �Look, I must go and talk to my mother for a minute; take my chair,� said Saint-Loup, thus forcing me to sit down next to his aunt.  ���We were both silent.  ��� �I see you sometimes in the morning,� she said, as though she were telling me something that I did not know, and I for my part had never seen her. �It�s so good for one, a walk.�  ��� �Oriane,� began Mme. de Marsantes in a low tone, �you said you were going on to Mme. de Saint-Ferr�ol�s; would you be so very kind as to tell her not to expect me to dinner, I shall stay at home now that I�ve got Robert. And one other thing, but I hardly like to ask you, if you would leave word as you pass to tell them to send out at once for a box of the cigars Robert likes. �Corona,� they�re called. I�ve none in the house.�  ���Robert came up to us; he had caught only the name of Mme. de Saint-Ferr�ol.  ��� �Who in the world is Mme. de Saint-Ferr�ol?� he inquired, in a sur � prised but decisive tone, for he affected a studied ignorance of everything to do with society.  ��� �But, my dear boy, you know quite well,� said his mother. �She�s Vermandois�s sister. It was she gave you that nice billiard table you liked so much.�  ��� �What, she�s Vermandois�s sister, I had no idea of that. Really, my family are amazing,� he went on, turning so as to include me in the conversation and adopting unconsciously Bloch�s intonation just as he borrowed his ideas, �they know the most unheard-of people, people called Saint-Ferr�ol� (emphasising the final consonant of each word) �and names like that; they go to balls, they drive in victorias, they lead a fabulous existence. It�s prodigious.�  ���Mme. de Guermantes made in her throat a slight, short, sharp sound, as of an involuntary laugh which one chokes back, meaning thereby to shew that she paid just as much tribute as the laws of kinship imposed on her to her nephew�s wit. A servant came in to say that the Prince von Faffenheim-Munsterburg-Weinigen had sent word to M. de Norpois that he was waiting.  ��� �Bring him in, sir,� said Mme. de Villeparisis to the old Ambassador, who started in quest of the German Minister.  ��� �Stop, sir; do you think I ought to shew him the miniature of the Empress Charlotte?�  ��� �Why, I�m sure he�ll be delighted,� said the Ambassador in a tone of conviction, and as though he were envying the fortunate Minister the favour that was in store for him.  ��� �Oh, I know he�s very sound,� said Mme. de Marsantes, �and that is so rare among foreigners. But I�ve found out all about him. He is anti-semitism personified.�  ���The Prince�s name preserved in the boldness with which its opening syllables were � to borrow an expression from music � attacked, and in the stammering repetition that scanned them, the impulse, the mannered simplicity, the heavy delicacies of the Teutonic race, projected like green boughs over the �heim� of dark blue enamel which glowed with the mystic light of a Rhenish window behind the pale and finely wrought gildings of the German eighteenth century. This name included, among the several names of which it was composed, that of a little German watering-place to which as a child I had gone with my grandmother, at the foot of a mountain honoured by the feet of Goethe, from the vineyards of which we used to drink, at the Kurhof, their illustrious vintages with elaborate and sonorous names, like the epithets which Homer applies to his heroes. And so, scarcely had I heard the Prince�s name spoken than, before I had recalled the watering-place, the name itself seemed to shrink, to grow rich with humanity, to find large enough a little place in my memory to which it clung, familiar, earth to earth, picturesque, savoury, light, with something about it, too, that was authorised, prescribed. And then, M. de Guermantes, in explaining who the Prince was, quoted a number of his titles, and I recognised the name of a village threaded by the river on which, every evening, my cure finished for the day, I used to go in a boat amid the mosquitoes, and that of a forest so far away that the doctor would not allow me to make the excursion to it. And indeed it was comprehensible that the suzerainty of the lord extended to the surrounding places and associated afresh in the enumeration of his titles the names which one could read, close together, upon a map. Thus beneath the visor of the Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and Knight of Franconia it was the face of a dear and smiling land, on which had often lingered for me the light of the six-o�clock sun, that I saw, at any rate before the Prince, Rheingraf and Elector Palatine had entered the room. For I speedily learned that the revenues which he drew from the forest and river, peopled with gnomes and undines, and from the enchanted mountain on which rose the ancient Burg that cherished memories of Luther and Lewis the Germanic, he employed in keeping five Charron motor-cars, a house in Paris and one in London, a box on Mondays at the Opera and another for the �Tuesdays� at the �Fran�ais.� He did not seem to me, nor did he seem to regard himself as different from other men of similar fortune and age who had a less poetic origin. He had their culture, their ideals, he was proud of his rank, but purely on account of the advantages it conferred on him, and had now only one ambition in life, to be elected a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, which was the reason of his coming to see Mme. de Villeparisis. If he, whose wife was a leader of the most exclusive set in Berlin, had begged to be introduced to the Marquise, it was not the result of any desire on his part for her acquaintance. Devoured for years past by this ambition to be elected to the Institute, he had unfortunately never been in a position to reckon above five the number of Academicians who seemed prepared to vote for him. He knew that M. de Norpois could by himself dispose of at least ten others, a number which he was capable, by skilful negotiations, of increasing still further. And so the Prince, who had known him in Russia when they were both there as Ambassadors, had gone to see him and had done everything in his power to win him over. But in vain might he multiply his friendly overtures, procure for the Marquis Russian decorations, quote him in articles on foreign politics; he had had before him an ingrate, a man in whose eyes all these attentions appeared to count as nothing, who had not advanced the prospects of his candidature one inch, had not even promised him his own vote. No doubt M. de Norpois received him with extreme politeness, indeed begged that he would not put himself out and �take the trouble to come so far out of his way,� went himself to the Prince�s residence, and when the Teutonic Knight had launched his: �I should like immensely to be your colleague,� replied in a tone of deep emotion: �Ah! I should be most happy!� And no doubt a simpleton, a Dr. Cottard would have said to himself: �Well, here he is in my house; it was he who insisted on coming, because he regards me as a more important person than himself; he tells me that he would be happy to see me in the Academy; words do have some meaning after all, damn it, probably if he doesn�t offer to vote for me it is because it hasn�t occurred to him. He lays so much stress on my great influence; presumably he imagines that larks drop into my mouth ready roasted, that I have all the support I want, and that is why he doesn�t offer me his; but I have only got to get him with his back to the wall, and just say to him quietly: �Very well, vote for me, will you?� and he will be obliged to do it.�  ���But Prince von Faffenheim was no simpleton. He was what Dr. Cottard would have called �a fine diplomat� and he knew that M. de Norpois was no less fine a one than himself, nor a man who would have failed to realise without needing to be told that he could confer a favour on a candidate by voting for him. The Prince, in his Embassies and as Foreign Minister, had conducted, on his country�s behalf instead of, as in the present instance, his own, many of those conversations in which one knows beforehand just bow far one is prepared to go and at what point one will decline to commit oneself. He was not unaware that, in this diplomatic language, to talk meant to offer. And it was for this reason that he had arranged for M. de Norpois to receive the Cordon of Saint Andrew. But if he had had to report to his Government the conversation which he had subsequently had with M. de Norpois, he would have stated in his dispatch: �I realised that I had gone the wrong way to work.� For as soon as he had returned to the subject of the Institute, M. de Norpois had repeated:  ��� �I should like nothing better; nothing could be better, for my colleagues. They ought, I consider, to feel genuinely honoured that you should have thought of them. It is a really interesting candidature, a little outside our ordinary course. As you know, the Academy is very conventional, it takes fright at everything which has at all a novel sound. Personally, I deplore this. How often have I had occasion to say as much to my colleagues! I cannot be sure, God forgive me, that I did not even once let the word �hidebound� escape me,� he added, in an undertone, with a scandalised smile, almost aside, as in a scene on the stage, casting at the Prince a rapid, sidelong glance from his blue eyes, like a veteran actor studying the effect on his audience. �You understand, Prince, that I should not care to allow a personality so eminent as yourself to embark on a venture which was hopeless from the start. So long as my colleagues� ideas linger so far behind the times, I consider that the wiser course will be to abstain. But you may rest assured that if I were ever to discern a mind that was a little more modern, a little more alive, shewing itself in that college, which is tending to become a mausoleum, if I could reckon upon any possible chance of your success, I should be the first to inform you of it.�  ��� �The Cordon was a mistake,� thought the Prince; �the negotiations have not advanced in the least; that is not what he wanted. I have not yet laid my hand on the right key.�  ���This was a kind of reasoning of which M. de Norpois, formed in the same school as the Prince, would also have been capable. One may mock at the Pedantic silliness with which diplomats of the Norpois type go into ecstasies over some piece of official wording which is, for all practical purposes, meaningless. But their childishness has this compensation; diplomats know that, in the loaded scales which assure that European or other equilibrium which we call peace, good feeling, sounding speeches, earnest entreaties weigh very little; and that the heavy weight, the true determinant consists in something else, in the possibility which the adversary does (if he is strong enough) or does not enjoy of satisfying, in exchange for what one oneself wants, a desire. With this order of truths, which an entirely disinterested person, such as my grandmother for instance, would not have understood M. de Norpois and Prince von Faffenheim had frequently had to deal. Charg� d�Affaires in countries with which we had been within an ace of going to war, M. de Norpois, in his anxiety as to the turn which events were about to take, knew very well that it was not by the word �Peace,� nor by the word �War� that it would be revealed to him, but by some other, apparently commonplace word, a word of terror or blessing, which the diplomat, by the aid of his cipher, would immediately read and to which, to safeguard the honour of France, he would respond in another word, quite as commonplace, but one beneath which the Minister of the enemy nation would at once see written: �War.� Moreover, in accordance with a time-honoured custom, analogous to that which gave to the first meeting between two young people promised to one another in marriage the form of a chance encounter at a performance in the Th��tre du Gymnase, the dialogue in the course of which destiny was to dictate the word �War� or the word �Peace� was held, as a rule, not in the ministerial sanctum but on a bench in a Kurgarten where the Minister and M. de Norpois went independently to a thermal spring to drink at its source their little tumblers of some curative water. By a sort of tacit convention they met at the hour appointed for their cure, began by taking together a short stroll which, beneath its innocent appearance, each of the speakers knew to be as tragic as an order for mobilisation. And so, in a private matter like this nomination for election to the Institute, the Prince had employed the same system of induction which had served him in his public career, the same method of reading beneath superimposed symbols.  ���And certainly it would be wrong to pretend that my grandmother and the few who resembled her would have been alone in their failure to understand this kind of calculation. For one thing, the average human being, practising a profession the lines of which have been laid down for him from the start, comes near, by his want of intuition, to the ignorance which my grandmother owed to her lofty disinterestedness. Often one has to come down to �kept� persons, male or female, before one finds the hidden spring of actions or words apparently of the most innocent nature in self-interest, in the bare necessity to keep alive. What man does not know that when a woman whom he is going to pay says to him: �Don�t let�s talk about money,� the speech must be regarded as what is called in music �a silent beat� and that if, later on, she declares: �You are far too much trouble; you are always keeping things from me; I�ve done with you,� he must interpret this as: �Some one else has been offering me more.� And yet this is only the language of a lady of easy virtue, not so far removed from the ladies in society. The apache furnishes more striking examples. But M. as Norpois and the German Prince, if apaches and their ways were unknown to them, had been accustomed to living on the same plane as nations, which are also, despite their greatness, creatures of selfishness and cunning, kept in order only by force, by consideration of their material interests which may drive them to murder, a murder that is often symbolic also, since its mere hesitation or refusal to fight may spell for a nation the word �Perish. But inasmuch as all this is not set forth in Yellow and otherwise coloured Books, the people as a whole are naturally pacific; should they be warlike, it is instinctively, from hatred, from a sense of injury, not for the reasons which have made up the mind of their ruler, on the advice of his Norpois.  ���The following winter the Prince was seriously ill; he recovered, but his heart was permanently affected.  ��� �The devil!� he said to himself, �I can�t afford to lose any time over the Institute. If I wait too long, I may be dead before they elect me. That really would be unpleasant.�  ���He composed, on the foreign politics of the last twenty years, an essay for the Revue des Deux Mondes, in which he referred more than once, and in the most flattering terms, to M. de Norpois. The French diplomat called upon him to thank him. He added that he did not know how to express his gratitude. The Prince said to himself, like a man who has been trying to fit various keys into a stubborn lock: �Still not the right one!� and, feeling somewhat out of breath as he shewed M. de Norpois to the door, thought: �Damn it, these fellows will see me in my grave before letting me in. We must hurry up.�  ���That evening, he met M. de Norpois again at the Opera.  ��� �My dear Ambassador,� he began to him, �you told me to-day that you did not know what you could do to prove your gratitude; it was a great exaggeration, for you owe me none, but I am going to be so indelicate as to take you at your word.�  ���M. de Norpois had no less high an esteem for the Prince�s tact than the Prince had for his. He understood at once that it was not a request that Prince von Faffenheim was about to present to him, but an offer, and with a radiant affability made ready to hear it.  ��� �Well now, you will think me highly indiscreet. There are two people to whom I am greatly attached � in quite different ways, as you will understand in a moment � two people both of whom have recently settled in Paris, where they intend to remain for the future: my wife, and the Grand Duchess John. They are thinking of giving a few dinners, chiefly in honour of the King and Queen of England, and what they would have liked more than anything in the world would have been to be able to offer their guests the company of a person for whom, without knowing her, they both of them feel a great admiration. I confess that I did not know how I was going to gratify their wish when I learned just now, by the most extraordinary accident, that you were a friend of this person. I know that she lives a most retired life, and sees only a very few people ��happy few,� as Stendhal would say � but if you were to give me your backing, with the generosity that you have always shewn me, I am sure that she would allow you to present me to her and to convey to her the wishes of both the Grand Duchess and the Princess. Perhaps she would consent to dine with us, when the Queen of England comes, and then (one never knows) if we don�t bore her too much, to spend the Easter holidays with us at Beaulieu, at the Grand Duchess John�s. The person I allude to is called the Marquise de Villeparisis. I confess that the hope of becoming one of the frequenters of such a school of wit would console me, would make me contemplate without regret the abandoning of my attempt at the Institute. For in her house, too, I understand, there is a regular flow of intellect and brilliant talk.�  ���With an inexpressible sense of pleasure the Prince felt that the lock no longer resisted, and that at last the key was turning.  ��� �Such an alternative is wholly unnecessary, my dear Prince,� replied M. de Norpois; �nothing is more in harmony with the Institute than the house you speak of, which is a regular hotbed of Academicians. I shall convey your request to Mme. la Marquise de Villeparisis: she will undoubtedly be flattered. As for her dining with you, she goes out very little and that will perhaps be more difficult to arrange. But I shall present you to her and you can plead your cause in person. You must on no account give up the Academy; to-morrow fortnight, as it happens, I shall be having luncheon, before going on with him to an important meeting, at Leroy-Beaulieu�s, without whom nobody can be elected; I had already allowed myself in conversation with him to let fall your name, with which, naturally, he was perfectly familiar. He raised certain objections. But it so happens that he requires the support of my group at the next election, and I fully intend to return to the charge; I shall tell him quite openly of the wholly cordial ties that unite us, I shall not conceal from him that, if you were to stand, I should ask all my friends to vote for you,� (here the Prince breathed a deep sigh of relief) �and he knows that I have friends. I consider that if I were to succeed in obtaining his assistance your chances would become very strong. Come that evening, at six, to Mme. de Villeparisis�s; I will introduce you to her and I can give you an account then of my conversation with him.�  ���Thus it was that Prince von Faffenheim had been led to call upon Mme. de Villeparisis. My profound disillusionment occurred when he spoke. It had never struck me that, if an epoch in history has features both particular and general which are stronger than those of a nationality, so that in a biographical dictionary with illustrations, which go so far as to include an authentic portrait of Minerva, Leibniz with his wig and ruff differs little from Marivaux or Samuel Bernard, a nationality has particular features stronger than those of a caste. In the present instance these were rendered before me not by a discourse in which I had expected, before I saw him, to hear the rustling of the elves and the dance of the kobolds, but by a transposition which certified no less plainly that poetic origin: the fact that, as he bowed, short, red, corpulent, over the hand of Mme. de Villeparisis, the Rheingraf said to her: �Aow to you too, Matame la Marquise,� in the accent of an Alsatian porter.  ��� �Won�t you let me give you a cup of tea or a little of this cake; it is so good?� Mme. de Guermantes asked me, anxious to have shewn herself as friendly as possible. �I do the honours in this house just as if it was mine,� she explained in an ironical tone which gave a slightly guttural sound to her voice, as though she were trying to stifle a hoarse laugh.  ��� �Sir,� said Mme. de Villeparisis to M. de Norpois, �you won�t forget that you have something to say to the Prince about the Academy?�  ���Mme. de Guermantes lowered her eyes and gave a semicircular turn to her wrist to look at the time.  ��� �Gracious! I must fly at once if I�m to get to Mme. de Saint-Ferr�ol�s, and I�m dining with Mme. Leroi.�  ���And she rose without bidding me good-bye. She had just caught sight of Mme. Swann, who appeared considerably embarrassed at finding me in the room. She remembered, doubtless, that she had been the first to assure me that she was convinced of Dreyfus�s innocence.  ��� �I don�t want my mother to introduce me to Mme. Swann,� Saint-Loup said to me. �She�s an ex-whore. Her husband�s a Jew, and she comes here to pose as a Nationalist. Hallo, here�s Uncle Palam�de.�  ���The arrival of Mme. Swann had a special interest for me, due to an incident which had occurred a few days earlier and which I am obliged to record on account of the consequences which it was to have at a much later date, as the reader will learn in due course. Well, a few days before this visit to Mme. de Villeparisis, I had myself received a visitor whom I little expected, namely Charles Morel, the son (though I had never heard of his existence) of my great-uncle�s old servant. This great-uncle (he in whose house I had met the lady in pink) had died the year before. His servant had more than once expressed his intention of coming to see me; I had no idea of the object of his visit, but should have been glad to see him for I had learned from Fran�oise that he had a genuine veneration for my uncle�s memory and made a pilgrimage regularly to the cemetery in which he was buried. But, being obliged, for reasons of health, to retire to his home in the country, where he expected to remain for some time, he delegated the duty to his son. I was surprised to see come into my room a handsome young fellow of eighteen, dressed with expensive rather than good taste, but looking, all the same, like anything in the world except the son of a gentleman�s servant. He made a point, moreover, at the start of our conversation, of severing all connexion with the domestic class from which he sprang, by informing me, with a smile of satisfaction, that he had won the first prize at the Conservatoire. The object of his visit to me was as follows: his father, when going through the effects of my uncle Adolphe, had set aside some which, he felt, could not very well be sent to my parents but were at the same time of a nature likely to interest a young man of my age. These were the photographs of the famous actresses, the notorious courtesans whom my uncle had known, the last fading pictures of that gay life of a man about town which he divided by a watertight compartment from his family life. While young Morel was shewing them to me, I noticed that he addressed me as though he were speaking to an equal. He derived from saying �you� to me as often, and �sir� as seldom, as possible the pleasure natural in one whose father had never ventured, when addressing my parents, upon anything but the third person. Almost all these photographs bore an inscription such as: �To my best friend.� One actress, less grateful and more circumspect than the rest, had written: �To the best of friends,� which enabled her (so I was assured) to say afterwards that my uncle was in no sense and had never been her best friend but was merely the friend who had done the most little services for her, the friend she made use of, a good, kind man, in other words an old fool. In vain might young Morel seek to divest himself of his lowly origin, one felt that the shade of my uncle Adolphe, venerable and gigantic in the eyes of the old servant, had never ceased to hover, almost a holy vision, over the childhood and boyhood of the son. While I was turning over the photographs Charles Morel examined my room. And as I was looking for some place in which I might keep them, �How is it,� he asked me (in a tone in which the reproach had no need to find expression, so im, plicit was it in the words themselves), �that I don�t see a single photograph of your uncle in your room?� I felt the blood rise to my cheeks and stammered: �Why, I don�t believe I have such a thing.� �What, you haven�t one photograph of your uncle Adolphe, who was so devoted to you! I� will send you one of my governor�s � he has quantities of them � and I hope you will set it up in the place of honour above that chest of drawers, which came to you from your uncle.� It is true that, as I had not even a photograph of my father or mother in my room, there was nothing so very shocking in there not being one of my uncle Adolphe. But it was easy enough to see that for old Morel, who had trained his son in the same way of thinking, my uncle was the important person in the family, my parents only reflecting a diminished light from his. I was in higher favour, because my uncle used constantly to say that I was going to turn out a sort of Racine, or Vaulabelle, and Morel regarded me almost as an adopted son, as a child by election of my uncle. I soon discovered that this young man was extremely �pushing.� Thus at this first meeting he asked me, being something of a composer as well and capable of setting short poems to music, whether I knew any poet who had a good position in society. I mentioned one. He did not know the work of this poet and had never heard his name, of which he made a note. Well, I found out that shortly afterwards he wrote to the poet telling him that, a fanatical admirer of his work, he, Morel, had composed a musical setting for one of his sonnets and would be grateful if the author would arrange for its performance at the Comtesse So-and-So�s. This was going a little too fast, and exposing his hand. The poet, taking offence, made no reply.  ���For the rest, Charles Morel seemed to have, besides his ambition, a strong leaning towards more concrete realities. He had noticed, as he came through the courtyard, Jupien�s niece at work upon a waistcoat, and although he explained to me only that he happened to want a fancy waistcoat at that very moment, I felt that the girl had made a vivid impression on him. He had no hesitation about asking me to come downstairs and introduce him to her, �but not as a connexion of your family, you follow me, I rely on your discretion not to drag in my father, say just a distinguished artist of your acquaintance, you know how important it is to make a good impression on tradespeople.� Albeit he had suggested to me that, not knowing him well enough to call him, he quite realised,�dear friend,� I might address him, before the girl, in some such terms as �not dear master, of course,.. although . . . well, if you like, dear distinguished artist,� once in the shop, I avoided �qualifying� him, as Saint-Simon would have expressed it, and contented myself with reiterating his �you.� He picked out from several patterns of velvet one of the brightest red imaginable and so loud that, for all his bad taste, he was never able to wear the waistcoat when it was made. The girl settled down to work again with her two �apprentices,� but it struck me that the impression had been mutual, and that Charles Morel, whom she regarded as of her own �station� (only smarter and richer), had proved singularly attractive to her. As I had been greatly surprised to find among the photographs which his father had sent me one of the portrait of Miss Sacripant (otherwise Odette) by Elstir, I said to Charles Morel as I went with him to the outer gate: �I don�t suppose you can tell me, but did my uncle know this lady well? I don�t see at what stage in his life I can fit her in exactly; and it interests me, because of M. Swann . . . � �Why, if I wasn�t forgetting to tell you that my father asked me specially to draw your attention to that lady�s picture. As a matter of fact, she was �lunching� with your uncle the last time you ever saw him. My father was in two minds whether to let you in. It seems you made a great impression on the wench, and she hoped to see more of you. But just at that time there was some trouble in the family, by what my father tells me, and you never set eyes on your uncle again.� He broke off with a smile of farewell, across the courtyard, at Jupien�s niece. She was watching him and admiring, no doubt, his thin face and regular features, his fair hair and sparkling eyes. I, as I gave him my hand, was thinking of Mme. Swann and saying to myself with amazement, so far apart, so different were they in my memory, that I should have henceforth to identify her with the �Lady in pink.�  ���M. de Charlus was not long in taking his place by the side of Mme. Swann. At every social gathering at which he appeared and, contemptuous towards the men, courted by the women, promptly attached himself to the smartest of the latter, whose garments he seemed almost to put on as an ornament to his own, the Baron�s frock coat or swallowtails made one think of a portrait by some great painter of a man dressed in black but having by his side, thrown over a chair, the brilliantly coloured cloak which he is about to wear at some costume ball. This partnership, generally with some royal lady, secured for M. de Charlus various privileges which he liked to enjoy. For instance, one result of it was that his hostesses, at theatricals or concerts, allowed the Baron alone to have a front seat, in a row of ladies, while the rest of the men were crowded together at the back of the room. And then besides, completely absorbed, it seemed, in repeating, at the top of his voice, amusing stories to the enraptured lady, M. de Charlus was dispensed from the necessity of going to shake hands with any of the others, was set free, in other words, from all social duties. Behind the scented barrier in which the beauty of his choice enclosed him, he was isolated amid a crowded drawing-room, as, in a crowded theatre or concert-hall, behind the rampart of a box; and when anyone came up to greet him, through, so to speak, the beauty of his companion, it was permissible for him to reply quite curtly and without interrupting his business of conversation with a lady. Certainly Mme. Swann was scarcely of the rank of the people with whom he liked thus to flaunt himself. But he professed admiration for her, friendship for Swann, he knew that she would be flattered by his attentions and was himself flattered at being compromised by the prettiest woman in the room.  ���Mme. de Villeparisis meanwhile was not too well pleased to receive a visit from M. de Charlus. He, while admitting serious defects in his aunt�s character, was genuinely fond of her. But every now and then, carried away by anger, by an imaginary grievance, he would sit down and write to her without making any attempt to resist his impulse, letters full of the most violent abuse, in which in made the most of trifling incidents which until then he seemed never even to have noticed. Among other examples I may instance the following, which my stay at Balbec brought to my knowledge-Mme. de Villeparisis, fearing that she had not brought enough money with her to Balbec to enable her to prolong her holiday there, and not caring since she was of a thrifty disposition and shrank from unnecessary expenditure, to have money sent to her from Paris, had borrowed three thousand francs from M. de Charlus. A month later, annoyed, for some trivial reason, with his aunt, he asked her to repay him this sum by telegraph. He received two thousand nine hundred and ninety-odd francs. Meeting his aunt a few days later in Paris, in the course of a friendly conversation, he drew her attention, with the utmost politeness, to the mistake that her banker had made when sending the money. �But there was no mistake,� replied Mme. de Villeparisis, �the money order cost six francs seventy-five.� �Oh, of course, if it was intentional, it is all right,� said M. de Charlus, �I mentioned it only in case you didn�t know, because in that case, if the bank had done the same thing with anyone who didn�t know you as well as I do, it might have led to unpleasantness.� �No, no, there was no mistake.� �After all, you were quite right,� M. de Charlus concluded easily, stooping to kiss his aunt�s hand. And in fact he bore no resentment and was only amused at this little instance of her thrift. But some time afterwards, imagining that, in a family matter, his aunt had been trying to get the better of him and had �worked up a regular conspiracy� against him, as she took shelter, foolishly enough, behind the lawyers with whom he suspected her of having plotted to undo him, he had written her a letter boiling over with insolence and rage. �I shall not be satisfied with having my revenge,� he added as a postscript; �I shall take care to make you a laughing-stock. Tomorrow I shall tell everyone the story of the money order and the six francs seventy-five you kept back from me out of the three thousand I lent you; I shall disgrace you publicly.� Instead of so doing, he had gone to his aunt the next day to beg her pardon, having already regretted a letter in which he had used some really terrible language. But apart from this, to whom could he have told the story of the money order? Seeking no longer vengeance but a sincere reconciliation, now was the time for him to keep silence. But already he had repeated the story everywhere, while still on the best of terms with his aunt; he had told it without any malice, as a joke, and because he was the soul of indiscretion. He had repeated the story, but without Mme. de Villeparisis�s knowledge. With the result that, having learned from his letter that he intended to disgrace her by making public a transaction in which he had told her with his own lips that she had acted rightly, she concluded that he had been deceiving her from the first, and had lied when he pretended to be fond of her. This storm had now died down, but neither of them knew what opinion exactly the other had of her or him. This sort of intermittent quarrel is of course somewhat exceptional. Of a different order were the quarrels of Bloch and his friends. Of a dif � ferent order again were those of M. de Charlus, as we shall presently see, with people wholly unlike Mme. de Villeparisis. In spite of which we must bear in mind that the opinions which we hold of one another, our relations with friends and kinsfolk, are in no sense permanent, save in appearance, but are as eternally fluid as the sea itself. Whence all the rumours of divorce between couples who have always seemed so perfectly united and will soon afterwards speak of one another with affection, hence all the terrible things said by one friend of another from whom we supposed him to be inseparable and with whom we shall find him once more reconciled before we have had time to recover from our surprise; all the ruptures of alliances, after so short a time, between nations.  ��� �I say, my uncle and Mme. Swann are getting warm over there!� remarked Saint-Loup. �And look at Mamma in the innocence of her heart going across to disturb them. To the pure all things are pure, I suppose!�  ���I studied M. de Charlus. The tuft of his grey hair, his eye, the brow of which was raised by his monocle to emit a smile, the red flowers in his buttonhole formed, so to speak, the three mobile apices of a convulsive and striking triangle. I had not ventured to bow to him, for he had given me no sign of recognition. And yet, albeit he had not turned his head in my direction, I was convinced that he had seen me; while he repeated some story to Mme. Swann, whose sumptuous, pansy-coloured cloak floated actually over the Baron�s knee, his roving eye, like that of a street hawker who is watching all the time for the �tecs� to appear, had certainly explored every corner of the room and taken note of all the people who were in it. M. de Ch�tellerault came up to bid him good day without any indication on M. de Charlus�s face that he had seen the young Duke until he was actually standing in front of him. In this way, in fairly numerous gatherings such as this, M. de Charlus kept almost continuously on show a smile without any definite direction or particular object, which, pre-existing before the greetings of new arrivals, found itself, when these entered its zone, devoid of any indication of friendliness towards them. Nevertheless, it was obviously my duty to go across and speak to Mme. Swann. But as she was not certain whether I already knew Mme. de Marsantes and M. de Charlus, she was distinctly cold, fearing no doubt that I might ask her to introduce me to them. I then made my way to M. de Charlus, and at once regretted it, for though he could not have helped seeing me he shewed no sign whatsoever. As I stood before him and bowed I found standing out from his body, which it prevented me from approaching by the full length of his outstretched arm, a finger widowed, one would have said, of an episcopal ring, of which he appeared to be offering, for the kiss of the faithful, the consecrated site, and I was made to appear to have penetrated, without leave from the Baron and by an act of trespass for which he would hold me permanently responsible, the anonymous and vacant dispersion of his smile. This coldness was hardly of a kind to encourage Mme. Swann to melt from hers.  ��� �How tired and worried you look,� said Mme. de Marsantes to her son who had come up to greet M. de Charlus.  ���And indeed the expression in Robert�s eyes seemed every minute to reach a depth from which it rose at once like a diver who has touched bottom This bottom which hurt Robert so when he touched it that he left it at once, to return to it a moment later, was the thought that he had quarrelled with his mistress.  ��� �Never mind,� his mother went on, stroking his cheek, �never mind; it�s good to see my little boy again.�  ���But this show of affection seeming to irritate Robert, Mme. de Marsantes led her son away to the other end of the room where in an alcove hung with yellow silk a group of Beauvais armchairs massed their violet-hued tapestries like purple irises in a field of buttercups. Mme. Swann, finding herself alone and having realised that I was a friend of Saint-Loup, beckoned to me to come and sit beside her. Not having seen her for so long I did not know what to talk to her about. I was keeping an eye on my hat, among the crowd of hats that littered the carpet, and I asked myself with a vague curiosity to whom one of them could belong which was not that of the Duc de Guermantes and yet in the lining of which a capital �G� was surmounted by a ducal coronet. I knew who everyone in the room was, and could not think of anyone whose hat this could possibly be.  ��� �What a pleasant man M. de Norpois is,� I said to Mme. Swann, looking at the Ambassador. �It is true, Robert de Saint-Loup says he�s a pest, but . . . �  ��� �He is quite right,� she replied.  ���Seeing from her face that she was thinking of something which she was keeping from me, I plied her with questions. For the satisfaction of appearing to be greatly taken up by some one in this room where she knew hardly anyone, she took me into a corner.  ��� �I am sure this is what M. de Saint-Loup meant,� she began, �but you must never tell him I said so, for he would think me indiscreet, and I value his esteem very highly; I am an �honest Injun,� don�t you know. The other day, Charlus was dining at the Princesse de Guermantes�s; I don�t know how it was, but your name was mentioned. M. de Norpois seems to have told them � it�s all too silly for words, don�t go and worry yourself to death over it, nobody paid any attention, they all knew only too well the mischievous tongue that said it � that you were a hypocritical little flatterer.�  ���I have recorded a long way back my stupefaction at the discovery that a friend of my father, such as M. de Norpois was, could have expressed himself thus in speaking of me. I was even more astonished to learn that my emotion on that evening long ago when I had asked him about Mme. Swann and Gilberte was known to the Princesse de Guermantes, whom I imagined never to have heard of my existence. Each of our actions, our words, our attitudes is cut off from the �world,� from the people who have not directly perceived it, by a medium the permeability of which is of infinite variation and remains unknown to ourselves; having learned by experience that some important utterance which we eagerly hoped would be disseminated (such as those so enthusiastic speeches which I used at one time to make to all comers and on every occasion on the subject of Mme. Swann) has found itself, often simply on account of our anxiety, immediately hidden under a bushel, how immeasurably less do we suppose that some tiny word, which we ourselves have forgotten, or else a word never ottered by us but formed on its course by the imperfect refraction of a different word, can be transported without ever halting for any obstacle to infinite distances � in the present instance to the Princesse de Guermantes � and succeed in diverting at our expense the banquet of the gods. What we actually recall of our conduct remains unknown to our nearest neighbour; what we have forgotten that we ever said, or indeed what we never did say, flies to provoke hilarity even in another planet, and the image that other people form of our actions and behaviour is no more like that which we form of them ourselves, than is like an original drawing a spoiled copy in which, at one point, for a black line, we find an empty gap, and for a blank space an unaccountable contour. It may be, all the same, that what has not been transcribed is some non-existent feature which we behold merely in our purblind self-esteem, and that what seems to us added is indeed a part of ourselves, but so essential a part as to have escaped our notice. So that this strange print which seems to us to have so little resemblance to ourselves bears sometimes the same stamp of truth, scarcely flattering, indeed, but profound and useful, as a photograph taken by X-rays. Not that that is any reason why we should recognise ourselves in it. A man who is in the habit of smiling in the glass at his handsome face and stalwart figure, if you shew him their radiograph, will have, face to face with that rosary of bones, labelled as being the image of himself, the same suspicion of error as the visitor to an art gallery who, on coming to the portrait of a girl, reads in his catalogue: �Dromedary resting.� Later on, this discrepancy between our portraits, according as it was our own hand that drew them or another, I was to register in the case of others than myself, living placidly in the midst of a collection of photographs which they themselves had taken while round about them grinned frightful faces, invisible to them as a rule, but plunging them in stupor if an accident were to reveal them with the warning: �This is you.�  ���A few years earlier I should have been only too glad to tell Mme. Swann in what connexion I had fawned upon M. de Norpois, since the connexion had been my desire to know her. But I no longer felt this desire, I was no longer in love with Gilberte. On the other hand I had not succeeded in identifying Mme. Swann with the lady in pink of my childhood. Accordingly I spoke of the woman who was on my mind at the moment.  ��� �Did you see the Duchesse de Guermantes just now?� I asked Mme. Swann.  ���But since the Duchess did not bow to Mme. Swann when they met, the latter chose to appear to regard her as a person of no importance, whose presence in a room one did not even remark.  ��� �I don�t know; I didn�t realise her,� she replied sourly, using an expression borrowed from England.  ���I was anxious nevertheless for information with regard not only to Mme. de Guermantes but to all the people who came in contact with her, and (for all the world like Bloch), with the tactlessness of people who seek in their conversation not to give pleasure to others but to elucidate, from sheer egoism, facts that are interesting to themselves, in my effort to form an exact idea of the life of Mme. de Guermantes I questioned Mme de Villeparisis about Mme. Leroi.  ��� �Oh, yes, I know who� you mean,� she replied with an affectation of contempt, �the daughter of those rich timber people. I�ve heard that she�s begun to go about quite a lot lately, but I must explain to you that I am rather old now to make new acquaintances. I have known such interesting such delightful people in my time that really I do not believe Mme. Lerol would be any addition to what I already have.� Mme. de Marsantes, who was playing lady in waiting to the Marquise, presented me to the Prince and, while she was still doing so, M. de Norpois also presented me in the most glowing terms. Perhaps he found it convenient to do me a courtesy which could in no way damage his credit since I had just been presented, perhaps it was because he thought that a foreigner, even so distinguished a foreigner, was unfamiliar with French society and might think that he was having introduced to him a young man of fashion, perhaps to exercise one of his prerogatives, that of adding the weight of his personal recommendation as an Ambassador, or in his taste for the archaic to revive in the Prince�s honour the old custom, flattering to his rank, that two sponsors were necessary if one wished to be presented.  ���Mme. de Villeparisis appealed to M. de Norpois, feeling it imperative that I should have his assurance that she had nothing to regret in not knowing Mme. Leroi.  ��� �Am I not right, M. l�Ambassadeur, Mme. Leroi is quite uninteresting, isn�t she, quite out of keeping with the people who come here; I was quite right not to make friends with her, wasn�t I?�  ���Whether from independence or because he was tired, M. de Norpois replied merely in a bow full of respect but devoid of meaning.  ��� �Sir,� went on Mme. de Villeparisis with a laugh, �there are some absurd people in the world. Would you believe that I had a visit this afternoon from a gentleman who tried to persuade me that he found more pleasure in kissing my hand than a young woman�s?�  ���I guessed at once that this was Legrandin. M. de Norpois smiled with a slight quiver of the eyelid, as though such a remark had been prompted by a concupiscence so natural that one could not find fault with the person who had uttered it, almost as though it were the beginning of a romance which he was prepared to forgive, if not to encourage, with the perverse indulgence of a Voisenon or the younger Cr�billon.  ��� �Many young women�s hands would be incapable of doing what I see there,� said the Prince, pointing to Mme. de Villeparisis�s unfinished water-colours. And he asked her whether she had seen the flower paintings by Fantin-Latour which had recently been exhibited.  ��� �They are of the first order, and indicate, as people say nowadays, a fine painter, one of the masters of the palette,� declared M. de Norpois; �I consider, all the same, that they stand no comparison with these, in which I find it easier to recognise the colouring of the flower.�  ���Even supposing that the partiality of an old lover, the habit of flattering people, the critical standard admissible in a small circle, had dictated this speech to the ex-Ambassador, it proved upon what an absolute vacuum of true taste the judgment of people in society is based, so arbitrary that the smallest trifle can make it rush to the wildest absurdities, on the way to which it is stopped, held up by no genuinely felt impression.  ��� �I claim no credit for knowing about flowers, I�ve lived all my life among the fields,� replied Mme. de Villeparisis modestly. �But,� she added graciously, turning to the Prince, �if I did, when I was quite a girl, form a rather more serious idea of them than children generally do in the country, I owe that to a distinguished fellow-countryman of yours, Herr von Schlegel. I met him at Broglie, when I was staying there once with my aunt Cordelia (Marshal de Castellane�s wife, don�t you know?). I remember so well M. Lebrun, M. de Salvandy, M. Doudan, getting him to talk about flowers. I was only a little girl, I wasn�t able to follow all he said. But he liked playing with me, and when he went back to your country he sent me a beautiful botany book to remind me of a drive we took together in a phaeton to the Val Richer, when I fell asleep on his knee. I have got the book still, and it taught me to observe many things about flowers which I should not have noticed otherwise. When Mme. de Barante published some of Mme. de Broglie�s letters, charming and affected like herself, I hoped to find among them some record of those conversations with Herr von Schlegel. But she was a woman who looked for nothing from nature but arguments in support of religion.�  ���Robert called me away to the far end of the room where he and his mother were.  ��� �You have been good to me,� I said, �how can I thank you? Can we dine together to-morrow?�  ��� �To-morrow? Yes, if you like, but it will have to be with Bloch. I met him just now on the doorstep; he was rather stiff with me at first because I had quite forgotten to answer his last two letters. (At least, he didn�t tell me that that was what had annoyed him, but I guessed it.) But after that he was so friendly to me that I simply can�t disappoint him. Between ourselves, on his side at least, I can feel it�s a life and death friendship.� Nor do I consider that Robert was altogether mistaken. Furious detraction was often, with Bloch, the effect of a keen affection which he had supposed to be unreturned. And as he had little power of imagining the lives of other people, and never dreamed that one might have been ill, or away from home, or otherwise occupied, a week�s silence was at once interpreted by him as meaning a deliberate coldness. And so I have never believed that his most violent outbursts as a friend, or in later years as a writer, went very deep. They rose to a paroxysm if one replied to them with an icy dignity, or by a platitude which encouraged him to redouble his onslaught, but yielded often to a warmly sympathetic attitude. �As for being good,� went on Saint-Loup, �you say I have been to you, but I haven�t been good at all, my aunt tells me that it�s you who avoid her, that you never said a word to her. She wondered whether you had anything against her.�  ���Fortunately for myself, if I had been taken in by this speech, our departure, which I believed to be imminent, for Balbec would have prevented my making any attempt to see Mme. Guermantes again, to assure her that I had nothing against her, and so to put her under the necessity of proving that it was she who had something against me. But I had only to remind myself that she had not even offered to let me see her Elstirs. Besides, this was not a disappointment; I had never expected her to begin talking to me about them; I knew that I did not appeal to her, that I need have no hope of ever making her like me; the most that I had been able to look forward to was that, thanks to her kindness, I might there and then receive, since I should not be seeing her again before I left Paris, an entirely pleasing impression, which I could take with me to Balbec indefinitely prolonged, intact, instead of a memory broken by anxiety and sorrow.  ���Mme. de Marsantes kept on interrupting her conversation with Robert to tell me how often he had spoken to her about me, how fond he was of me; she treated me with a deference which almost hurt me because I felt it to be prompted by her fear of being embroiled, on my account, with this son whom she had not seen all day, with whom she was eager to be alone, and over whom she must accordingly have supposed that the influence which she wielded was not equal to and must conciliate mine. Having heard me, earlier in the afternoon, make some reference to Bloch�s uncle, M. Nissim Bernard, Mme. de Marsantes inquired whether it was he who had at one time lived at Nice.  ��� �In that case, he knew M. de Marsantes there before our marriage,� she told me. �My husband used often to speak of him as an excellent man, with such a delicate, generous nature.�  ��� �To think that for once in his life he wasn�t lying! It�s incredible,� would have been Bloch�s comment.  ���All this time I should have liked to explain to Mme. de Marsantes that Robert felt infinitely more affection for her than for myself, and that had she shewn any hostility towards me it was not in my nature to attempt to set him against her, to detach him from her. But now that Mme. de Guermantes had left the room, I had more leisure to observe Robert, and I noticed then for the first time that, once again, a sort of flood of anger seemed to be coursing through him, rising to the surface of his stern and sombre features. I was afraid lest, remembering the scene in the theatre that afternoon, he might be feeling humiliated in my presence at having allowed himself to be treated so harshly by his mistress without making any rejoinder.  ���Suddenly he broke away from his mother, who had put her arm round his neck, and, coming towards me, led me behind the little flower-strewn counter at which Mme. de Villeparisis had resumed her seat, making a sign to me to follow him into the smaller room. I was hurrying after him when M. de Charlus, who must have supposed that I was leaving the house, turned abruptly from Prince von Faffenheim, to whom he had been talking, and made a rapid circuit which brought him face to face with me. I saw with alarm that he had taken the hat in the lining of which were a capital �G� and a ducal coronet. In the doorway into the little room he said, without looking at me:  ��� �As I see that you have taken to going into society, you must do me the pleasure of coming to see me. But it�s a little complicated,� he went on with a distracted, calculating air, as if the pleasure had been one that he was afraid of not securing again once he had let slip the opportunity of arranging with me the means by which it might be realised. �I am very seldom at home; you will have to write to me. But I should prefer to explain things to you more quietly. I am just going. Will you walk a short way with me? I shall only keep you a moment.�  ��� �You�d better take care, sir,� I warned him; �you have picked up the wrong hat by mistake.�  ��� �Do you want to stop me taking my own hat?� I assumed, a similar mishap having recently occurred to myself, that someone else having taken his hat he had seized upon one at random, so as not to go home bare-headed, and that I had placed him in a difficulty by exposing his stratagem. I told him that I must say a few words to Saint-Loup. �He is still talking to that idiot the Duc de Guermantes,� I added. �That really is charming; I shall tell my brother.� �Oh! you think that would interest M. de Charlus?� (I imagined that, if he had a brother, that brother must be called Charlus also. Saint-Loup had indeed explained his family tree to me at Balbec, but I had forgotten the details.) �Who has been talking to you about M. de Charlus?� replied the Baron in an arrogant tone. �Go to Robert.�  ��� �I hear,� he went on, �that you took part this morning in one of those orgies that he has with a woman who is disgracing him. You would do well to use your influence with him to make him realise the pain he is causing his poor mother, and all of us, by dragging our name in the dirt.�  ���I should have liked to reply that at this degrading luncheon the conversation had been entirely about Emerson, Ibsen and Tolstoy, and that the young woman had lectured Robert to make him drink nothing but water. In the hope of bringing some balm to Robert, whose pride had, I felt, been wounded, I sought to find an excuse for his mistress. I did not know that at that moment, in spite of his anger with her, it was on himself that he was heaping reproaches. But it always happens, even in quarrels between a good man and a worthless woman, and when the right is all on one side, that some trifle crops up which enables the woman to appear not to have been in the wrong on one point. And as she ignores all the other points, the moment the man begins to feel the need of her company, or is demoralised by separation from her, his weakness will make his conscience more exacting, he will remember the absurd reproaches that have been flung at him and will ask himself whether they have not some foundation in fact.  ��� �I�ve come to the conclusion I was wrong about that matter of the necklace,� Robert said to me. �Of course, I never meant for a moment to do anything wrong, but, I know very well, other people don�t look at things in the same way as oneself. She had a very hard time when she was young. In her eyes, I was bound to appear just the rich man who thinks he can get anything he wants with his money, and with whom a poor person cannot compete, whether in trying to influence Boucheron or in a lawsuit. Of course she has been horribly cruel to me, when I have never thought of anything but her good. But I do see clearly, she believes that I wanted to make her feel that one could keep a hold on her with money, and that�s not true. And she�s so fond of me; what must she be thinking of me? Poor darling, if you only knew, she has such charming ways, I simply can�t tell you, she has often done the most adorable things for me. How wretched she must be feeling now! In any case, whatever happens in the long run, I don�t want to let her think me a cad; I shall dash off to Boucheron�s and get the necklace. You never know; very likely when she sees me with it, she will admit that she�s been in the wrong. Don�t you see, it�s the idea that she is suffering at this moment that I can�t bear. What one suffers oneself one knows; that�s nothing. But with her � to say to oneself that she�s suffering and not to be able to form any idea of what she feels � I think I shall go mad in a minute � I�d much rather never see her again than let her suffer. She can be happy without me, if she must; that�s all I ask. Listen; you know, to me everything that concerns her is enormously important, it becomes something cosmic; I shall run to the jeweller�s and then go and ask her to forgive me. But until I get down there what will she be thinking of me? If she could only know that I was on my way! What about your going down there and telling her? For all we know, that might settle the whole business. Perhaps,� he went on with a smile, as though he hardly ventured to believe in so idyllic a possibility, �we can all three dine together in the country. But we can�t tell yet. I never know how to handle her. Poor child. I shall perhaps only hurt her more than ever. Besides, her decision may be irrevocable.�  ���Robert swept me back to his mother.  ��� �Good-bye,� he said to her. �I�ve got to go now. I don�t know when I shall get leave again. Probably not for a month. I shall write as soon as I know myself.�  ���Certainly Robert was not in the least of the type of son who, when he goes out with his mother, feels that an attitude of exasperation towards her ought to balance the smiles and bows which he bestows on strangers. Nothing is more common than this odious form of vengeance on the part of those who appear to believe that rudeness to one�s own family is the natural complement to one�s ceremonial behaviour. Whatever the wretched mother may say, her son, as though he had been taken to the house against his will and wished to make her pay dearly for his presence, refutes immediately, with an ironical, precise, cruel contradiction, the timidly ventured assertion; the mother at once conforms, though without thereby disarming him, to the opinion of this superior being of whom she will continue to boast to everyone, when he is not present, as having a charming nature, and who all the same spares her none of his keenest thrusts. Saint-Loup was not at all like this; but the anguish which Rachel�s absence provoked in him brought it about that, for different reasons, he was no less harsh with his mother than the sons I have been describing are with theirs. And as she listened to him I saw the same throb, like that of a mighty wing, which Mme. de Marsantes had been unable to repress when her son first entered the room, convulse her whole body once again; but this time it was an anxious face, eyes wide with grief that she fastened on him.  ��� �What, Robert, you�re going away? Seriously? My little son! The one day I�ve seen anything of you!�  ���And then quite softly, in the most natural tone, in a voice from which she strove to banish all sadness so as not to inspire her son with a pity which would perhaps have been painful to him, or else useless and might serve only to irritate him, like an argument prompted by plain common sense she added:  ��� �You know, it�s not at all nice of you.�  ���But to this simplicity she added so much timidity, to shew him that she was not trespassing on his freedom, so much affection, so that he should not reproach her with spoiling his pleasures, that Saint-Loup could not fail to observe in himself as it were the possibility of a similar wave of affection, that was to say an obstacle to his spending the evening with his lady. And so he grew angry.  ��� �It�s unfortunate, but, nice or not, that�s how it is.�  ���And he heaped on his mother the reproaches which no doubt he felt that he himself perhaps deserved; thus it is that egoists have always the last word; having laid down at the start that their determination is unshakeable, the more the sentiment in them to which one appeals to make them abandon it is touched, the more fault they find, not with themselves who resist the appeal but with those persons who put them under the necessity of resisting it, with the result that their own firmness may be carried to the utmost degree of cruelty, which only aggravates all the more in their eyes the culpability of the person who is so indelicate as to be hurt, to be in the right, and to cause them thus treacherously the pain of acting against their natural instinct of pity. But of her own accord Mme. de Marsantes ceased to insist, for she felt that she would not be able to keep him.  ��� �I shall leave you here,� he said to me, �but you�re not to keep him long, Mamma, because he�s got to go somewhere else in a minute.�  ���I was fully aware that my company could not afford any pleasure to Mme. de Marsantes, but I preferred, by not going with Robert, not to let her suppose that I was involved in these pleasures which deprived her of him. I should have liked to find some excuse for her son�s conduct, less from affection for him than from pity tor her. But it was she who spoke first.  ��� �Poor boy,� she began, �I am sure I must have hurt him dreadfully. You see, Sir, mothers are such selfish creatures, after all he hasn�t many pleasures, he comes so little to Paris. Oh, dear, if he hadn�t gone already I should have liked to stop him, not to keep him of course, but just to tell him that I�m not vexed with him, that I think he was quite right. Will you excuse me if I go and look over the staircase?�  ���I accompanied her there.  ��� �Robert! Robert!� she called. �No; he�s gone; we are too late.�  ���At that moment I would as gladly have undertaken a mission to make Robert break with his mistress as, a few hours earlier, to make him go and live with her altogether. In one case Saint-Loup would have regarded me as a false friend, in the other his family would have called me his evil genius. Yet I was the same man, at an interval of a few hours.  ���We returned to the drawing-room. Seeing that Saint-Loup was not with us, Mme. de Villeparisis exchanged with M. de Norpois that dubious, derisive and not too pitying glance with which people point out to one another an over-jealous wife or an over-loving mother (spectacles which to outsiders are amusing), as much as to say: �There now, there�s been trouble.�  ���Robert went to his mistress, taking with him the splendid ornament which, after what had been said on both sides, he ought not to have given her. But it came to the same thing, for she would not look at it, and even after their reconciliation he could never persuade her to accept it. Certain of Robert�s friends thought that these proofs of disinterestedness which she furnished were deliberately planned to draw him closer to her. And yet she was not greedy about money, except perhaps to be able to spend it without thought. I have seen her bestow recklessly on people whom she believed to be in need the most insensate charity. �At this moment,� Robert�s friends would say to him, seeking to balance by their malicious words a disinterested action on Rachel�s part, �at this moment she will be in the promenade at the Folies-Berg�res. She�s an enigma, that girl is, a regular sphinx.� After all, how many women who are not disinterested, since they are kept by men, have we not seen, with a delicacy that flowers from their sordid existence, set with their own hands a thousand little limits to the generosity of their lovers?  ���Robert knew of scarcely any of the infidelities of his mistress, and tortured his mind over what were mere nothings compared with the real life of Rachel, a life which began every day only after he had left her. He knew of scarcely any of these infidelities. One could have told him of them without shaking his confidence in Rachel. For it is a charming law of nature which manifests itself in the heart of the most complex social organisms, that we live in perfect ignorance of those we love. On one side of the mirror the lover says to himself: �She is an angel, she will never yield herself to me, I may as well die � and yet she does care for me; she cares so much that perhaps � but no, it can never possibly happen.� And in the exaltation of his desire, in the anguish of waiting, what jewels he flings at the feet of this woman, how he runs to borrow money to save her from inconvenience; meanwhile, on the other side of the screen, through which their conversation will no more carry than that which visitors exchange outside the glass wall of an aquarium, the public are saying: �You don�t know her? I congratulate you, she has robbed, in fact ruined I don�t know how many men. There isn�t a worse girl in Paris. She�s a common swindler. And cunning isn�t the word!� And perhaps the public are not entirely wrong in their use of the last epithet, for indeed the sceptical man who is not really in love with the woman and whom she merely attracts says to his friends: �No, no, my dear fellow, she is not in the least a prostitute; I don�t say she hasn�t had an adventure or two in her time, but she�s not a woman one pays, she�d be a damned sight too expensive if she was. With her it�s fifty thousand francs or nothing.� Well, he has spent fifty thousand francs on her, he has had her once, but she (finding, moreover, a willing accomplice in the man himself) has managed to persuade him that he is one of those who have had her for nothing. Such is society, in which every one of us has two aspects, in which the most obvious, the most notorious faults will never be known by a certain other person save embedded in, under the protection of a shell, a smooth cocoon, a delicious curiosity of nature. There were in Paris two thoroughly respectable men to whom Saint-Loup no longer bowed, and could not refer without a tremor in his voice, calling them exploiters of women: this was because they had both been ruined by Rachel.  ��� �I blame myself for one thing only,� Mme. de Marsantes murmured in my ear, �and that was my telling him that he wasn�t nice to me. He, such an adorable, unique son, there�s no one else like him in the world, the only time I see him, to have told him he wasn�t nice to me, I would far rather he�d beaten me, because I am sure that whatever pleasure he may be having this evening, and he hasn�t many, will be spoiled for him by that unfair word. But, Sir, I mustn�t keep you, since you�re in a hurry.�  ���Anxiously, Mme. de Marsantes bade me good-bye. These sentiments bore upon Robert; she was sincere. But she ceased to be, to become a great lady once more.  ��� �I have been so interested, so glad to have this little talk with you. Thank you! Thank you!�  ���And with a humble air she fastened on me a look of gratitude, of exhilaration, as though my conversation were one of the keenest pleasures that she had experienced in her life. These charming glances went very well with the black flowers on her white skirt; they were those of a great lady who knew her business.  ��� �But I am in no hurry,� I replied; �besides, I must wait for M. de Charlus; I am going with him.�  ���Mme. de Villeparisis overheard these last words. They appeared to vex her. Had the matter in question not been one which could not possibly give rise to such a sentiment, it might have struck me that what seemed to be at that moment alarmed in Mme. de Villeparisis was her modesty. But this hypothesis never even entered my mind. I was delighted with Mme. de Guermantes, with Saint-Loup, with Mme. de Marsantes, with M. de Charlus, with Mme. de Villeparisis; I did not stop to reflect, and I spoke light-heartedly and at random.  ��� �You�re going from here with my nephew Palam�de?� she asked me.  ���Thinking that it might produce a highly favourable impression on Mme. de Villeparisis if she learned that I was on intimate terms with a nephew whom she esteemed so greatly, �He has asked me to go home with him,� I answered blithely. �I am so glad. Besides, we are greater friends than you think, and I�ve quite made up my mind that we�re going to be better friends still.�  ���From being vexed, Mme. de Villeparisis seemed to have grown anxious. �Don�t wait for him,� she said to me, with a preoccupied air. �He is talking to M. de Faffenheim. He�s certain to have forgotten what he said to you. You�d much better go, now, quickly, while his back is turned.�  ���The first emotion shewn by Mme. de Villeparisis would have suggested, but for the circumstances, offended modesty. Her insistence, her opposition might well, if one had studied her face alone, have appeared to be dictated by virtue. I was not, myself, in any hurry to join Robert and his mistress. But Mme. de Villeparisis seemed to make such a point of my going that, thinking perhaps that she had some important business to discuss with her nephew, I bade her good-bye. Next to her M. de Guermantes, superb and Olympian, was ponderously seated. One would have said that the notion omnipresent in all his members, of his vast riches gave him a particular high density, as though they had been melted in a crucible into a single human ingot to form this man whose value was so immense. At the moment of my saying good-bye to him he rose politely from his seat, and I could feel the dead weight of thirty millions which his old-fashioned French breeding set in motion, raised, until it stood before me. I seemed to be looking at that statue of Olympian Zeus which Phidias is said to have cast in solid gold. Such was the power that good breeding had over M. de Guermantes over the body of M. de Guermantes at least, for it had not an equal mastery over the ducal mind. M. de Guermantes laughed at his own jokes, but did not unbend to other people�s.  ���As I went downstairs I heard behind me a voice calling out to me:  ��� �So this is how you wait for me, is it?�  ���It was M. de Charlus.  ��� �You don�t mind if we go a little way on foot?� he asked dryly, when we were in the courtyard. �We can walk until I find a cab that suits me.�  ��� �You wished to speak to me about something, Sir?�  ��� �Oh yes, as a matter of fact there were some things I wished to say to you, but I am not so sure now whether I shall. As far as you are concerned, I am sure that they might be the starting-point which would lead you to inestimable benefits. But I can see also that they would bring into my existence, at an age when one begins to value tranquillity, a great loss of time, great inconvenience. I ask myself whether you are worth all the pains that I should have to take with you, and I have not the pleasure of knowing you well enough to be able to say. Perhaps also to you yourself what I could do for you does not appear sufficiently attractive for me to give, myself so much trouble, for I repeat quite frankly that for me it can only be trouble.�  ���I protested that, in that case, he must not dream of it. This summary end to the discussion did not seem to be to his liking.  ��� �That sort of politeness means nothing,� he rebuked me coldly. �There is nothing so pleasant as to give oneself trouble for a person who is worth one�s while. For the best of us, the study of the arts, a taste for old things, collections, gardens are all mere ersatz, succedanea, alibis. In the heart of our tub, like Diogenes, we cry out for a man. We cultivate begonias, we trim yews, as a last resort, because yews and begonias submit to treatment. But we should like to give our time to a plant of human growth, if we were sure that he was worth the trouble. That is the whole question: you must know something about yourself. Are you worth my trouble or not?�  ��� �I would not for anything in the world, Sir, be a cause of anxiety to you,� I said to him, �but so far as I am concerned you may be sure that everything which comes to me from you will be a very great pleasure to me. I am deeply touched that you should be so kind as to take notice of me in this way and try to help me.�  ���Greatly to my surprise, it was almost with effusion that he thanked me for this speech, slipping his arm through mine with that intermittent familiarity which had already struck me at Balbec, and was in such contrast to the coldness of his tone.  ��� �With the want of consideration common at your age,� he told me, �you are liable to say things at times which would open an unbridgeable gulf between us. What you have said just now, on the other hand, is exactly the sort of thing that touches me, and makes me want to do a great deal for you.�  ���As he walked arm in arm with me and uttered these words, which, albeit tinged with contempt, were so affectionate, M. de Charlus now fastened his gaze on me with that intense fixity which had struck me the first morning, when I saw him outside the casino at Balbec, and indeed many years before that, through the pink hawthorns, standing beside Mme. Swann, whom I supposed then to be his mistress, in the park at Tansonville; now let it stray around him and examine the cabs which at this time of the day were passing in considerable numbers on the way to their stables, looking so determinedly at them that several stopped, the drivers supposing that he wished to engage them. But M. de Charlus immediately dismissed them.  ��� �They�re not what I want,� he explained to me, �it�s all a question of the colour of their lamps, and the direction they�re going in. I hope, Sir,� he went on, �that you will not in any way misinterpret the purely disinterested and charitable nature of the proposal which I am going to make to you.�  ���I was struck by the similarity of his diction to Swann�s, closer now than at Balbec.  ��� �You have enough intelligence, I suppose, not to imagine that it is from want of society, from any fear of solitude and boredom that I have recourse to you. I do not, as a rule, care to talk about myself, but you may possibly have heard � it was alluded to in a leading article in The Times, which made a considerable impression � that the Emperor of Austria, who has always honoured me with his friendship, and is good enough to insist on keeping up terms of cousinship with me, declared the other day in an interview which was made public that if the Comte de Chambord had had by his side a man as thoroughly conversant with the undercurrents of European politics as myself he would be King of France to-day. I have often thought, Sir, that there was in me, thanks not to my own humble talents but to circumstances which you may one day have occasion to learn, a sort of secret record of incalculable value, of which I have not felt myself at liberty to make use, personally, but which would be a priceless acquisition to a young man to whom I would hand over in a few months what it has taken me more than thirty years to collect, what I am perhaps alone in possessing. I do not speak of the intellectual enjoyment which you would find in learning certain secrets which a Michelet of our day would give years of his life to know, and in the light of which certain events would assume for him an entirely different aspect. And I do not speak only of events that have already occurred, but of the chain of circumstances.� (This was a favourite expression with M. de Charlus, and often, when he used it, he joined his hands as if in prayer, but with his fingers stiffened, as though to illustrate by their complexity the said circumstances, which he did not specify, and the chain that linked them.) �I could give you an explanation that no one has dreamed of, not only of the past but of the future.� M. de Charlus broke off to question me about Bloch, whom he had heard discussed, though without appearing to be listening, in his aunt�s drawing-room. And with that ironical accent he so skilfully detached what he was saying that he seemed to be thinking of something else altogether and to be speaking mechanically, simply out of politeness. He asked if my friend was young, good looking and so forth. Bloch, if he had heard him would have been more puzzled even than with M. de Norpois, but for very different reasons, to know whether M. de Charlus was for or against Drey, fus. �It is not a bad idea, if you wish to learn about life,� went on M. de Charlus when he had finished questioning me, �to include among your friends an occasional foreigner.� I replied that Bloch was French. �Indeed,� said M. de Charlus, �I took him to be a Jew.� His assertion of this incompatibility made me suppose that M. de Charlus was more anti-Dreyfusard than anyone I had met. He protested, however, against the charge of treason levelled against Dreyfus. But his protest took this form: �I understand the newspapers to say that Dreyfus has committed a crime against his country � so I understand, I pay no attention to the newspapers, I read them as I wash my hands, without finding that it is worth my while to take any interest in what I am doing. In any case, the crime is non-existent, your friend�s compatriot would have committed a crime if he had betrayed Judaea, but what has he to do with France?� I pointed out that if there should be a war the Jews would be mobilised just as much as anyone else. �Perhaps so, and I am not sure that it would not be an imprudence. If we bring over Senegalese and Malagasies, I hardly suppose that their hearts will be in the task of defending France, which is only natural. Your Dreyfus might rather be convicted of a breach of the laws of hospitality. But we need not discuss that. Perhaps you could ask your friend to allow me to be present at some great festival in the Temple, at a circumcision, with Jewish chants. He might perhaps take a hall, and give me some biblical entertainment, as the young ladies of Saint-Cyr performed scenes taken from the Psalms by Racine, to amuse Louis XIV. You might even arrange parties to give us a good laugh. For instance a battle between your friend and his father, in which he would smite him as David smote Goliath. That would make quite an amusing farce. He might even, while he was about it, deal some stout blows at his hag (or, as my old nurse would say, his �haggart�) of a mother. That would be an excellent show, and would not be unpleasing to us, eh, my young friend, since we like exotic spectacles, and to thrash that non-European creature would be giving a well-earned punishment to an old camel.� As he poured out this terrible, almost insane language, M. de Charlus squeezed my arm until it ached. I reminded myself of all that his family had told me of his wonderful kindness to this old nurse, whose Moli�resque vocabulary he had just quoted, and thought to myself that the connexions, hitherto, I felt, little studied, between goodness and wickedness in the same heart, various as they might be, would be an interesting subject for research.  ���I warned him that, anyhow, Mme. Bloch no longer existed, while as for M. Bloch, I questioned to what extent he would enjoy a sport which might easily result in his being blinded. M. de Charlus seemed annoyed. �That,� he said, �is a woman who made a great mistake in dying. As for blinding him, surely the Synagogue is blind, it does not perceive the truth of the Gospel. In any case, think, at this moment, when all these unhappy Jews are trembling before the stupid fury of the Christians, what an honour it would be for him to see a man like myself condescend to be amused by their sports.� At this point I caught sight of M. Bloch senior, who was coming towards us, probably on his way to meet his son. He did not see us but I offered to introduce him to M. de Charlus. I had no conception of the torrent of rage which my words were to let loose. �Introduce him to me! But you must have singularly little idea of social values! People do not get to know me as easily as that. In the present instance, the awkwardness would be twofold, on account of the youth of the introducer and the unworthiness of the person introduced. At the most, if I am ever permitted to enjoy the Asiatic spectacle which I suggested to you, I might address to the horrible creature a few words indicative of generous feeling. But on condition that he allows himself to be thoroughly thrashed by his son, I might go so far as to express my satisfaction.� As it happened, M. Bloch paid no attention to us. He was occupied in greeting Mme. Sazerat with a series of sweeping bows, which were very favourably received. I was surprised at this, for in the old days at Combray she had been indignant at my parents for having young Bloch in the house, so anti-semitic was she then. But Dreyfusism, like a strong gust of wind, had, a few days before this, wafted M. Bloch to her feet. My father�s friend had found Mme. Sazerat charming and was particularly gratified by the anti-semitism of the lady, which he regarded as a proof of the sincerity of her faith and the soundness of her Dreyfusard opinions, and also as enhancing the value of the call which she had authorised him to pay her. He had not even been offended when she had said to him stolidly: �M. Drumont has the impudence to put the Revisionists in the same bag as the Protestants and the Jews. A delightful promiscuity!� �Bernard,� he had said with pride, on reaching home, to M. Nissim Bernard, �you know, she has that prejudice!� But M. Nissim Bernard had said nothing, only raising his eyes to heaven in an angelic gaze. Saddened by the misfortunes of the Jews, remembering his old friendships with Christians, grown mannered and precious with increasing years, for reasons which the reader will learn in due course, he had now the air of a pre-Raphaelite ghost on to which hair had been incongruously grafted, like threads in the heart of an opal. �All this Dreyfus business,� went on the Baron, still clasping me by the arm, �has only one drawback. It destroys society (I do not say polite society; society has long ceased to deserve that laudatory epithet) by the influx of Mr. and Mrs. Camels and Camelfies and Camelyards, astonishing creatures whom I find even in the houses of my own cousins, because they belong to the Patrie Fran�aise, or the Anti-Jewish, or some such league, as if a political opinion entitled one to any social qualification.� This frivolity in M. de Charlus brought out his family likeness to the Duchesse de Guermantes.  ���I remarked to him on the resemblance. As he appeared to think that I did not know her, I reminded him of the evening at the Opera when he had seemed to be trying to avoid me. He assured me with such insistence that he had never even seen me there that I should have begun to believe him, if presently a trifling incident had not led me to think that M. de Charlus, in his excessive pride perhaps, did not care to be seen with me.  ��� �Let us return to yourself,� he said, �and my plans for you. There exists among certain men, Sir, a freemasonry of which I cannot now say more than that it numbers in its ranks four of the reigning sovereigns of Europe Now, the courtiers of one of these are trying to cure him of his fancy. That is a very serious matter, and may bring us to war. Yes, Sir, that is a fact You remember the story of the man who believed that he had the Princess of China shut up in a bottle. It was a form of insanity. He was cured of it, But as soon as he ceased to be mad he became merely stupid. There are maladies which we must not seek to cure because they alone protect us from others that are more serious. A cousin of mine had trouble with his stomach; he could not digest anything. The most learned specialists on the stomach treated him, with no effect. I took him to a certain doctor (another highly interesting man, by the way, of whom I could tell you a great deal). He guessed at once that the trouble was nervousness; he persuaded his patient, ordered him to eat whatever he liked quite boldly and assured him that his digestion would stand it. But my cousin had nephritis also. What the stomach can digest perfectly well the kidneys cease, after a time, to eliminate, and my cousin, instead of living to a good old age with an imaginary disease of the stomach which obliged him to keep to a diet, died at forty with his stomach cured but his kidneys ruined. Given a very considerable advantage over people of your age, for all one knows, you will perhaps become what some eminent man of the past might have been if a good angel had revealed to him, in the midst of a humanity that knew nothing of them, the secrets of steam and electricity. Do not be foolish, do not refuse from discretion. Understand that, if I do you a great service, I expect my reward from you to be no less great. It is many years now since people in society ceased to interest me. I have but one passion left, to seek to redeem the mistakes of my life by conferring the benefit of my knowledge on a soul that is still virgin and capable of being inflamed by virtue. I have had great sorrows, Sir, of which I may tell you perhaps some day; I have lost my wife, who was the loveliest, the noblest, the most perfect creature that one could dream of seeing. I have young relatives who are not � I do not say worthy, but who are not capable of accepting the moral heritage of which I have been speaking. For all I know, you may be he into whose hands it is to pass, he whose life I shall be able to direct and to raise to so lofty a plane. My own would gain in return. Perhaps in teaching you the great secrets of diplomacy I might recover a taste for them myself, and begin at last to do things of real interest in which you would have an equal share. But before I can tell I must see you often, very often, every day.�  ���I was thinking of taking advantage of this unexpected kindness on M. de Charlus�s part to ask him whether he could not arrange for me to meet his sister-in-law when, suddenly, I felt my arm violently jerked, as though by an electric shock. It was M. de Charlus who had hurriedly withdrawn his arm from mine. Although as he talked he had allowed his eyes to wander in all directions he had only just caught sight of M. d�Argencourt, who was coming towards us from a side street. On seeing us, M. d�Argencourt appeared worried, cast at me a look of distrust, almost that look intended for a creature of another race than one�s own with which Mme. de Guermantes had quizzed Bloch, and tried to avoid us. But one would have said that M. de Charlus was determined to shew him that he was not at all anxious not to be seen by him, for he called to him, simply to tell him something that was of no importance. And fearing perhaps that M. d�Argencourt had not recognised me, M. de Charlus informed him that I was a great friend of Mme. de Villeparisis, of the Duchesse de Guermantes, of Robert de Saint-Loup, and that he himself, Charlus, was an old friend of my grandmother, and glad to be able to shew her grandson a little of the affection that he felt for her. Nevertheless I observed that M. d�Argencourt, albeit I had barely been introduced to him at Mme. de Villeparisis�s, and M. de Charlus had now spoken to him at great length about my family, was distinctly colder to me than he had been in the afternoon; and for a long time he shewed the same aloofness whenever we met. He watched me now with a curiosity in which there was no sign of friendliness, and seemed even to have to overcome an instinctive repulsion when, on leaving us, after a moment�s hesitation, he held out a hand to me which he at once withdrew.  ��� �I am sorry about that,� said M. de Charlus. �That fellow Argencourt, well born but ill bred, more than feeble as a diplomat, an impossible husband, always running after women like a person in a play, is one of those men who are incapable of understanding but perfectly capable of destroying the things in life that are really great. I hope that our friendship will be one of them, if it is ever to be formed, and I hope also that you will honour me by keeping it � as I shall � well clear of the heels of any of those donkeys who, from idleness or clumsiness or deliberate wickedness trample upon what would seem to have been made to endure. Unfortunately, that is the mould in which most of the men one meets have been cast.�  ��� �The Duchesse de Guermantes seems to be very clever. We were talking this afternoon about the possibility of war. It appears that she is specially well informed on that subject.�  ��� �She is nothing of the sort,� replied M. de Charlus tartly. �Women, and most men, for that matter, understand nothing of what I was going to tell you. My sister-in-law is a charming woman who imagines that we are still living in the days of Balzac�s novels, when women had an influence on Politics. Going to her house could at present have only a bad effect on you, as for that matter going anywhere. That was one of the very things I was just going to tell you when that fool interrupted me. The first sacrifice that you must make for me � I shall claim them from you in proportion to the gifts I bestow on you � is to give up going into society. It distressed me this afternoon to see you at that idiotic tea-party. You may remind me that I Was there myself, but for me it was not a social gathering, it was simply a family visit. Later on, when you have established your position, if it amuses you to step down for a little into that sort of thing, it may perhaps, do no harm. And then, I need not point out how invaluable I can be to you. The �Open Sesame� to the Guermantes house and any others that it is worth while throwing open the doors of to you, rests with me I shall be the judge, and intend to remain master of the situation.�  ���I thought I would take advantage of what M. de Charlus had said about my call on Mme. de Villeparisis to try to find out what position exactly she occupied in society, but the question took another form on my lips than I had intended, and I asked him instead what the Villeparisis family was.  ��� �That is absolutely as though you had asked me what the Nobody family was,� replied M. de Charlus. �My aunt married, for love, a M Thirion, who was extremely rich, for that matter, and whose sisters had married surprisingly well; and from that day onwards he called himself Marquis de Villeparisis. It did no harm to anyone, at the most a little to himself, and very little! What his reason was I cannot tell; I suppose he was actually a �Monsieur de Villeparisis,� a gentleman born at Villeparisis, which as you know is the name of a little place outside Paris. My aunt tried to make out that there was such a Marquisate in the family, she wanted to put things on a proper footing; I can�t tell you why. When one takes a name to which one has no right it is better not to copy the regular forms.�  ���Mme. de Villeparisis being merely Mme. Thirion completed the fall which had begun in my estimation of her when I had seen the composite nature of her party. I felt it to be unfair that a woman whose title and name were of quite recent origin should be able thus to impose upon her contemporaries, with the prospect of similarly imposing upon posterity, by virtue of her friendships with royal personages. Now that she had become once again what I had supposed her to be in my childhood, a person who had nothing aristocratic about her, these distinguished kinsfolk who gathered round her seemed to remain alien to her. She did not cease to be charming to us all. I went occasionally to see her and she sent me little presents from time to time. But I had never any impression that she belonged to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and if I had wanted any information about it she would have been one of the last people to whom I should have applied.  ��� �At present,� went on M. de Charlus, �by going into society, you will only damage your position, warp your intellect and character. Also, you must be particularly careful in choosing your friends. Keep mistresses, if your family have no objection, that doesn�t concern me, indeed I can only advise it, you young rascal, young rascal who will soon have to start shaving,� he rallied me, passing his fingers over my chin. �But the choice of your men friends is more important. Eight out of ten young men are little scoundrels, little wretches capable of doing you an injury which you will never be able to repair. Wait, now, my nephew Saint-Loup is quite a suitable companion for you, at a pinch. As far as your future is concerned, he can be of no possible use to you, but for that I am sufficient. And really when all�s said and done, as a person to go about with, at times when you have had enough of me, he does not seem to present any serious drawback that I know of. At any rate he is a man, not one of those effeminate creatures one sees so many of nowadays, who look like little renters, and at any moment may bring their innocent victims to the gallows.� I did not know the meaning of this slang word �renter�; anyone who had known it would have been as greatly surprised by his use of it as myself. People in society always like talking slang, and people against whom certain things may be hinted like to shew that they are not afraid to mention them. A proof of innocence in their eyes. But they have lost their sense of proportion, they are no longer capable of realising the point at which a certain pleasantry will become too technical, too shocking, will be a proof rather of corruption than of simplicity. �He is not like the rest of them; he has nice manners; he is really serious.�  ���I could not help smiling at this epithet �serious,� to which the intonation that M. de Charlus gave to it seemed to impart the sense of �virtuous,� of �steady,� as one says of a little shop-girl that she is �serious.� At this moment a cab passed, zigzagging along the street; a young cabman, who had deserted his box, was driving it from inside, where he lay sprawling upon the cushions, apparently half drunk. M. de Charlus instantly stopped him. The driver began to argue.  ��� �Which way are you going?�  ��� �Yours.� This surprised me, for M. de Charlus had already refused several cabs with similarly coloured lamps.  ��� �Well, I don�t want to get up on the box. D�you mind if I stay down here?�  ��� �No; but you must put down the hood. Well, think over my proposal,� said M. de Charlus, preparing to leave me, �I give you a few days to consider my offer; write to me. I repeat, I shall need to see you every day, and to receive from you guarantees of loyalty, of discretion which, for that matter, you do appear, I must say, to furnish. But in the course of my life I have been so often taken in by appearances that I never wish to trust them again. Damn it, it�s the least you can expect that before giving up a treasure I should know into what hands it is going to pass. Very well, bear in mind what I�m offering you; you are like Hercules� (though, unfortunately for yourself, you do not appear to me to have quite his muscular development) at the parting of the ways. Try not to have to regret all your life not having chosen the way that leads to virtue. Hallo!� he turned to the cabman, �haven�t you put the hood down? I�ll do it myself. I think, too, I�d better drive, seeing the state you appear to be in.�  ���He jumped in beside the cabman, took the reins, and the horse trotted off.  ���As for myself, no sooner had I turned in at our gate than I found the pendant to the conversation which I had heard exchanged that afternoon between Bloch and M. de Norpois, but in another form, brief, inverted and cruel. This was a dispute between our butler, who believed in Dreyfus, and the Guermantes�, who was an anti-Dreyfusard. The truths and counter-truths which came in conflict above ground, among the intellectuals of the rival Leagues, the Patrie Fran�aise and the Droits de l�Homme, were fast spreading downwards into the subsoil of popular opinion. M. Reinach was manipulating, by appeals to sentiment, people whom he had never seen, while for himself the Dreyfus case simply presented itself to his reason as an incontrovertible theory which he proved in the sequel by the most astonishing victory for rational policy (a victory against France, according to some) that the world has ever seen. In two years he replaced a Billot by a Clemenceau Ministry, revolutionised public opinion from top to bottom, took Picquart from his prison to install him, ungrateful, in the Ministry of War. Perhaps this rationalist manipulator of crowds was himself the puppet of his ancestry. When we find that the systems of philosophy which contain the most truths were dictated to their authors, in the last analysis, by reasons of sentiment, how are we to suppose that in a simple affair of politics like the Dreyfus case reasons of this order may not, unknown to the reasoner, have controlled his reason. Bloch believed himself to have been led by a logical sequence to choose Dreyfusism, yet he knew that his nose, skin and hair had been imposed on him by his race. Doubtless the reason enjoys more freedom; yet it obeys certain laws which it has not prescribed for itself. The case of the Guermantes� butler and our own was peculiar. The waves of the two currents of Dreyfusism and anti-Dreyfusism which now divided France from end to end were, on the whole, silent, but the occasional echoes which they emitted were sincere. When you heard anyone in the middle of a conversation which was being deliberately kept off the Case announce furtively some piece of political news, generally false, but always with a hopefulness of its truth, you could induce from the nature of his predictions where his heart lay. Thus there came into conflict on certain points, on one side a timid apostolate, on the other a righteous indignation. The two butlers whom I heard arguing as I came in furnished an exception to the rule. Ours let it be understood that Dreyfus was guilty, the Guermantes� butler that he was innocent. This was done not to conceal their personal convictions, but from cunning, and in the keenness of their rivalry. Our butler, being uncertain whether the fresh trial would be ordered, wished beforehand, in the event of failure, to deprive the Duke�s butler of the joy of seeing a just cause vanquished. The Duke�s butler thought that, in the event of a refusal, ours would be more indignant at the detention on the Devil�s Isle of an innocent man. The porter looked on. I had the impression that it was not he who was the cause of dissension in the Guermantes household.  ���I went upstairs, and found my grandmother not so well. For some time past, without knowing exactly what was wrong, she had been complaining of her health. It is in moments of illness that we are compelled to recognise that we live not alone but chained to a creature of a different kingdom, whole worlds apart, who has no knowledge of us and by whom it is impossible to make ourselves understood: our body. Say that we met a brigand by the way; we might yet convince him by an appeal to his personal interest, if not to our own plight. But to ask pity of our body is like discoursing before an octopus, for which our words can have no more meaning than the sound of the tides, and with which we should be appalled to find ourselves condemned to live. My grandmother�s attacks passed, often enough-unnoticed by the attention which she kept always diverted to ourselves. When the pain was severe, in the hope of curing it, she would try in vain to understand what the trouble was. If the morbid phenomena of which her body was the theatre remained obscure and beyond the reach of her mind, they were clear and intelligible to certain creatures belonging to the same natural kingdom as themselves, creatures to which the human mind has learned gradually to have recourse in order to understand what the body is saying to it, as when a foreigner accosts us we try to find some one belonging to his country who will act as interpreter. These can talk to our body, and tell us if its anger is serious or will soon be appeased. Cottard, whom we had called in to see my grandmother, and who had infuriated us by asking with a dry smile, the moment we told him that she was ill: �Ill? You�re sure it�s not what they call a diplomatic illness?� He tried to soothe his patient�s restlessness by a milk diet. But incessant bowls of milk soup gave her no relief, because my grandmother sprinkled them liberally with salt (the toxic effects of which were as yet, Widal not having made his discoveries, unknown). For, medicine being a compendium of the successive and contradictory mistakes of medical practioners, when we summon the wisest of them to our aid, the chances are that we may be relying on a scientific truth the error of which will be recognised in a few years� time. So that to believe in medicine would be the height of folly, if not to believe in it were not greater folly still, for from this mass of errors there have emerged in the course of time many truths. Cottard had told us to take her temperature. A thermometer was fetched. Throughout almost all its length it was clear of mercury. Scarcely could one make out, crouching at the foot of the tube, in its little cell, the silver salamander. It seemed dead. The glass reed was slipped into my grandmother�s mouth. We had no need to leave it there for long; the little sorceress had not been slow in casting her horoscope. We found her motionless, perched half-way up her tower, and declining to move, shewing us with precision the figure that we had asked of her, a figure with which all the most careful examination that my grandmother�s mind could have devoted to herself would have been incapable of furnishing her: 101 degrees. For the first time we felt some anxiety. We shook the thermometer well, to erase the ominous line, as though we were able thus to reduce the patient�s fever simultaneously with the figure shewn on the scale. Alas, it was only too clear that the little sibyl, unreasoning as she was, had not pronounced judgment arbitrarily, for the next day, scarcely had the thermometer been inserted between my grandmother�s lips when almost at once, as though with a single bound, exulting in her certainty and in her intuition of a fact that to us was imperceptible, the little prophetess had come to a halt at the same point, in an implacable immobility, and pointed once again to that figure 101 with the tip of her gleaming wand. Nothing more did she tell us; in vain might we long, seek, pray, she was deaf to our entreaties; it seemed as though this were her final utterance, a warning and a menace. Then, in an attempt to constrain her to modify her response, we had recourse to another creature of the same kingdom, but more potent, which is not content with questioning the body but can command it, a febrifuge of the same order as the modern aspirin, which had not then come into use. We had not shaken the thermometer down below 99.5, and hoped that it would not have to rise from there. We made my grandmother swallow this drug and then replaced the thermometer in her mouth. Like an implacable warder to whom one presents a permit signed by a higher authority whose protecting influence one has sought and who, finding it to be in order, replies: �Very well; I have nothing to say; if it�s like that you may pass,� this time the watcher in the tower dirt not move. But sullenly she seemed to be saying: �What use will that be to you? Since you are friends with quinine, she may give me the order not to go up, once, ten times, twenty times. And then she will grow tired of telling me, I know her; get along with you. This won�t last for ever. And then you�ll be a lot better off.� Thereupon my grandmother felt the presence within her of a creature which knew the human body better than herself, the presence of a contemporary of the races that have vanished from the earth, the presence of earth�s first inhabitant � long anterior to the creation of thinking man � she felt that aeonial ally who was sounding her, a little roughly even, in the head, the heart, the elbow; he found out the weak places, organised everything for the prehistoric combat which began at once to be fought. In a moment a trampled Python, the fever, was vanquished by the potent chemical substance to which my grandmother, across the series of kingdoms, reaching out beyond all animal and vegetable life, would fain have been able to give thanks. And she remained moved by this glimpse which she had caught, through the mists of so many centuries, of a climate anterior to the creation even of plants. Meanwhile the thermometer, like a Weird Sister momentarily vanquished by some more ancient god, held motionless her silver spindle. Alas! other inferior creatures which man has trained to the chase of the mysterious quarry which he cannot pursue within the pathless forest of himself, reported cruelly to us every day a certain quantity of albumen, not large, but constant enough for it also to appear to bear relation to some persistent malady which we could not detect. Bergotte had shocked that scrupulous instinct in me which made me subordinate my intellect when he spoke to me of Dr. du Boulbon as of a physician who would not bore me, who would discover methods of treatment which, however strange they might appear, would adapt themselves to the singularity of my mind. But ideas transform themselves in us, they overcome the resistance with which we at first meet them, and feed upon rich intellectual reserves which we did not know to have been prepared for them. So, as happens whenever anything we have heard said about some one whom we do not know has had the faculty of awakening in us the idea of great talent, of a sort of genius, in my inmost mind I gave Dr. du Boulbon the benefit of that unlimited confidence which he inspires in us who with an eye more penetrating than other men�s perceives the truth. I knew indeed that he was more of a specialist in nervous diseases, the man to whom Charcot before his death had predicted that he would reign supreme in neurology and psychiatry. �Ah! I don�t know about that. It�s quite possible,� put in Fran�oise, who was in the room and heard Charcot�s name, as she heard du Boulbon�s, for the first time But this in no way prevented her from saying �It�s possible.� Her �possibles,� her �perhapses,� her �I don�t knows� were peculiarly irritating at such a moment. One wanted to say to her: �Naturally you don�t know, since you haven�t the faintest idea of what we are talking about, how can you even say whether it�s possible or not; you know nothing about it. Anyhow, you can�t say now that you don�t know what Charcot said to du Boulbon. You do know because we have just told you, and your �perhapses� and �possibles� don�t come in, because it�s a fact.�  ���In spite of this more special competence in cerebral and nervous matters, as I knew that du Boulbon was a great physician, a superior man, of a profound and inventive intellect, I begged my mother to send for him, and the hope that, by a clear perception of the malady, he might perhaps cure it, carried the day finally over the fear that we had of (if we called in a specialist) alarming my grandmother. What decided my mother was the fact that, encouraged unconsciously by Cottard, my grandmother no longer went out of doors, and scarcely rose from her bed. In vain might she answer us in the words of Mme. de S�vign�s letter on Mme. de la Fayette: �Everyone said she was mad not to wish to go out. I said to these persons, so headstrong in their judgment: �Mme. de la Fayette is not mad!� and I stuck to that. It has taken her death to prove that she was quite right not to go out.� Du Boulbon when he came decided against � if not Mme. de S�vign�, whom we did not quote to him � my grandmother, at any rate. Instead of sounding her chest, fixing on her steadily his wonderful eyes, in which there was perhaps the illusion that he was making a profound scrutiny of his patient, or the desire to give her that illusion, which seemed spontaneous but must be mechanically produced, or else not to let her see that he was thinking of something quite different, or simply to obtain the mastery over her, he began talking about Bergotte.  ��� �I should think so, indeed, he�s magnificent, you are quite right to admire him. But which of his books do you prefer? Indeed! Well, perhaps that is the best after all. In any case it is the best composed of his novels. Claire is quite charming in it; of his male characters which appeals to you most?�  ���I supposed at first that he was making her talk like this about literature because he himself found medicine boring, perhaps also to display his breadth of mind and even, with a more therapeutic aim, to restore confidence to his patient, to shew her that he was not alarmed, to take her mind from the state of her health. But afterwards I realised that, being distinguished particularly as an alienist and by his work on the brain, he had been seeking to ascertain by these questions whether my grandmother�s memory was in good order. As though reluctantly he began to inquire about her past life, fixing a stern and sombre eye on her. Then suddenly, as though catching sight of the truth and determined to reach it at all costs, with a preliminary rubbing of his hands, which he seemed to have some difficulty in wiping dry of the final hesitations which he himself might feel and of all the objections which we might have raised, looking down at my grandmother with a lucid eye, boldly and as though he were at last upon solid ground, punctuating his words in a quiet, impressive tone, every inflexion of which bore the mark of intellect, he began. (His voice, for that matter, throughout this visit remained what it naturally was, caressing. And under his bushy brows his ironical eyes were full of kindness.)  ��� �You will be quite well, Madame, on the day � when it comes, and it rests entirely with you whether it comes to-day � on which you realise that there is nothing wrong with you, and resume your ordinary life. You tell me that you have not been taking your food, not going out?�  ��� �But, Sir, I have a temperature.�  ���He laid a finger on her wrist.  ��� �Not just now, at any rate. Besides, what an excuse! Don�t you know that we keep out in the open air and overfeed tuberculous patients with temperatures of 102?�  ��� �But I have a little albumen as well.�  ��� �You ought not to know anything about that. You have what I have had occasion to call �mental albumen.� We have all of us had, when we have not been very well, little albuminous phases which our doctor has done his best to make permanent by calling our attention to them. For one disorder that doctors cure with drugs (as I am told that they do occasionally succeed in doing) they produce a dozen others in healthy subjects by inoculating them with that pathogenic agent a thousand times more virulent than all the microbes in the world, the idea that one is ill. A belief of that sort, which has a disturbing effect on any temperament, acts with special force on neurotic people. Tell them that a shut window is open behind their back, they will begin to sneeze; make them believe that you have put magnesia in their soup, they will be seized with colic; that their coffee is stronger than usual, they will not sleep a wink all night. Do you imagine, Madame, that I needed to do any more than look into your eyes, listen to the way in which you express yourself, look, if I may say so, at this lady, your daughter, and at your grandson, who takes so much after you, to learn what was the matter with you?� �Your grandmother might perhaps go and sit, if the Doctor allows it, in some quiet path in the Champs-Elys�es, near that laurel shrubbery where you used to play when you were little,� said my mother to me, thus indirectly consulting Dr. du Boulbon, her voice for that reason assuming a tone of timid deference which it would not have had if she had been addressing me alone. The Doctor turned to my grandmother and, being apparently as well-read in literature as in science, adjured her as follows: �Go to the Champs-Elys�es, Madame, to the laurel shrubbery which your grandson loves. The laurel you will find health-giving. It purifies. After he had exterminated the serpent Python, it was with a bough of laurel in his hand that Apollo made his entry into Delphi. He sought thus to guard himself from the deadly germs of the venomous monster. So you see that the laurel is the most ancient, the most venerable and, I will add � what is of therapeutic as well as of prophylactic value � the most beautiful of antiseptics.�  ���In as much as a great part of what doctors know is taught them by the sick, they are easily led to believe that this knowledge which patients exhibit is common to them all, and they pride themselves on taking the patient of the moment by surprise with some remark picked up at a previous bedside. Thus it was with the superior smile of a Parisian who, in conversation with a peasant, might hope to surprise him by using suddenly a word of the local dialect that Dr. du Boulbon said to my grandmother: �Probably a windy night will make you sleep when the strongest soporifics would have no effect.� �On the contrary, Sir, when the wind blows I can never sleep at all.� But doctors are touchy people. �Ach!� muttered du Boulbon, knitting his brows, as if some one had trodden on his toe, or as if my grandmother�s sleeplessness on stormy nights were a personal insult to himself. He had not, however, an undue opinion of himself, and since, in his character as a �superior� person, he felt himself bound not to put any faith in medicine, he quickly recovered his philosophic serenity.  ���My mother, in her passionate longing for reassurance from Bergotte�S friend, added in support of his verdict that a first cousin of my grandmother, who suffered from a nervous complaint, had lain for seven years cloistered in her bedroom at Combray, without leaving her bed more than once or twice a week.  ��� �You see, Madame, I didn�t know that, and yet I could have told you.�  ��� �But, Sir, I am not in the least like her; on the contrary, my doctor complains that he cannot get me to stay in bed,� said my grandmother, whether because she was a little annoyed by the doctor�s theories, or was anxious to submit to him any objections that might be raised to them, in the hope that he would refute these and that, after he had gone, she would no longer find any doubt lurking in her own mind as to the accuracy of his encouraging diagnosis.  ��� �Why, naturally, Madame, you cannot have all the forms of � if you�ll excuse my saying so � mania at once; you have others, but not that particular one. Yesterday I visited a home for neurasthenics. In the garden, I saw a man standing on a seat, motionless as a fakir, his neck bent in a position which must have been highly uncomfortable. On my asking him what he was doing there, he replied, without turning his head, or moving a muscle: �You see, Doctor, I am extremely rheumatic and catch cold very easily; I have just been taking a lot of exercise, and while I was getting hot, like a fool, my neck was touching my flannels. If I move it away from my flannels now before letting myself cool down, I am certain to get a stiff neck, and possibly bronchitis.� Which he would, in fact, have done. �You�re a fine specimen of neurasthenia, that�s what you are,� I told him. And do you know what argument he advanced to prove that I was mistaken? It was this; that while all the other patients in the place had a mania for testing their weight, so much so that the weighing machine had to be padlocked so that they should not spend the whole day on it, he had to be lifted on to it bodily, so little did he care to be weighed. He prided himself on not sharing the mania of the others without thinking that he had also one of his own, and that it was this which saved him from the other. You must not be offended by the comparison, Madame, for the man who dared not turn his neck for fear of catching a chill is the greatest poet of our day. That poor maniac is the most lofty intellect that I know. Submit to being called a neurotic. You belong to that splendid and pitiable family which is the salt of the earth. All the greatest things We know have come to us from neurotics. It is they and they only who have founded religions and created great works of art. Never will the world be conscious of how much it owes to them, nor above all of what they have suffered in order to bestow their gifts on it. We enjoy fine music, beautiful pictures, a thousand exquisite things, but we do not know what they cost those who wrought them in sleeplessness, tears, spasmodic laughter, rashes, asthma, epilepsy a terror of death which is worse than any of these, and which you perhaps have felt, Madame,� he added with a smile at my grandmother, �for confess now, when I came into the room, you were not feeling very confident You thought that you were ill; dangerously ill, perhaps. Heaven only knows what the disease was of which you thought you had detected the symptoms. And you were not mistaken; they were there. Neurosis has an absolute genius for malingering. There is no illness which it cannot counterfeit perfectly. It will produce life-like imitations of the dilatations of dyspepsia, the sicknesses of pregnancy, the broken rhythm of the cardiac, the feverishness of the consumptive. If it is capable of deceiving the doctor how should it fail to deceive the patient? No, no; you mustn�t think I�m making fun of your sufferings. I should not undertake to heal them unless I understood them thoroughly. And, well, they say there�s no good confession unless it�s mutual. I have told you that without nervous trouble there can be no great artist. What is more,� he added, raising a solemn forefinger, �there can be no great scientist either. I will go further, and say that, unless he himself is subject to nervous trouble, he is not, I won�t say a good doctor, but I do say the right doctor to treat nervous troubles. In nervous pathology a doctor who doesn�t say too many foolish things is a patient half-cured, just as a critic is a poet who has stopped writing verse and a policeman a burglar who has retired from practice. I, Madame, I do not, like you, fancy myself to be suffering from albuminuria, I have not your nervous fear of food, nor of fresh air, but I can never go to sleep without getting out of bed at least twenty times to see if my door is shut. And in that home where I found the poet yesterday who would not move his neck, I had gone to secure a room, for � this is between ourselves � I spend my holidays there looking after myself when I have increased my own trouble by wearing myself out in the attempt to cure other people.�  ��� �But do you want me to take a cure like that, Sir?� came to a frightened voice from my grandmother.  ��� �It is not necessary, Madame. The symptoms which you describe will vanish at my bidding. Besides, you have with you a very efficient person whom I appoint as your doctor from now onwards. That is your trouble itself, the super-activity of your nerves. Even if I knew how to cure you of that, I should take good care not to. All I need do is to control it. I see on your table there one of Bergotte�s books. Cured of your neurosis you would no longer care for it. Well, I might feel it my duty to substitute for the joys that it procures for you a nervous stability which would be quite incapable of giving you those joys. But those joys themselves are a strong remedy, the strongest of all perhaps. No; I have nothing to say against your nervous energy. All I ask is that it should listen to me; I leave you in its charge. It must reverse its engines. The force which it is now using to prevent you from getting up, from taking sufficient food, let it employ in making you eat, in making you read, in making you go out, and in distracting you in every possible way. You needn�t tell me that you are fatigued. Fatigue is the organic realisation of a preconceived idea. Begin by not thinking it. And if ever you have a slight indisposition, which is a thing that may happen to anyone, it will be just as if you hadn�t it, for your nervous energy will have endowed you with what M. de Talleyrand, in an expression full of meaning, called �imaginary health.� See, it has begun to cure you already, you have been sitting up in bed listening to me without once leaning back on your pillows; your eye is bright, your complexion is good, I have been talking to you for half an hour by the clock and you have never noticed the time. Well, Madame, I shall now bid you good-day.�  ���When, after seeing Dr. du Boulbon to the door, I returned to the room in which my mother was by herself, the oppression that had been weighing on me for the last few weeks lifted, I felt that my mother was going to break out with a cry of joy and would see my joy, I felt that inability to endure the suspense of the coming moment at which a person is going to be overcome with emotion in our presence, which in another category is a little like the thrill of fear that goes through one when one knows that somebody is going to come in and startle one by a door that is still closed; I tried to speak to Mamma but my voice broke, and, bursting into tears, I stayed for a long time, my head on her shoulder, crying, tasting, accepting, relishing my grief, now that I knew that it had departed from my life, as we like to exalt ourselves by forming virtuous plans which circumstances do not permit us to put into execution. Fran�oise annoyed me by her refusal to share in our joy. She was quite overcome because there had just been a terrible scene between the lovesick footman and the tale-bearing porter. It had required the Duchess herself, in her unfailing benevolence, to intervene, restore an apparent calm to the household and forgive the footman. For she was a good mistress, and that would have been the ideal �place� if only she didn�t listen to �stories.�  ���During the last few days people had begun to hear of my grandmother�s illness and to inquire for news of her. Saint-Loup had written to me: �I do not wish to take advantage of a time when your dear grandmother is unwell to convey to you what is far more than mere reproaches, on a matter with which she has no concern. But I should not be speaking the truth were I to say to you, even out of politeness, that I shall ever forget the perfidy of your conduct, or that there can ever be any forgiveness for so scoundrelly a betrayal.� But some other friends, supposing that my grandmother was not seriously ill (they may not even have known that she was ill at all), had asked me to meet them next day in the Champs-Elys�es, to go with them from there to pay a call together, ending up with a dinner in the country, the thought of which appealed to me. I had no longer any reason to forego these two pleasures. When my grandmother had been told that it was now imperative, if she was to obey Dr. du Boulbon�s orders, that she should go out as much as possible, she had herself at once suggested the Champs-Elys�es. It would be easy for me to escort her there; and, while she sat reading, to arrange with my friends where I should meet them later; and I should still be in time, if I made haste, to take the train with them to Ville d�Avray. When the time came, my grandmother did not want to go out; she felt tired. But my mother, acting on du Boulbon�s instructions, had the strength of mind to be firm and to insist on obedience. She was almost in tears at the thought that my grandmother was going to relapse again into her nervous weakness, which she might never be able to shake off. Never again would there be such a fine, warm day for an outing. The sun as it moved through the sky interspersed here and there in the broken solidity of the balcony its unsubstantial muslins, and gave to the freestone ledge a warm epidermis, an indefinite halo of gold. As Fran�oise had not had time to send a �tube� to her daughter, she left us immediately after luncheon. She very kindly consented, however, to call first at Jupien�s, to get a stitch put in the cloak which my grandmother was going to wear. Returning at that moment from my morning walk I accompanied her into the shop. �Is it your young master who brings you here,� Jupien asked Fran�oise, �is it you who are bringing him to see me or is it some good wind and fortune that bring you both?� For all his want of education, Jupien respected the laws of grammar as instinctively as M. de Guermantes, in spite of every effort, broke them. With Fran�oise gone and the cloak mended, it was time for my grandmother to get ready. Having obstinately refused to let Mamma stay in the room with her, she took, left to herself, an endless time over her dressing, and now that I knew her to be quite well, with that strange indifference which we feel towards our relatives so long as they are alive, which makes us put everyone else before them, I felt it to be very selfish of her to take so long, to risk making me late when she knew that I had an appointment with my friends and was dining at Ville d�Avray. In my impatience I finally went downstairs without waiting for her, after I had twice been told that she was just ready. At last she joined me, without apologising to me, as she generally did, for having kept me waiting, flushed and bothered like a person who has come to a place in a hurry and has forgotten half her belongings, just as I was reaching the half-opened glass door which, without warming them with it in the least, let in the liquid, throbbing, tepid air from the street (as though the sluices of a reservoir had been opened) between the frigid walls of the passage.  ��� �Oh, dear, if you�re going to meet your friends I ought to have put on another cloak. I look rather poverty-stricken in this one.�  ���I was startled to see her so flushed, and supposed that having begun by making herself late she had had to hurry over her dressing. When we left the cab at the end of the Avenue Gabriel, in the Champs-Elys�es, I saw my grandmother, without a word to me, turn aside and make her way to the little old pavilion with its green trellis, at the door of which I had once waited for Fran�oise. The same park-keeper who had been standing there then was still talking to Fran�oise�s �Marquise� when, following my grandmother who, doubtless because she was feeling sick, had her hand in front of her mouth, I climbed the steps of that little rustic theatre, erected there among the gardens. At the entrance, as in those circus booths where the clown, dressed for the ring and smothered in flour, stands at the door and takes the money himself for the seats, the �Marquise,� at the receipt of custom, was still there in her place with her huge, uneven face smeared with a coarse plaster and her little bonnet of red flowers and black lace surmounting her auburn wig. But I do not suppose that she recognised me. The park-keeper, abandoning his watch over the greenery, with the colour of which his uniform had been designed to harmonise, was talking to her, on a chair by her side.  ��� �So you�re still here?� he was saying. �You don�t think of retiring?�  ��� �And what have I to retire for, Sir? Will you kindly tell me where I shall be better off than here, where I should live more at my ease, and with every comfort? And then there�s all the coming and going, plenty of distraction; my little Paris, I call it; my customers keep me in touch with everything that�s going on. Just to give you an example, there�s one of them who went out not more than five minutes ago; he�s a magistrate, in the very highest position there is. Very well, Sir,� she cried with ardour, as though prepared to maintain the truth of this assertion by violence, should the agent of civic authority shew any sign of challenging its accuracy, �for the last eight years, do you follow me, every day God has made, regularly on the stroke of three he�s been here, always polite, never saying one word louder than another, never making any mess; and he stays half an hour and more to read his papers and do his little jobs. There was one day he didn�t come. I never noticed it at the time, but that evening, all of a sudden I said to myself: �Why, that gentleman never came to-day; perhaps he�s dead!� And that gave me a regular turn, you know, because, of course, I get quite fond of people when they behave nicely. And so I was very glad when I saw him come in again next day, and I said to him, I did: �I hope there was nothing wrong yesterday, Sir?� Then he told me that it was his wife that had died, and he�d been so put out, poor gentleman, what with one thing and another, he hadn�t been able to come. He had that really sad look, you know, people have when they�ve been married five-and-twenty years, and then the parting, but he seemed pleased, all the same, to be back here. You could see that all his little habits had been quite upset. I did what I could to make him feel at home. I said to him: �Y� mustn�t let go of things, Sir. Just come here the same as before, it will be a little distraction for you in your sorrow.��  ���The �Marquise� resumed a gentler tone, for she had observed that the guardian of groves and lawns was listening to her complacently and with no thought of contradiction, keeping harmlessly in its scabbard a sword which looked more like a horticultural implement or some symbol of a garden-god.  ��� �And besides,� she went on, �I choose my customers, I don�t let everyone into my little parlours, as I call them. And doesn�t the place just look like a parlour with all my flowers? Such friendly customers I have; there�s always some one or other brings me a spray of nice lilac, or jessamine or roses; my favourite flowers, roses are.�  ���The thought that we were perhaps despised by this lady because we never brought any sprays of lilac or fine roses to her bower made me redden, and in the hope of making a bodily escape � or of being condemned only by default � from an adverse judgment, I moved towards the exit. But it is not always in this world the people who bring us fine roses to whom we are most friendly, for the �Marquise,� thinking that I was bored, turned to me.  ��� �You wouldn�t like me to open a little place for you?�  ���And, on my declining:  ��� �No? You�re sure you won�t?� she persisted, smiling. �Well, just as you please. You�re welcome to it, but I know quite well, not having to pay for a thing won�t make you want to do it if you don�t want to.�  ���At this moment a shabbily dressed woman hurried into the place who seemed to be feeling precisely the want in question. But she did not belong to the �Marquise�s� world, for the latter, with the ferocity of a snob, flung at her:  ��� �I�ve nothing disengaged, Ma�am.�  ��� �Will they be long?� asked the poor lady, reddening beneath the yellow flowers in her hat.  ��� �Well, Ma�am, if you�ll take my advice, you�ll try somewhere else; you see, there are still these two gentlemen waiting, and I�ve only one closet; the others are out of order.�  ��� �Not much money there,� she explained when the other had gone. �It�s not the sort we want here, either; they�re not clean, don�t treat the place with respect, it would be your humble here that would have to spend the next hour cleaning up after her ladyship. I�m not sorry to lose her penny.�  ���Finally my grandmother emerged, and feeling that she probably would not seek to atone by a lavish gratuity for the indiscretion that she had shewn by remaining so long inside, I beat a retreat, so as not to have to share in the scorn which the �Marquise� would no doubt heap on her, and began strolling along a path, but slowly, so that my grandmother should not have to hurry to overtake me; as presently she did. I expected her to begin: �I am afraid I�ve kept you waiting; I hope you�ll still be in time for your friends,� but she did not utter a single word, so much so that, feeling a little hurt, I was disinclined to speak first; until looking up at her I noticed that as she walked beside me she kept her face turned the other way. I was afraid that her heart might be troubling her again. I studied her more carefully and was struck by the disjointedness of her gait. Her hat was crooked, her cloak stained; she had the confused and worried look, the flushed, slightly dazed face of a person who has just been knocked down by a carriage or pulled out of a ditch.  ��� �I was afraid you were feeling sick, Grandmamma; are you feeling better now?� I asked her.  ���Probably she thought that it would be impossible for her, without alarming me, not to make some answer.  ��� �I heard the whole of her conversation with the keeper,� she told me. �Could anything have been more typical of the Guermantes, or the Verdurins and their little circle? Heavens, what fine language she put it all in!� And she quoted, with deliberate application, this sentence from her own special Marquise, Mme. de S�vign�: �As I listened to them I thought that they were preparing for me the pleasures of a farewell.�  ���Such was the speech that she made me, a speech into which she had put all her critical delicacy, her love of quotations, her memory of the classics more thoroughly even than she would naturally have done, and as though to prove that she retained possession of all these faculties. But I guessed rather than heard what she said, so inaudible was the voice in which she muttered her sentences, clenching her teeth more than could be accounted for by the fear of being sick again.  ��� �Come!� I said lightly, so as not to seem to be taking her illness too seriously, �since your heart is bothering you, shall we go home now? I don�t want to trundle a grandmother with indigestion about the Champs-Elys�es.�  ��� �I didn�t like to suggest it, because of your friends,� she replied. �Poor boy! But if you don�t mind, I think it would be wiser.�  ���I was afraid of her noticing the strange way in which she uttered these words.  ��� �Come!� I said to her sharply, �you mustn�t tire yourself talking; if your heart is bad, it�s silly; wait till we get home.�  ���She smiled at me sorrowfully and gripped my hand. She had realised that there was no need to hide from me what I had at once guessed, that she had had a slight stroke.  ���We made our way back along the Avenue Gabriel, through the strolling crowd. I left my grandmother to rest on a seat and went in search of a cab. She, in whose heart I always placed myself when I had to form an opinion of the most unimportant person, she was now closed to me, had become part of the world outside, and, more than from any casual passerby, I was obliged to keep from her what I thought of her condition, to say no word of my uneasiness. I could not have spoken of it to her in greater confidence than to a stranger. She had suddenly handed back to me the thoughts, the griefs which, from the days of my infancy, I had entrusted for all time to her keeping. She was not yet dead. I was already alone. And even those allusions which she had made to the Guermantes, to Mme. de S�vign�, to our conversations about the little clan, assumed an air of being without point or occasion, fantastic, because they sprang from the nullity of this very being who to-morrow possibly would have ceased to exist, for whom they would no longer have any meaning, from that nullity, incapable of conceiving them, which my grandmother would shortly be.  ��� �Well, Sir, I don�t like to say no, but you have not made an appointment, you have no time fixed. Besides, this is not my day for seeing patients. You surely have a doctor of your own. I cannot interfere with his practice, unless he were to call me in for a consultation. It�s a question of professional etiquette . . . �  ���Just as I was signalling to a cabman, I had caught sight of the famous Professor E� � almost a friend of my father and grandfather, acquainted at any rate with them both, who lived in the Avenue Gabriel, and, with a sudden inspiration, had stopped him just as he was entering his house, thinking that he would perhaps be the very person to advise my grandmother. But he was evidently in a hurry and, after calling for his letters, seemed anxious to get rid of me, so that my only chance of speaking to him lay in going up with him in the lift, of which he begged me to allow him to work the switches himself, this being a mania with him.  ��� �But, Sir, I am not asking you to see my grandmother here; you will realise from what I am trying to tell you that she is not in a fit state to come; what I am asking is that you should call at our house in half an hour�s time, when I have taken her home.�  ��� �Call at your house! Really, Sir, you must not expect me to do that. I am dining with the Minister of Commerce. I have a call to pay first. I must change at once, and to make matters worse I have torn my coat and my� other one has no buttonholes for my. decorations. I beg you, please, to oblige me by not touching the switches. You don�t know how the lift works; one can�t be too careful. Getting that buttonhole made means more delay. Well, as I am a friend of your people, if your grandmother comes here at once I will see her. But I warn you that I shall be able to give her exactly a quarter of an hour, nor a moment more.�  ���I had started off at once, without even getting out of the lift which Professor E��-had himself set in motion to take me down again, casting a suspicious glance at me as he did so.  ���We may, indeed, say that the hour of death is uncertain, but when we say so we represent that hour to ourselves as situated in a vague and remote expanse of time, it never occurs to us that it can have any connexion with the day that has already dawned, or may signify that death � or its first assault and partial possession of us, after which it will never leave hold of us again � may occur this very afternoon, so far from uncertain, this afternoon every hour of which has already been allotted to some occupation. You make a point of taking your drive every day so that in a month�s time you will have had the full benefit of the fresh air; you have hesitated over which cloak you will take, which cabman to call, you are in the cab, the whole day lies before you, short because you have to be at home early, as a friend is coming to see you; you hope that it will be as fine again to-morrow; and you have no suspicion that death, which has been making its way towards you along another plane, shrouded in an impenetrable darkness, has chosen precisely this day of all days to make its appearance, in a few minutes� time, more or less, at the moment when the carriage has reached the Champs-Elys�es. Perhaps those who are haunted as a rule by the fear of the utter strangeness of death will find something reassuring in this kind of death � in this kind of first contact with death � because death thus assumes a known, familiar guise of everyday life. A good luncheon has preceded it, and the same outing that people take who are in perfect health. A drive home in an open carriage comes on top of its first onslaught; ill as my grandmother was, there were, after all, several people who could testify that at six o�clock, as we came home from the Champs-Elys�es, they had bowed to her as she drove past in an open carriage, in perfect weather. Legrandin, making his way towards the Place de la Concorde, raised his hat to us, stopping to look after us with an air of surprise. I, who was not yet detached from life, asked my grandmother if she had acknowledged his greeting, reminding her of his readiness to take offence. My grandmother, thinking me no doubt very frivolous, raised her hand in the air as though to say: �What does it matter? It is not of the least importance.�  ���Yes, one might have said that, a few minutes earlier, when I was looking for a cab, my grandmother was resting on a seat in the Avenue Gabriel, and that a little later she had driven past in an open carriage. But would that have been really true? The seat, for instance, to maintain its position at the side of an avenue � for all that it may be subjected also to certain conditions of equilibrium � has no need of energy. But in order that a living person may be stable, even when supported by a seat or in a carriage, there is required a tension of forces which we do not ordinarily perceive any more than we perceive (because its action is universal) atmospheric pressure. Possibly if we were to be hollowed out and then left to support the pressure of the air we might feel, in the moment that preceded our extinction, that terrible weight which there was nothing left in us to neutralise. Similarly when the abyss of sickness and death opens within us and we have no longer any resistance to offer to the tumult with which the world and our own body rush upon us, then to endure even the tension of our own muscles, the shudder that freezes us to the marrow, then even to keep ourselves motionless in what we ordinarily regard as nothing but the simple negative position of a lifeless thing requires, if we wish our head to remain erect and our eyes calm, an expense of vital energy and becomes the object of an exhausting struggle.  ���And if Legrandin had looked back at us with that astonished air, it was because to him, as to the other people who passed us then, in the cab in which my grandmother was apparently seated she had seemed to be foundering, sliding into the abyss, clinging desperately to the cushions which could barely arrest the downward plunge of her body, her hair in disorder, her eye wild, unable any longer to face the assault of the images which its pupil was not strong enough now to bear. She had appeared to them, although I was still by her side, submerged in that unknown world somewhere in which she had already received the blows, traces of which she still bore when I looked up at her a few minutes earlier in the Champs-Elys�es, her hat, her face, her cloak left in disorder by the hand of the invisible angel with whom she had wrestled. I have thought, since, that this moment of her stroke cannot have altogether surprised my grandmother, that indeed she had perhaps foreseen it a long time back, had lived in expectation of it. She had not known, naturally, when this fatal moment would come, had never been certain, any more than those lovers whom a similar doubt leads alternately to found unreasonable hopes and unjustified suspicions on the fidelity of their mistresses. But it is rarely that these grave maladies, like that which now at last had struck her full in the face, do not take up their abode in the sick man for a long time before killing him, during which time they make haste, like a �sociable� neighbour or tenant, to introduce themselves to him. A terrible acquaintance, not so much from the sufferings that it causes as from the strange novelty of the definite restriction which it imposes upon life. A woman sees herself dying, in these cases not at the actual moment of death but months, sometimes years before, when death has hideously come to dwell in her. The sufferer makes the acquaintance of the stranger whom she hears coming and going in her brain. She does not know him by sight, it is true, but from the sounds which she hears him regularly make she can form an idea of his habits. Is he a criminal? One morning, she can no longer hear him. He has gone. Ah! If it were only for ever! In the evening he has returned. What are his plans? Her specialist, put to the question, like an adored mistress, replies with avowals that one day are believed, another day fail to convince her. Or rather it is not the mistress�s part but that of the servants one interrogates that the doctor plays. They are only third parties. The person whom we press for an answer, whom we suspect of being about to play us false, is life itself, and although we feel her to be no longer the same we believe in her still or at least remain undecided until the day on which she finally abandons us.  ���I helped my grandmother into Professor E���s lift and a moment later he came to us and took us into his consulting room. But there, busy as he was, his bombastic manner changed, such is the force of habit; for his habit was to be friendly, that is to say lively with his patients. Since he knew that my grandmother was a great reader, and was himself one also, he devoted the first few minutes to quoting various favourite passages of poetry appropriate to the glorious summer weather. He had placed her in an armchair and himself with his back to the light so as to have a good view of her. His examination was minute and thorough, even obliging me at one moment to leave the room. He continued it after my return, then, having finished, went on, although the quarter of an hour was almost at an end, repeating various quotations to my grandmother. He even made a few jokes, which were witty enough, though I should have preferred to hear them on some other occasion, but which completely reassured me by the tone of amusement in which he uttered them. I then remembered that M. Falli�res, the President of the Senate, had, many years earlier, had a false seizure, and that to the consternation of his political rivals he had returned a few days later to his duties and had begun, it was said, his preparations for a more or less remote succession to the Presidency of the Republic. My confidence in my grandmother�s prompt recovery was all the more complete in that, just as I was recalling the example of M. Falli�res, I was distracted from following up the similarity by a shout of laughter, which served as conclusion to one of the Professor�s jokes. After which he took out his watch, wrinkled his brows petulantly on seeing that he was five minutes late, and while he bade us good-bye rang for his other coat to be brought to him at once. I waited until my grandmother had left the room, closed the door and asked him to tell me the truth.  ��� �There is not the slightest hope,� he informed me. �It is a stroke brought on by uraemia. In itself, uraemia is not necessarily fatal, but this case seems to me desperate. I need not tell you that I hope I am mistaken. Anyhow, you have Cottard, you�re in excellent hands. Excuse me,� he broke off as a maid came into the room with his coat over her arm. �I told you, I�m dining with the Minister of Commerce, and I have a call to pay first. Ah! Life is not all a bed of roses, as one is apt to think at your age.�  ���And he graciously offered me his hand. I had shut the door behind me, and a footman was shewing us into the hall when we heard a loud shout of rage. The maid had forgotten to cut and hem the buttonhole for the decorations. This would take another ten minutes. The Professor continued to storm while I stood on the landing gazing at a grandmother for whom there was not the slightest hope. Each of us is indeed alone. We started for home.  ���The sun was sinking, it burnished an interminable wall along which our cab had to pass before reaching the street in which we lived, a wall against which the shadow cast by the setting sun of horse and carriage stood out in black on a ruddy background, like a funeral car on some Pompeian terra-cotta. At length we arrived at the house. I made the invalid sit at the foot of the staircase in the hall, and went up to warn my mother. I told her that my grandmother had come home feeling slightly unwell, after an attack of giddiness. As soon as I began to speak, my mother�s face was convulsed by the paroxysm of a despair which was yet already so resigned that I realised that for many years she had been holding herself quietly in readiness for an uncalendared but final day. She asked me no question; it seemed that, just as malevolence likes to exaggerate the sufferings of other people, so in her devotion she would not admit that her mother was seriously ill, especially with a disease which might affect the brain. Mamma shuddered, her eyes wept without tears, she ran to give orders for the doctor to be fetched at once; but when Fran�oise asked who was ill she could not reply, her voice stuck in her throat. She came running downstairs with me struggling to banish from her face the sob that contracted it. My grandmother was waiting below on the sofa in the hall, but, as soon as she heard us coming, drew herself together, stood up, and waved her hand cheerfully at Mamma. I had partially wrapped her head in a white lace shawl, telling her that it was so that she should not catch cold on the stairs. I had hoped that my mother would not notice the change in her face, the distortion of her mouth; my precaution proved unnecessary; my mother went up to my grandmother, kissed her hand as though it were that of her God, raised her up, carried her to the lift with infinite precautions in which there was, with the fear of hurting her by any clumsy movement, the humility of one who felt herself unworthy to touch the most precious thing, to her, in the world, but never once did she raise her eyes, nor look at the sufferer�s face. Perhaps this was in order that my grandmother might not be saddened by the thought that the sight of her could alarm her daughter. Perhaps from fear of a grief so piercing that she dared not face it. Perhaps from reverence, because she did not feel it permissible to herself, without impiety, to remark the trace of any mental weakening on those venerated features. Perhaps to be better able to preserve intact in her memory the image of the true face of my grandmother, radiant with wisdom and goodness. So they went up side by side, my grandmother half hidden by her shawl, my mother turning away her eyes.  ���Meanwhile there was one person who never took hers from what could be made out of my grandmother�s altered features, at which her daughter dared not look, a person who fastened on them a gaze wondering, indiscreet and of evil omen: this was Fran�oise. Not that she was not sincerely attached to my grandmother (indeed she had been disappointed and almost scandalised by the coldness shewn by Mamma, whom she would have liked to see fling herself weeping into her mother�s arms), but she had a certain tendency always to look at the worse side of things, she had retained from her childhood two peculiarities which would seem to be mutually exclusive, but which when combined strengthened one another: the want of restraint common among people of humble origin who make no attempt to conceal the impression, in other words the painful alarm, aroused in them by the sight of a physical change which it would be in better taste to appear not to notice, and the unfeeling coarseness of the peasant who begins by tearing the wings off dragon-flies until she is allowed to wring the necks of chickens, and lacks that modesty which would make her conceal the interest that she feels in the sight of suffering flesh.  ���When, thanks to the faultless ministrations of Fran�oise, my grandmother had been put to bed, she discovered that she could speak much more easily, the little rupture or obstruction of a blood-vessel which had produced the uraemia having apparently been quite slight. And at once she was anxious not to fail Mamma in her hour of need, to assist her in the most cruel moments through which she had yet had to pass.  ��� �Well, my child,� she began, taking my mother�s hand in one of her own, and keeping the other in front of her lips, so as to account for the slight difficulty which she still found in uttering certain words. �So this is all the pity you shew your mother! You look as if you thought that indigestion was quite a pleasant thing!�  ���Then for the first time my mother�s eyes gazed passionately into those of my grandmother, not wishing to see the rest of her face, and she replied, beginning the list of those false promises which we swear but are unable to fulfil:  ��� �Mamma, you will soon be quite well again, your daughter will see to that.�  ���And embodying all her dearest love, all her determination that her mother should recover, in a kiss to which she entrusted them, and which she followed with her mind, with her whole being until it flowered upon her lips, she bent down to lay it humbly, reverently upon the precious brow. My grandmother complained of a sort of alluvial deposit of bedclothes which kept gathering all the time in the same place, over her left leg, and from which she could never manage to free herself. But she did not realise that she was herself the cause of this (so that day after day she accused Fran�oise unjustly of not �doing� her bed properly). By a convulsive movement she kept flinging to that side the whole flood of those billowing blankets of fine wool, which gathered there like the sand in a bay which is very soon transformed into a beach (unless the inhabitants construct a breakwater) by the successive deposits of the tide.  ���My mother and I (whose falsehood was exposed before we spoke by the obnoxious perspicacity of Fran�oise) would not even admit that my grandmother was seriously ill, as though such an admission might give pleasure to her enemies (not that she had any) and it was more loving to feel that she was not so bad as all that, in short from the same instinctive sentiment which had led me to suppose that Andr�e was too sorry for Al-bertine to be really fond of her. The same individual phenomena are reproduced in the mass, in great crises. In a war, the man who does not love his country says nothing against it, but regards it as lost, commiserates it, sees everything in the darkest colours.  ���Fran�oise was of infinite value to us owing to her faculty of doing without sleep, of performing the most arduous tasks. And if, when she had gone to bed after several nights spent in the sick-room, we were obliged to call her a quarter of an hour after she had fallen asleep, she was so happy to be able to do the most tiring duties as if they had been the simplest things in the world that, so far from looking cross, her face would light up with a satisfaction tinged with modesty. Only when the time came for mass, or for breakfast, then, had my grandmother been in her death agony, still Fran�oise would have quietly slipped away so as not to make herself late. She neither could nor would let her place be taken by her young footman. It was true that she had brought from Combray an extremely exalted idea of everyone�s duty towards ourselves; she would not have tolerated that any of our servants should �fail� us. This doctrine had made her so noble, so imperious, so efficient an instructor that there had never come to our house any servants, however corrupted who had not speedily modified, purified their conception of life so far as to refuse to touch the usual commissions from tradesmen and to come rushing � however little they might previously have sought to oblige � to take from my hands and not let me tire myself by carrying the smallest package. But at Combray Fran�oise had contracted also � and had brought with her to Paris � the habit of not being able to put up with any assistance in her work. The sight of anyone coming to help her seemed to her like receiving a deadly insult, and servants had remained for weeks in the house without receiving from her any response to their morning greeting, had even gone off on their holidays without her bidding them good-bye or their guessing her reason, which was simply and solely that they had offered to do a share of her work on some day when she had not been well. And at this moment when my grandmother was so ill Fran�oise�s duties seemed to her peculiarly her own. She would not allow herself, she, the official incumbent, to be done out of her part in the ritual of these festal days. And so her young footman, sent packing by her, did not know what to do with himself, and not content with having copied the butler�s example and supplied himself with note-paper from my desk had begun as well to borrow volumes of poetry from my bookshelves. He sat reading them for a good half of the day, out of admiration for the poets who had written them, but also so as, during the rest of his time, to begem with quotations the letters which he wrote to his friends in his native village. Naturally he expected these to dazzle them. But as there was little sequence in his ideas he had formed the notion that these poems, picked out at random from my shelves, were matters of common knowledge, to which it was customary to refer. So much so that in writing to these peasants, whose stupefaction he discounted, he interspersed his own reflexions with lines from Lamartine, just as he might have said �Who laughs last, laughs longest!� or merely �How are you keeping?�  ���To ease her pain my grandmother was given morphine. Unfortunately, if this relieved her in other ways, it increased the quantity of albumen. The blows which we aimed at the wicked ogre who had taken up his abode in my grandmother were always wide of the mark, and it was she, her poor interposed body that had to bear them, without her ever uttering more than a faint groan by way of complaint. And the pain that we caused her found no compensation in a benefit which we were unable to give her. The savage ogre whom we were anxious to exterminate we barely succeeded in touching, and all we did was to enrage him still further, and possibly hasten the moment at which he would devour his luckless captive. On certain days when the discharge of albumen had been excessive Cottard, after some hesitation, stopped the morphine. In this man, so insignificant, so common, there was, in these brief moments in which he deliberated, in which the relative dangers of one and another course of treatment presented themselves alternately to his mind until he arrived at a decision, the same sort of greatness as in a general who, vulgar in all the rest of his life, is a great strategist, and in an hour of peril, after a moment�s reflexion, decides upon what is from the military point of view the wisest course, and gives the order: �Advance eastwards.� Medically, however little hope there might be of setting any limit to this attack of uraemia, it did not do to tire the kidneys. But, on the other hand, when my grandmother did not have morphine, her pain became unbearable; she perpetually attempted a certain movement which it was difficult for her to perform without groaning. To a great extent, suffering is a sort of need felt by the organism to make itself familiar with a new state, which makes it uneasy, to adapt its sensibility to that state. We can discern this origin of pain in the case of certain inconveniences which are not such for everyone. Into a room filled with a pungent smoke two men of a coarse fibre will come and attend to their business; a third, more highly strung, will betray an incessant discomfort. His nostrils will continue to sniff anxiously the odour he ought, one would say, to try not to notice but will keep on attempting to attach, by a more exact apprehension of it, to his troubled sense of smell. One consequence of which may well be that his intense preoccupation will prevent him from complaining of a toothache. When my grandmother was in pain the sweat trickled over the pink expanse of her brow, glueing to it her white locks, and if she thought that none of us was in the room she would cry out: �Oh, it�s dreadful!� but if she caught sight of my mother, at once she employed all her energy in banishing from her face every sign of pain, or � an alternative stratagem � repeated the same plaints, accompanying them with explanations which gave a different sense, retrospectively, to those which my mother might have overheard.  ��� �Oh! My dear, it�s dreadful to have to stay in bed on a beautiful sunny day like this when one wants to be out in the air; I am crying with rage at your orders.�  ���But she could not get rid of the look of anguish in her eyes, the sweat on her brow, the convulsive start, checked at once, of her limbs.  ��� �There is nothing wrong. I�m complaining because I�m not lying very comfortably. I feel my hair is untidy, my heart is bad, I knocked myself against the wall.�  ���And my mother, at the foot of the bed, riveted to that suffering form, as though, by dint of piercing with her gaze that pain-bedewed brow, that body which hid the evil thing within it, she could have succeeded in reaching that evil thing and carrying it away, my mother said:  ��� �No, no, Mamma dear, we won�t let you suffer like that, we will find something to take it away, have patience just for a moment; let me give you a kiss, darling � no, you�re not to move.�  ���And stooping over the bed, with bended knees, almost kneeling on the ground, as though by an exercise of humility she would have a better chance of making acceptable the impassioned gift of herself, she lowered towards my grandmother her whole life contained in her face as in a ciborium which she extended over her, adorned in relief with dimples and folds so passionate, so sorrowful, so sweet that one knew not whether they had been carved by the chisel of a kiss, a sob or a smile. My grandmother also, tried to lift up her face to Mamma�s. It was so altered that probably� had she been strong enough to go out, she would have been recognised only by the feather in her hat. Her features, like the clay in a sculptor�s hands seemed to be straining, with an effort which distracted her from everything else, to conform to some particular model which we failed to identify. This business of modelling was now almost finished, and if my grandmother�s face had shrunk in the process it had at the same time hardened. The veins that ran beneath its surface seemed those not of a piece of marble but of some more rugged stone. Constantly thrust forwards by the difficulty that she found in breathing and as constantly forced back on to her pillow by exhaustion, her face, worn, diminished, terribly expressive, seemed like, in a primitive, almost prehistoric carving, the rude, flushed, purplish, desperate face of some savage guardian of a tomb. But the whole task was not yet accomplished. Next, her resistance must be overcome, and that tomb, the entrance to which she had so painfully guarded, with that tense contraction, entered.  ���In one of those moments in which, as the saying goes, one does not know what saint to invoke, as my grandmother was coughing and sneezing a good deal, we took the advice of a relative who assured us that if we sent for the specialist X ��-he would get rid of all that in a couple of days. People say that sort of thing about their own doctors, and their friends believe them just as Fran�oise always believed the advertisements in the newspapers. The specialist came with his bag packed with all the colds and coughs of his other patients, like Aeolus�s bottle. My grandmother refused point-blank to let herself be examined. And we, out of consideration for the doctor, who had had his trouble for nothing, deferred to the desire that he expressed to inspect each of our noses in turn, albeit there was nothing the matter with any of them. According to him, however, there was; everything, whether headache or colic, heart-disease or diabetes, was a disease of the nose that had been wrongly diagnosed. To each of us he said: �I should like to have another look at that little cornea. Don�t put it off too long. I can soon get rid of it for you with a hot needle.� We were, of course, thinking of something quite different. And yet we asked ourselves: �Get rid of what?� In a word, every one of our noses was diseased; his mistake lay only in his use of the present tense. For by the following day his examination and provisional treatment had taken effect. Each of us had his or her catarrh. And when in the street he ran into my father doubled up with a cough, he smiled to think that an ignorant layman might suppose the attack to be due to his intervention. He had examined us at a moment when we were already ill.  ���My grandmother�s illness gave occasion to various people to manifest an excess or deficiency of sympathy which surprised us quite as much as the sort of chance which led one or another of them to reveal to us connecting links of circumstances, or of friendship for that matter, which we had never suspected. And the signs of interest shewn by the people who called incessantly at the house to inquire revealed to us the gravity of an illness which, until then, we had not sufficiently detached from the countless painful impressions that we received in my grandmother�s room. Summoned by telegram, her sisters declined to leave Combray. They had discovered a musician there who gave them excellent chamber concerts, in listening to which they thought that they could find, better than by the invalid�s bedside, food for thought, a melancholy exaltation the form of which was, to say the least of it, unusual. Mme. Sazerat wrote to Mamma, but in the tone of a person whom the sudden breaking off of a betrothal (the cause of the rupture being her Dreyfusism) has parted from one for ever. Bergotte, on the other hand, came every day and spent several hours with me.  ���He had always made a habit of going regularly for some time to the same house, where, accordingly, he need not stand on ceremony. But formerly it had been in order that he might talk without being interrupted; now it was so that he might sit for as long as he chose in silence, without being expected to talk. For he was very ill, some people said with albuminuria, like my grandmother. According to another version, he had a tumour. He grew steadily weaker; it was with difficulty that he came up our staircase, with greater difficulty still that he went down it. Even though he held on to the banisters he often stumbled, and he would, I believe, have stayed at home had he not been afraid of losing altogether the habit of going out, the capacity to go out, he, the �man with the little beard� whom I had seen so alert, not very long since. He was now quite blind and even his speech was frequently obstructed.  ���But at the same time, by a directly opposite process, the body of his work, known only to a few literary people at the period when Mme. Swann used to patronise their timid efforts to disseminate it, now grown in stature and strength before the eyes of all, had acquired an extraordinary power of expansion among the general public. The general rule is, no doubt, that only after his death does a writer become famous. But it was while he still lived, and during his slow progress towards a death that he had not yet reached that this writer was able to watch the progress of his works towards Renown. A dead writer can at least be illustrious without any strain on himself. The effulgence of his name is stopped short by the stone upon his grave. In the deafness of the eternal sleep he is not importuned by Glory. But for Bergotte the antithesis was still incomplete. He existed still sufficiently to suffer from the tumult. He was moving still, though with difficulty, while his books, bounding about him, like daughters whom one loves but whose impetuous youthfulness and noisy pleasures tire one, brought day after day, to his very bedside, a crowd of fresh admirers.  ���The visits which he now began to pay us came for me several years too late, for I had no longer the same admiration for him as of old. Which is not in any sense incompatible with the growth of his reputation. A man�s work seldom becomes completely understood and successful before that of another writer, still obscure, has begun in the minds of certain people more difficult to please to substitute a fresh cult for one that has almost ceased to command observance. In the books of Bergotte which I constantly reread, his sentences stood out as clearly before my eyes as my own thoughts the furniture in my room and the carriages in the street. All the details were quite easily seen, not perhaps precisely as one had always seen them but at any rate as one was accustomed to see them now. But a new writer had recently begun to publish work in which the relations between things were so different from those that connected them for me that I could understand hardly anything of what he wrote. He would say, for instance: �The hose-pipes admired the smart upkeep of the roads� (and so far it was simple, I followed him smoothly along those roads) �which started every five minutes from Briand and Claudel.� At that point I ceased to understand, because I had expected the name of a place and was given that of a person instead. Only I felt that it was not the sentence that was badly constructed but I myself that lacked the strength and ability necessary to reach the end. I would start afresh striving tooth and nail to climb to the pinnacle from which I would see things in their novel relations. And each time, after I had got about halfway through the sentence, I would fall back again, as later on, when I joined the Army, in my attempts at the exercise known as the �bridge-ladder.� I felt nevertheless for the new writer the admiration which an awkward boy who never receives any marks for gymnastics feels when he watches another more nimble. And from then onwards I felt less admiration for Bergotte, whose limpidity began to strike me as insufficient. There was a time at which people recognised things quite easily in pictures when it was Fromentin who had painted them, and could not recognise them at all when it was Renoir.  ���People of taste and refinement tell us nowadays that Renoir is one of the great painters of the last century. But in so saying they forget the element of Time, and that it took a great deal of time, well into the present century, before Renoir was hailed as a great artist. To succeed thus in gaining recognition, the original painter, the original writer proceeds on the lines adopted by oculists. The course of treatment they give us by their painting or by their prose is not always agreeable to us. When it is at an end the operator says to us: �Now look!� And, lo and behold, the world around us (which was not created once and for all, but is created afresh as often as an original artist is born) appears to us entirely different from the; old world, but perfectly clear. Women pass in the street, different from what they used to be, because they are Renoirs, those Renoir types which we persistently refused to see as women. The carriages, too, are Renoirs, and the water, and the sky: we feel tempted to go for a walk in the forest which reminds us of that other which when we first saw it looked like anything in the world except a forest, like for instance a tapestry of innumerable shades but lacking precisely the shades proper to forests. Such is the new and perishable universe which has just been created. It will last until the next geological catastrophe is precipitated by a new painter or writer of original talent.  ���This writer who had taken Bergotte�s place in my affections wearied me not by the incoherence but by the novelty of associations � perfectly coherent � which my mind was not trained to follow. The fact that it was always at the same point that I felt myself relinquish my grasp pointed to a common character in the efforts that I had always to make. Moreover, when once in a thousand times I did succeed in following the writer to the end of his sentence, what I saw there was always of a humour, a truth, a charm similar to those which I had found long ago in reading Bergotte, only more delightful. I reflected that it was not so many years since a similar reconstruction of the world, like that which I was waiting now for his successor to produce, had been wrought for me by Bergotte himself. Until I was led to ask myself whether there was indeed any truth in the distinction which we are always making between art, which is no more advanced now than in Homer�s day, and science with its continuous progress. Perhaps, on the contrary, art was in this respect like science; each new writer seemed to me to have advanced beyond the stage of his immediate predecessor; and how was I to know that in twenty years� time, when I should be able to accompany without strain or effort the newcomer of to-day, another might not appear at whose approach he in turn would be packed off to the limbo to which his own coming would have consigned Bergotte?  ���I spoke to the latter of the new writer. He gave me a distaste for him not so much when he said that his art was uncouth, easy and vacuous, as when he told me that he had seen him, and had almost mistaken him (so strong was the likeness) for Bloch. From that moment my friend�s features outlined themselves on the printed pages, and I no longer felt any obligation to make the effort necessary to understand them. If Bergotte had decried him to me it was less, I fancy, out of jealousy for a success that was yet to come than out of ignorance of his work. He read scarcely anything. The bulk of his thought had long since passed from his brain into his books. He had grown thin, as though they had been extracted from him by surgical operations. His reproductive instinct no longer impelled him to any activity, now that he had given an independent existence to almost all his thoughts. He led the vegetative life of a convalescent, of a woman after childbirth; his fine eyes remained motionless, vaguely dazed, like the eyes of a man who lies on the seashore and in a vague daydream sees only each little breaking wave. However, if it was less interesting to talk to him now than I should once have found it, I felt no compunction for that. He was so far a creature of habit that the simplest habits, like the most elaborate, once he had formed them, became indispensable to him for a certain length of time. I do not know what made him come to our house first of all, but after that every day it was simply because he had been there the day before. He would come to the house as he might have gone to a caf�, so that no one should talk to him, so that he might � very rarely � talk himself; one might in short have found in his conduct a sign that he was moved to sympathise with us in our anxiety, or that he enjoyed my company, had one sought to draw any conclusion from such an assiduity in calling. It did not fail to impress my mother, sensitive to everything that might be regarded as an act of homage to her invalid. And every day she reminded me: �See that you don�t forget to thank him nicely.�  ���We had also � a discreet feminine attention like the refreshments that are brought to us in the studio, between sittings, by a painter�s mistress � a courteous supplement to those which her husband paid us professionally, a visit from Mme. Cottard. She came to offer us her �waiting-woman,� or, if we preferred the services of a man, she would �scour the country� for one, and, best of all, on our declining, said that she did hope this was not just a �put-off on our part, a word which in her world signifies a false pretext for not accepting an invitation. She assured us that the Professor, who never referred to his patients when he was at home, was as sad about it as if it had been she herself who was ill. We shall see in due course that even if this had been true it would have been at once a very small and a considerable admission on the part of the most faithless and the most attentive of husbands.  ���Offers as helpful and infinitely more touching owing to the form in which they were couched (which was a blend of the highest intelligence, the warmest sympathy, and a rare felicity of expression) were addressed to me by the Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg. I had met him at Balbec where he had come on a visit to one of his aunts, the Princesse de Luxembourg, being himself at that time merely Comte de Nassau. He had married, some months later, the charming daughter of another Luxembourg Princess, extremely rich, because she was the only daughter of a Prince who was the proprietor of an immense flour-mill. Whereupon the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, who had no children of his own and was devoted to his nephew Nassau, had obtained the approval of his Chamber to his declaring the young man his heir. As with all marriages of this nature, the origin of the bride�s fortune was the obstacle as it was also the deciding factor. I remembered this Comte de Nassau as one of the most striking young men I had ever met, already devoured, at that time, by a dark and blazing passion for his betrothed. I was deeply touched by the letters which he wrote me, day after day, during my grandmother�s illness, and Mamma herself, in her emotion, quoted sadly one of her mother�s expressions: �S�vign� would not have put it better.�  ���On the sixth day Mamma, yielding to my grandmother�s entreaties, left her for a little and pretended to go and lie down. I should have liked (so that my grandmother might go to sleep) Fran�oise to sit quite still and not disturb her by moving. In spite of my supplications, she got up and left the room; she was genuinely devoted to my grandmother; with her uncanny insight and her natural pessimism she regarded her as doomed. She would therefore have liked to pay her every possible attention. But word had just come that an electrician was in the house, one of the oldest servants of his firm, the head of which was his brother-in-law, highly esteemed throughout the building, where he had worked for many years, and especially by Jupien. This man had been ordered to come before my grandmother�s illness. It seemed to me that he might have been sent away again, or told to wait. But Franchise�s code of manners would not permit of this; it would have been a want of courtesy towards this worthy man; my grandmother�s condition ceased at once to matter. When, after waiting a quarter of an hour, I lost my patience and went to look for her in the kitchen, I found her talking to him on the landing of the back staircase, the door of which stood open, a device which had the advantage, should any of us come on the scene, of letting it be thought that they were just saying goodbye, but had also the drawback of sending a terrible draught through the house. Fran�oise tore herself from the workman, not without turning to shout down after him various greetings, forgotten in her haste, to his wife and brother-in-law. A typical Combray scruple, not to be found wanting in politeness, which Fran�oise extended even to foreign politics. People foolishly imagine that the vast dimensions of social phenomena afford them an excellent opportunity to penetrate farther into the human soul; they ought, on the contrary, to realise that it is by plumbing the depths of a single personality that they might have a chance of understanding those phenomena. A thousand times over Fran�oise told the gardener at Combray that war was the most senseless of crimes, that life was the only thing that mattered. Yet, when the Russo-Japanese war broke out, she was quite ashamed, when she thought of the Tsar, that we had not gone to war also to help the �poor Russians,� �since,� she reminded us, �we�re allianced to them.� She felt this abstention to be not quite polite to Nicholas II, who had always �said such nice things about us�; it was a corollary of the same code which would have prevented her from refusing a glass of brandy from Jupien, knowing that it would �upset� her digestion, and which brought it about that now, with my grandmother lying at death�s door, the same meanness of which she considered France guilty in remaining neutral with regard to Japan she would have had to admit in herself, had she not gone in person to make her apologies to this good electrician who had been put to so much trouble.  ���Luckily for ourselves, we were soon rid of Fran�oise�s daughter, who was obliged to be away for some weeks. To the regular stock of advice which people at Combray gave to the family of an invalid: �You haven�t tried taking him away for a little . . . the change of air, you know . . . pick up an appetite . . . etc?� she had added the almost unique idea, which she had specially created in her own imagination, and repeated accordingly whenever we saw her, without fail, as though hoping by dint of reiteration to force it through the thickness of people�s heads: �She ought to have taken herself in hand radically from the first.� She did not recommend any one cure rather than another, provided that it were �radical.� As for Fran�oise herself, she noticed that we were not giving my grandmother many medicines. Since, according to her, they only destroyed the stomach, she was quite glad of this, but at the same time even more humiliated. She had, in the South of France, some cousins � relatively well-to-do � whose daughter, after falling ill just as she was growing up, had died at twenty-three; for several years the father and mother had ruined themselves on drugs, on different doctors, on pilgrimages from one watering-place to another, until her decease. Now all this seemed to Fran�oise, for the parents in question, a kind of luxury, as though they had owned racehorses, or a Place in the country. They themselves, in the midst of their affliction, derived a certain gratification from the thought of such lavish expenditure. They had now nothing left, least of all their most precious possession, their child, but they did enjoy telling people how they had done as much for her and more than the richest in the land. The ultra-violet rays to the action of which, several times a day for months on end, the poor girl had been subjected, delighted them more than anything. The father, elated in his grief by the glory of it all, was led to speak of his daughter at times as of an operatic star for whose sake he had ruined himself. Fran�oise was not unmoved by this wealth of scenic effect; that which framed my grandmother�s sickbed seemed to her a trifle meagre, suited rather to an illness on the stage of a small provincial theatre.  ���There came a time when her uraemic trouble affected my grandmother�s eyes. For some days she could not see at all. Her eyes were not at all like those of a blind person, but remained just the same as before. And I gathered that she could see nothing only from the strangeness of a certain smile of welcome which she assumed the moment one opened the door, until one had come up to her and taken her hand, a smile which began too soon and remained stereotyped on her lips, fixed, but always full-faced, and endeavouring to be visible from all points, because she could no longer rely upon her sight to regulate it, to indicate the right moment, the proper direction, to bring it to the point, to make it vary according to the change of position or of facial expression of the person who had come in; because it was left isolated, without the accompanying smile in her eyes which would have distracted a little from it the attention of the visitor, it assumed in its awkwardness an undue importance, giving one the impression of an exaggerated friendliness. Then her sight was completely restored; from her eyes the wandering affliction passed to her ears. For several days my grandmother was deaf. And as she was afraid of being taken by surprise by the sudden entry of some one whom she would not have heard come in, all day long, albeit she was lying with her face to the wall, she kept turning her head sharply towards the door. But the movement of her neck was clumsy, for one cannot adapt oneself in a few days to this transposition of faculties, so as, if not actually to see sounds, to listen with one�s eyes. Finally her pain grew less, but the impediment of her speech increased. We were obliged to ask her to repeat almost everything that she said.  ���And now my grandmother, realising that we could no longer understand her, gave up altogether the attempt to speak and lay perfectly still. When she caught sight of me she gave a sort of convulsive start like a person who suddenly finds himself unable to breathe, but could make no intelligible sound. Then, overcome by her sheer powerlessness, she let her head drop on to the pillows, stretched herself out flat in her bed, her face grave, like a face of marble, her hands motionless on the sheet or occupied in some purely physical action such as that of wiping her fingers with her handkerchief. She made no effort to think. Then came a state of perpetual agitation. She was incessantly trying to get up. But we restrained her so far as we could from doing so, for fear of her discovering how paralysed she was. One day when she had been left alone for a moment I found her standing on the floor in her nightgown trying to open the window.  ���At Balbec, once, when a widow who had jumped into the sea had been rescued against her will, my grandmother had told me (moved perhaps by one of those presentiments which we discern at times in the mystery � so obscure, for all that � of the organic life around us, in which nevertheless it seems that our own future is foreshadowed) that she could think of nothing so cruel as to tear a poor wretch from the death that she had deliberately sought and restore her to her living martyrdom.  ���We were just in time to catch my grandmother, she put up an almost violent resistance to my mother, then, overpowered, seated forcibly in an armchair, she ceased to wish for death, to regret being alive, her face resumed its impassivity and she began laboriously to pick off the hairs that had been left on her nightgown by a fur cloak which somebody had thrown over her shoulders.  ���The look in her eyes changed completely; often uneasy, plaintive, haggard, it was no longer the look we knew, it was the sullen expression of a doddering old woman. . . .  ���By dint of repeatedly asking her whether she would not like her hair done, Fran�oise managed to persuade herself that the request had come from my grandmother. She armed herself with brushes, combs, eau de Cologne, a wrapper. �It can�t hurt Madame Am�d�e,� she said to herself, �if I just comb her; nobody�s ever too ill for a good combing.� In other words, one was never too weak for another person to be able, for her own satisfaction, to comb one. But when I came into the room I saw between the cruel hands of Fran�oise, as blissfully happy as though she were in the act of restoring my grandmother to health, beneath a thin rain of aged tresses which had not the strength to resist the action of the comb, a head which, incapable of maintaining the position into which it had been forced, was rolling to and fro with a ceaseless swirling motion in which sheer debility alternated with spasms of pain. I felt that the moment at which Fran�oise would have finished her task was approaching, and I dared not hasten it by suggesting to her: �That is enough,� for fear of her disobeying me. But I did forcibly intervene when, in order that my grandmother might see whether her hair had been done to her liking, Fran�oise, with innocent savagery, brought her a glass. I was glad for the moment that I had managed to snatch it from her in time, before my grandmother, whom we had carefully kept without a mirror, could catch even a stray glimpse of a face unlike anything she could have imagined. But, alas, when, a moment later, I leaned over her to kiss that dear forehead which had been so harshly treated, she looked up at me with a puzzled, distrustful, shocked expression: she did not know me.  ���According to our doctor, this was a symptom that the congestion of her brain was increasing. It must be relieved in some way.  ���Cottard was in two minds. Fran�oise hoped at first that they were going to apply �clarified cups.� She looked for the effects of this treatment in my dictionary, but could find no reference to it. Even if she had said �scarified� instead of �clarified� she still would not have found any reference to this adjective, since she did not look any more for it under �S� than under �C�; she did indeed say �clarified� but she wrote (and consequently assumed that the printed word was) �esclarified.� Cottard, to her disappointment, gave the preference, though without much hope, to leeches. When, a few hours later, I went into my grandmother�s room, fastened to her neck, her temples, her ears, the tiny black serpents were writhing among her bloodstained locks, as on the head of Medusa. But in her pale and peaceful entirely motionless face I saw wide open, luminous and calm, her own beautiful eyes, as in days gone by (perhaps even more charged with the light of intelligence than they had been before her illness, since, as she could not speak and must not move, it was to her eyes alone that she entrusted her thought, that thought which at one time occupies an immense place in us, offering us undreamed-of treasures, at another time seems reduced to nothing, then may be reborn, as though by spontaneous generation, by the withdrawal of a few drops of blood), her eyes, soft and liquid like two pools of oil in which the rekindled fire that was now burning lighted before the face of the invalid a reconquered universe. Her calm was no longer the wisdom of despair, but that of hope. She realised that she was better, wished to be careful, not to move, and made me the present only of a charming smile so that I should know that she was feeling better, as she gently pressed my hand.  ���I knew the disgust that my grandmother felt at the sight of certain animals, let alone being touched by them. I knew that it was in consideration of a higher utility that she was enduring the leeches. And so it infuriated me to hear Fran�oise repeating to her with that laugh which people use to a baby, to make it crow: �Oh, look at the little beasties running about on Madame.� This was, moreover, treating our patient with a want of respect, as though she were in her second childhood. But my grandmother, whose face had assumed the calm fortitude of a stoic, did not seem even to hear her.  ���Alas! No sooner had the leeches been taken off than the congestion returned and grew steadily worse. I was surprised to find that at this stage, when my grandmother was so ill, Fran�oise was constantly disappearing. The fact was that she had ordered herself a mourning dress, and did not wish to keep her dressmaker waiting. In the lives of most women, everything, even the greatest sorrow, resolves itself into a question of �trying-on.�  ���A few days later, when I was in bed and sleeping, my mother came to call me in the early hours of the morning. With that tender consideration which, in great crises, people who are crushed by grief shew even for the slightest discomfort of others:  ��� �Forgive me for disturbing your sleep,� she said to me.  ��� �I was not asleep,� I answered as I awoke.  ���I said this in good faith. The great modification which the act of awakening effects in us is not so much that of introducing us to the clear life of consciousness, as that of making us lose all memory of that other, rather more diffused light in which our mind has been resting, as in the opaline depths of the sea. The tide of thought, half veiled from our perception, over which we were drifting still a moment ago, kept us in a state of motion perfectly sufficient to enable us to refer to it by the name of wakefulness. But then our actual awakenings produce an interruption of memory. A little later we describe these states as sleep because we no longer remember them. And when shines that bright star which at the moment of waking illuminates behind the sleeper the whole expanse of his sleep, it makes him imagine for a few moments that this was not a sleeping but a waking state; a shooting star, it must be added, which blots out with the fading of its light not only the false existence but the very appearance of our dream, and merely enables him who has awoken to say to himself: �I was asleep.�  ���In a voice so gentle that she seemed to be afraid of hurting me, my mother asked whether it would tire me too much to get out of bed, and, stroking my hands, went on:  ��� �My poor boy, you have only your Papa and Mamma to help you now.�  ���We went into the sickroom. Bent in a semicircle on the bed a creature other than my grandmother, a sort of wild beast which was coated with her hair and couched amid her bedclothes lay panting, groaning, making the blankets heave with its convulsions. The eyelids were closed, and it was because the one nearer me did not shut properly, rather than because it opened at all that it left visible a chink of eye, misty, filmed, reflecting the dimness both of an organic sense of vision and of a hidden, internal pain. All this agitation was not addressed to us, whom she neither saw nor knew. But if this was only a beast that was stirring there, where coulel my grandmother be? Yes, I could recognise the shape of her nose, which bore no relation now to the rest of her face, but to the corner of which a beauty spot still adhered, and the hand that kept thrusting the blankets aside with a gesture which formerly would have meant that those blankets were pressing upon her, but now meant nothing.  ���Mamma asked me to go for a little vinegar and water with which to sponge my grandmother�s forehead. It was the only thing that refreshed her, thought Mamma, who saw that she was trying to push back her hair. But now one of the servants was signalling to me from the doorway. The news that my grandmother was in the last throes had spread like wildfire through the house. One of those �extra helps� whom people engage at exceptional times to relieve the strain on their servants (a practice which gives deathbeds an air of being social functions) had just opened the front door to the Duc de Guermantes, who was now waiting in the hall and had asked for me: I could not escape him.  ��� �I have just, my dear Sir, heard your tragic news. I should like, as a mark of sympathy, to shake hands with your father.� I made the excuse that I could not very well disturb him at the moment. M. de Guermantes was like a caller who turns up just as one is about to start on a journey. But he felt so intensely the importance of the courtesy he was shewing us that it blinded him to all else, and he insisted upon being taken into the drawing-room. As a general rule, he made a point of going resolutely through the formalities with which he had decided to honour anyone, and took little heed that the trunks were packed or the coffin ready.  ��� �Have you sent for Dieulafoy? No? That was a great mistake. And if you had only asked me, I would have got him to come, he never refuses me anything, although he has refused the Duchesse de Chartres before now. You see, I set myself above a Princess of the Blood. However, in the presence of death we are all equal,� he added, not that he meant to suggest that my grandmother was becoming his equal, but probably because he felt that a prolonged discussion of his power over Dieulafoy and his pre-eminence over the Duchesse de Chartres would not be in very good taste.  ���This advice did not in the least surprise me. I knew that, in the Guermantes set, the name of Dieulafoy was regularly quoted (only with slightly more respect) among those of other tradesmen who were �quite the best� in their respective lines. And the old Duchesse de Mortemart n�eGuermantes (I never could understand, by the way, why, the moment one speaks of a Duchess, one almost invariably says: �The old Duchess of So-and-so� or, alternatively, in a delicate Watteau tone, if she is still young: �The little Duchess of So-and-so,�) would prescribe almost automatically, with a droop of the eyelid, in serious cases: �Dieulafoy, Dieulafoy!� as, if one wanted a place for ices, she would advise: �Poir� Blanche,� or for small pastry �Rebattet, Rebattet.� But I was not aware that my father had, as a matter of fact, just sent for Dieulafoy.  ���At this point my mother, who was waiting impatiently for some cylinders of oxygen which would help my grandmother to breathe more easily, came out herself to the hall where she little expected to find M. de Guermantes. I should have liked to conceal him, had that been possible. But convinced in his own mind that nothing was more essential, could be more gratifying to her or more indispensable to the maintenance of his reputation as a perfect gentleman, he seized me violently by the arm and, although I defended myself as against an assault with repeated protestations of �Sir, Sir, Sir,� dragged me across to Mamma, saying: �Will you do me the great honour of presenting me to your mother?� letting go a little as he came to the last word. And it was so plain to him that the honour was hers that he could not help smiling at her even while he was composing a grave face. There was nothing for it but to mention his name, the sound of which at once started him bowing and scraping, and he was just going to begin the complete ritual of salutation. He apparently proposed to enter into conversation, but my mother, overwhelmed by her grief, told me to come at once and did not reply to the speeches of M. de Guermantes who, expecting to be received as a visitor and finding himself instead left alone in the hall, would have been obliged to retire had he not at that moment caught sight of Saint-Loup who had arrived in Paris that morning and had come to us in haste to inquire for news. �I say, this is a piece of luck!� cried the Duke joyfully, catching his nephew by the sleeve, which he nearly tore off, regardless of the presence of my mother who was again crossing the hall. Saint-Loup was not sorry, I fancy, despite his genuine sympathy, at having missed seeing me, considering his attitude towards myself. He left the house, carried off by his uncle who � having had something very important to say to him and having very nearly gone down to Donci�res on purpose to say it, was beside himself with joy at being able to save himself so much exertion. �Upon my soul, if anybody had told me I had only to cross the courtyard and I should find you here, I should have thought it a huge joke; as your friend M. Bloch would say, it�s a regular farce.� And as he disappeared down the stairs with Robert whom he held by the shoulder: �All the same,� he went on, �it�s quite clear I must have touched the hangman�s rope or something; I do have the most astounding luck.� Not that the Duc de Guermantes was ill-bred; far from it. But he was one of those men who are incapable of putting themselves in the place of other people, who resemble in that respect undertakers and the majority of doctors, and who, after composing their faces and saying: �This is a very painful occasion,� after, if need be, embracing you and advising you to rest, cease to regard a deathbed or a funeral as anything but a social gathering of a more or less restricted kind at which, with a joviality that has been checked for a moment only, they scan the room in search of the person whom they can tell about their own little affairs, or ask to introduce them to some one else, or offer a �lift� in their carriage when it is time to go home. The Duc de Guermantes, while congratulating himself on the �good wind� that had blown him into the arms of his nephew, was still so surprised at the reception � natural as it was � that had been given him by my mother, that he declared later on that she was as disagreeable as my father was civil, that she had �absent fits� during which she seemed literally not to hear a word you said to her, and that in his opinion she had no self-possession and perhaps even was not quite �all there.� At the same time he had been quite prepared (according to what I was told) to put this state of mind down, in part at any rate, to the circumstances, and declared that my mother had seemed to him greatly �affected� by the sad event. But he had still stored up in his limbs all the residue of bows and reverences which he had been prevented from using up, and had so little idea of the real nature of Mamma�s sorrow that he asked me, the day before the funeral, if I was not doing anything to distract her.  ���A half-brother of my grandmother, who was in religion, and whom I had never seen, had telegraphed to Austria, where the head of his Order was, and having as a special privilege obtained leave, arrived that day. Bowed down with grief, he sat by the bedside reading prayers and meditations from a book, without, however, taking his gimlet eyes from the invalid�s face. At one point, when my grandmother was unconscious, the sight of this cleric�s grief began to upset me, and I looked at him tenderly. He appeared surprised by my pity, and then an odd thing happened. He joined his hands in front of his face, like a man absorbed in painful meditation, but, on the assumption that I would then cease to watch him, left, as I observed, a tiny chink between his fingers. And at the moment when my gaze left his face, I saw his sharp eye, which had been making use of its vantage-point behind his hands to observe whether my sympathy were sincere. He was hidden there as in the darkness of a confessional. He saw that I was still looking and at once shut tight the lattice which he had left ajar. I have met him again since then, but never has any reference been made by either of us to that minute. It was tacitly agreed that I had not noticed that he was spying on me. In the priest as in the alienist, there is always an element of the examining magistrate. Besides, what friend is there, however cherished, in whose and our common past there has not been some such episode which we find it convenient to believe that he must have forgotten?  ���The doctor gave my grandmother an injection of morphine, and to make her breathing less troublesome ordered cylinders of oxygen. My mother, the doctor, the nursing sister held these in their hands; as soon as one was exhausted another was put in its place. I had left the room for a few minutes. When I returned I found myself face to face with a miracle. Accompanied on a muted instrument by an incessant murmur, my grandmother seemed to be greeting us with a long and blissful chant, which filled the room, rapid and musical. I soon realized that this was scarcely less unconscious, that it was as purely mechanical as the hoarse rattle that I had heard before leaving the room. Perhaps to a slight extent it reflected some improvement brought about by the morphine. Principally it was the result (the air not passing quite in the same way through the bronchial tubes) of a change in the register of her breathing. Released by the twofold action of the oxygen and the morphine, my grandmother�s breath no longer laboured, panted, groaned, but, swift and light, shot like a skater along the delicious stream. Perhaps with her breath, unconscious like that of the wind in the hollow stem of a reed, there were blended in this chant some of those more human sighs which, liberated at the approach of death, make us imagine impressions of suffering or happiness in minds which already have ceased to feel, and these sighs came now to add a more melodious accent, but without changing its rhythm, to that long phrase which rose, mounted still higher, then declined, to start forth afresh, from her unburdened bosom in quest of the oxygen. Then, having risen to so high a pitch, having been sustained with so much vigour, the chant, mingled with a murmur of supplication from the midst of her ecstasy, seemed at times to stop altogether like a spring that has ceased to flow.  ���Fran�oise, in any great sorrow, felt the need but did not possess the art � as simple as that need was futile � of giving it expression. Regarding my grandmother�s case as quite hopeless, it was her own personal impressions that she was impelled to communicate to us. And all that she could do was to repeat: �It makes me feel all queer,� in the same tone in which she would say, when she had taken too large a plateful of cabbage broth: �It�s like a load on my stomach,� sensations both of which were more natural than she seemed to think. Though so feebly expressed, her grief was nevertheless very great, and was aggravated moreover by her annoyance that her daughter, detained at Combray (to which this young Parisian now referred as �the Cambrousse� and where she felt herself growing �p�trousse,� in other words fossilised), would not, presumably, be able to return in time for the funeral ceremony, which was certain, Fran�oise felt, to be a superb spectacle. Knowing that we were not inclined to be expansive, she made Jupien promise at all costs to keep every evening in the week free. She knew that he would be engaged elsewhere at the hour of the funeral. She was determined at least to �go over it all� with him on his return.  ���For several nights now my father, my grandfather and one of our cousins had been sitting up, and never left the house during the day. Their continuous devotion ended by assuming a mask of indifference, and their interminable leisure round the deathbed made them indulge in that small talk which is an inseparable accompaniment of prolonged confinement in a railway carriage. Anyhow this cousin (a nephew of my great-aunt) aroused in me an antipathy as strong as the esteem which he deserved and generally enjoyed. He was always �sent for� in times of great trouble, and was so assiduous in his attentions to the dying that their mourning families, on the pretext that he was in delicate health, despite his robust appearance, his bass voice and bristling beard, invariably besought him, with the customary euphemisms, not to come to the cemetery. I could tell already that Mamma, who thought of others in the midst of the most crushing grief, would soon be saying to him, in a very different form of words, what he was in the habit of hearing said on all such occasions:  ��� �Promise me that you won�t come �to-morrow.� Please, for �her sake.� At any rate, you won�t go �all the way.� It�s what she would have wished.�  ���But there was nothing for it; he was always the first to arrive �at the house,� by reason of which he had been given, among another set, the nickname (unknown to us) of �No flowers by request.� And before attending everything he had always �attended to everything,� which entitled him to the formula: �We don�t know how to thank you.�  ��� �What�s that?� came in a loud voice from my grandfather, who had grown rather deaf and had failed to catch something which our cousin had just said to my father.  ��� �Nothing,� answered the cousin. �I was just saying that I�d heard from Combray this morning. The weather is appalling down there, and here we�ve got too much sun.�  ��� �Yet the barometer is very low,� put in my father.  ��� �Where did you say the weather was bad?� asked my grandfather.  ��� �At Combray.�  ��� �Ah! I�m not surprised; whenever it�s bad here it�s fine at Combray, and vice versa. Good gracious! Talking of Combray, has anyone remembered to tell Legrandin?�  ��� �Yes, don�t worry about that, it�s been done,� said my cousin, whose cheeks, bronzed by an irrepressible growth of beard, dimpled faintly with the satisfaction of having �remembered� it.  ���At this point my father hurried from the room. I supposed that a sudden change, for better or worse, had occurred. It was simply that Dr. Dieulafoy had just arrived. My father went to receive him in the drawing-room, like the actor who is to come next on the stage. We had sent for him not to cure but to certify, in almost a legal capacity. Dr. Dieulafoy might indeed be a great physician, a marvellous professor; to these several parts, in which he excelled, he added a third, in which he remained for forty years without a rival, a part as original as that of the arguer, the scaramouch or the noble father, which consisted in coming to certify an agony or a death. The mere sound of his name foreshadowed the dignity with which he would sustain the part, and when the servant announced: �M. Dieulafoy,� one imagined oneself at a play by Moli�re. To the dignity of his attitude was added, without being conspicuous, the suppleness of a perfect figure. A face in itself too good-looking was toned down by the convention due to distressing circumstances. In the sable majesty of his frock coat the Professor entered the room, melancholy without affectation, uttered not the least word of condolence, which might have been thought insincere, nor was he guilty of the slightest infringement of the rules of tact. At the foot of a deathbed it was he and not the Duc de Guermantes who was the great gentleman Having examined my grandmother, but not so as to tire her, and with ari excess of reserve which was an act of courtesy to the doctor who was treating the case, he murmured a few words to my father, bowed respectfully to my mother to whom I felt that my father had positively to restrain himself from saying: �Professor Dieulafoy.� But already our visitor had turned away, not wishing to seem to be soliciting an introduction, and left the room in the most polished manner conceivable, simply taking with him the sealed envelope that was slipped into his hand. He had not appeared to see it, and we ourselves were left wondering for a moment whether we had really given it to him, such a conjurer�s nimbleness had he put into the act of making it vanish without thereby losing anything of the gravity � which was increased rather � of the great consultant in his long frock coat with its silken lapels, and his handsome head full of a noble commiseration. The slowness and vivacity of his movements shewed that, even if he had a hundred other visits to pay and patients waiting, he refused to appear hurried. For he was the embodiment of tact, intelligence and kindness. That eminent man is no longer with us. Other physicians, other professors may have rivalled, may indeed have surpassed him. But the �capacity� in which his knowledge, his physical endowments, his distinguished manners made him triumph exists no longer for want of any successor capable of taking his place. Mamma had not even noticed M. Dieulafoy, everything that was not my grandmother having no existence for her. I remember (and here I anticipate) that at the cemetery, where we saw her, like a supernatural apparition, go up timidly to the grave and seem to be gazing in the wake of a flying form that was already far away, my father having remarked to her: �Old Norpois came to the house and to the church and on here; he gave up a most important committee meeting to come; you ought really to say a word to him, he�ll be so gratified if you do,� my mother, when the Ambassador stood before her and bowed, could do no more than gently incline a face that shewed no tears. A couple of days earlier � to anticipate once again before returning to where we were just now by the bed on which my grandmother lay dying � while they were watching by the body, Fran�oise, who, not disbelieving entirely in ghosts, was terrified by the least sound, had said: �I believe that�s her.� But in place of fear it was an ineffable sweetness that her words aroused in my mother, who would have been so glad that the dead should return, to have her mother with her sometimes still.  ���To return now to those last hours, �You heard about the telegram her sisters sent us?� my grandfather asked the cousin.  ��� �Yes, Beethoven, they told me about it, it�s worth framing; still, I�m not surprised.�  ��� �My poor wife, who was so fond of them, too,� said my grandfather, wiping away a tear. �We mustn�t blame them. They�re stark mad, both of them, as I�ve always said. What�s the matter now; aren�t you going on with the oxygen?�  ���My mother spoke: �Oh, but then Mamma will be having more trouble with her breathing.�  ���The doctor reassured her: �Oh, no! The effect of the oxygen will last a good while yet; we can begin it again presently.�  ���It seemed to me that he would not have said this of a dying woman, that if this good effect were to last it meant that we could still do something to keep her alive. The hiss of the oxygen ceased for a few moments, But the happy plaint of her breathing poured out steadily, light, troubled, unfinished, without end, beginning afresh. Now and then it seemed that all was over, her breath stopped, whether owing to one of those transpositions to another octave that occur in the breathing of a sleeper, or else from a natural interruption, an effect of unconsciousness, the progress of asphyxia, some failure of the heart. The doctor stooped to feel my grandmother�s pulse, but already, as if a tributary were pouring its current into the dried river-bed, a fresh chant broke out from the interrupted measure. And the first was resumed in another pitch with the same inexhaustible force. Who knows whether, without indeed my grandmother�s being conscious of them, a countless throng of happy and tender memories compressed by suffering were not escaping from her now, like those lighter gases which had long been compressed in the cylinders? One would have said that everything thai she had to tell us was pouring out, that it was to us that she was addressing herself with this prolixity, this earnestness, this effusion. At the foot of the bed, convulsed by every gasp of this agony, not weeping but now and then drenched with tears, my mother presented the unreasoning desolation of a leaf which the rain lashes and the wind twirls on its stem. They made me dry my eyes before I went up to kiss my grandmother.  ��� �But I thought she couldn�t see anything now?� said my father.  ��� �One can never be sure,� replied the doctor.  ���When my lips touched her face, my grandmother�s hands quivered, a long shudder ran through her whole body, reflex perhaps, perhaps because certain affections have their hyperaesthesia which recognises through the veil of unconsciousness what they barely need senses to enable them to love. Suddenly my grandmother half rose, made a violent effort, as though struggling to resist an attempt on her life. Fran�oise could not endure this sight and burst out sobbing. Remembering what the doctor had just said I tried to make her leave the room. At that moment my grandmother opened her eyes. I thrust myself hurriedly in front of Fran�oise to hide her tears, while my parents were speaking to the sufferer. The sound of the oxygen had ceased; the doctor moved away from the bedside. My grandmother was dead.  ���An hour or two later Fran�oise was able for the last time, and without causing them any pain, to comb those beautiful tresses which had only begun to turn grey and hitherto had seemed not so old as my grandmother herself. But now on the contrary it was they alone that set the crown of age on a face grown young again, from which had vanished the wrinkles, the contractions, the swellings, the strains, the hollows which in the long course of years had been carved on it by suffering. As at the far-off time when her parents had chosen for her a bridegroom, she had the features delicately traced by purity and submission, the cheeks glowing with a chaste expectation, with a vision of happiness, with an innocent gaiety even which the years had gradually destroyed. Life in withdrawing from her had taken with it the disillusionments of life. A smile seemed to be hovering on my grandmother�s lips. On that funeral couch, death, like a sculptor of the middle ages, had laid her in the form of a young maiden.Embed;

This little empty garden by the brownstone door And in the cracks along the sidewalk Nothin' grows no more Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop And we are so amazed We're crippled and we're dazed A gardener like that one No one can replace   And I've been knockin' But no one answers And I've been knockin' Most of the day Oh, and I've been callin' "Oh, hey, hey, Johnny Can't you come out to play?"

Exhale (Shoop Shoop) - from "Waiting to Exhale" - Original Soundtrack;Whitney Houston;pop; 1. EXT. NEW YORK - LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY The STATUE OF LIBERTY stands watch at the mouth of the Hudson.  Over scene, we SUPER TITLE:  NEW YORK CITY - JULY 1976  2. JERSEY CITY PIER - DAY A live news update.  Network correspondent CINDY CHAN stands at the edge of the  dock, the statue plainly visible in the distance behind her.  CINDY -- insist that the situation is under control.  Authorities have just agreed to the release of nine Radical Front prisoners in hopes of freeing the hostages. (adjusting her hair) We repeat: terrorists have taken Liberty Island, and are holding some forty hostages -- including tourists and maintenance workers -- captive in the Statue of Liberty itself.  3. FERRYBOAT - DAY The ferry -- one of six anchored a half-mile off Liberty Island -- has been commandeered by a fully-armed SWAT TEAM.  The SWAT CAPTAIN, who's in charge of negotiations, speaks to the terrorists via walkie-talkie. SWAT CAPTAIN Your demands have been met.  The prisoners and the money are on their way.  If you tune your TV to Channel 4 you'll see the copters preparing for takeoff.  4. INT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT The screen of a portable TV shows THREE HELICOPTERS lifting off from Laguardia.  We're in the OBSERVATION ROOM inside the statue's head. A TERRORIST holds a crowd of SQUEALING TOURISTS -- men, women, schoolchildren -- at bay with an automatic rifle.  Two others stand by the windows, scanning the harbor for signs of a double-cross; and a fourth, the RINGLEADER, speaks into a walkie-talkie.  RINGLEADER Good.  We got forty innocent people here.  One false move . . . and we blow her brains out.  SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.) (filter; from walkie-talkie) Blow whose brains out?  5. EXT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT TIGHT on the ring of OBSERVATION WINDOWS situated just below the jutting spikes of the CROWN.  CAMERA PULLS BACK rapidly to take in the whole of the statue's head. RINGLEADER (O.S.) (a nasty laugh) Lady Liberty, my friend.  Lady Liberty's brains!  6. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT - DAY MOUNTING TENSION among the SWAT TEAM on deck.  SWAT COP Sons of bitches.  SWAT CAPTAIN Relax.  We'll nail 'em on the transfer.  Let's get those hostages out first.  SWAT COP II Captain . . . what the hell is that?  All eyes turn upward.  In the distance, a TINY SPECK descends from the clouds and drops, in a perfectly vertical line, toward the head of the statue.  The SWAT CAPTAIN hoists a pair of binoculars:  SWAT CAPTAIN Shit.  Shit fire!!  SWAT COP Sir!  What is it? 7. POV SHOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS A magnified view of the SPECK, which turns out to be a futuristic, blimplike HOVERCRAFT -- the OWLSHIP.  SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.) Christ almighty, it's the goddamned Watchmen!  8. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT In the cabin we find THREE COSTUMED SUPERHEROES: the red-and-gold suited CAPTAIN METROPOLIS; RORSCHACH, whose face is a shifting inkblot mask; and NIGHT OWL, who's manning the instrument panel.  NIGHT OWL Okay, Adrian, we're in position.  What now?  He looks up at a monitor mounted over the controls.  ADRIAN VEIDT, blond scientific wizard, answers pensively from Watchmen HQ:  VEIDT (on monitor) Let's take out their communications.  Drop the scrambler.  9. EXT. HEAD OF STATUE - DAY A line drops from the OWLSHIP, and an ELECTRONIC DEVICE lands with a thud on the dome of Lady Liberty's crown.  10. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT TERRORISTS staring at the portable TV screen; suddenly, it shows nothing but snow.  The RINGLEADER, suspicious, lifts his walkie-talkie:  RINGLEADER Hey.  We got a problem here --  He releases the button.  No reply -- only loud, hissing STATIC.  RINGLEADER Come in.  Do you read me?  Don't play around with us, Goddammit !  11. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT The SWAT CAPTAIN curses at his useless walkie-talkie.  Teeth bared, he glowers up at the OWLSHIP and paces the deck in a psychotic frenzy.  SWAT COP Ignorant bastards!  They've jammed us!  SWAT COP II What do we do now?  SWAT CAPTAIN We sit here with our thumbs up our butts.  As usual.  12. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY A HULKING FIGURE, outfitted in SCUBA GEAR, emerges from the water. There's an evil-looking RIFLE slung over his shoulder.  As he swaggers toward the base of the statue, he peels off his wetsuit to reveal yet another gaudy COSTUME underneath.  Superhero #4: THE COMEDIAN.  He pins a BADGE to his leather breastplate; incongruously, it's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON -- and it matches his own nasty SMILE as he marches forward into battle.  13. INT. BASE OF STATUE - THAT MOMENT - DAY A TRIO OF TERRORISTS standing guard near the entrance in the base of the statue.  They're holding a JANITOR at gunpoint.  One of them is fumbling with his walkie-talkie, which has inexplicably gone haywire.  TERRORIST I Base to head.  Base to head.  Come in! (flustered) I can't get shit!  TERRORIST II What the hell is going on??  There's a sudden metallic CLANG behind them.  They turn in unison -- just as the COMEDIAN struts into frame, assault rifle in hand.  Panic.  The three TERRORISTS fall into a tight cluster at the base of a long metal stairway.  One of them grabs the JANITOR, holds a gun to his head.  TERRORIST I I'M NOT JOKING!!  The COMEDIAN shrugs: okay.  He lifts his rifle and fires TWO SILENCED SHOTS directly into the JANITOR's gut.  The old man's body jerks twice and he slumps to the floor, stone dead.  The TERRORISTS stand there aghast.  For an instant they're too stunned to shoot.  The COMEDIAN breaks into a dopey grin --  COMEDIAN The joke's on you.  -- and opens fire with a look of VICIOUS PLEASURE on his face.  As the saying goes . . . it's nice to see a man who enjoys his work.  14. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS stand over an open hatch in the floor of the cabin.  At the console, NIGHT OWL hits a button.  Then --  15. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY A sudden BOOM.  A FLASH OF COLOR.  The startled TERRORISTS turn to the nearest window, and see a spectacular display of BICENTENNIAL FIREWORKS bursting above the harbor a short distance away.  While the TERRORISTS are distracted, our attention shifts to a point behind them.  Through an OBSERVATION WINDOW we see CAPT. METROPOLIS and RORSCHACH sliding down a thin metal cable and LANDING on the statue's upraised TORCH.  The TERRORISTS turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the far side of the torch.  RINGLEADER I don't like this.  Go downstairs and see what's up.  16. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - THAT MOMENT - DAY RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS pry open a metal door on the torch.  RORSCHACH Got your flashgun?  CAPT. METROPOLIS nods.  He puts on a pair of IONIZED SUNGLASSES and goes through the door, into the torch.  RORSCHACH waits behind.  17. INT. BASE OF STATUE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY The COMEDIAN is wandering around with a MAP of the statue's layout. He spots what looks like a MANHOLE COVER set in the concrete floor, then strolls over and jimmies it open.  ANOTHER FIGURE in scuba gear climbs out.  But this one's different. This one's a WOMAN.  SILK SPECTRE About time.  It stinks down there.  COMEDIAN B-team's upstairs.  We gotta find that bomb.  As the COMEDIAN saunters off, she strips out of her slime-drenched wetsuit.  You guessed it -- a garish (and kinda skimpy) COSTUME underneath.  SILK SPECTRE Why do I get all the glamour jobs?  COMEDIAN A woman's work is never done.  18. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT - DAY The TERRORISTS tense up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS.  A moment later, CAPT. METROPOLIS appears on the stairs.  The TERRORISTS train their guns on him -- all but the RINGLEADER, who grabs a TEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL.  RINGLEADER I don't know who you are pal, but you just killed a little girl.  CAPT. METROPOLIS Please.  There's something I'd like you to see first.  He holds up what looks like an old-fashioned photographer's flash. All at once, the ROOM GOES WHITE -- and by the time the blinding light has dimmed, TERRORISTS and HOSTAGES alike are toppling to the floor, their nervous systems temporarily FRIED.  All except CAPT. METROPOLIS, who's wearing his special sunglasses. He pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work.  19. INT. STATUE - NEAR BASE - A MOMENT LATER An edgy TERRORIST all alone, standing watch.  Suddenly he's grabbed from behind -- and THE COMEDIAN is holding the point of a BAYONET at his throat.  COMEDIAN Okay, Abdul.  Where's the bomb?  20. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY Everyone's slowly coming around.  By now CAPT. METROPOLIS has the TERRORISTS tied up; he's consoling a squawling THREE-YEAR-OLD.  CAPT. METROPOLIS Don't cry, little one.  You're in good hands. (standing; to the crowd) Now everyone.  Listen carefully.  We're going out through the torch.  He goes to a window, gives the thumbs-up sign to RORSCHACH out on the torch.  RORSCHACH signals the OWLSHIP.  21. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - A MOMENT LATER A METAL LADDER descends from the belly of the OWLSHIP.  RORSCHACH secures it to the tip of the torch.  22.  INT. STATUE - MIDSECTION - THAT MOMENT SILK SPECTRE and THE COMEDIAN marching up a long metal stairway.  SILK SPECTRE Should be just overhead.  We have to distract them somehow . . .  COMEDIAN Just barge in.  While they're staring at your tits we'll blow their balls off.  They look up.  A TERRORIST is peering down at them from an overhead landing.  The COMEDIAN lifts his rifle: thwip.  Before the terrorist hits the floor, the COMEDIAN has lobbed a GAS GRENADE onto the landing.  23. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - A MOMENT LATER Gas everywhere.  The TERRORISTS' BOMB, and it's a big fat one, sits in a complicated housing at the center of the landing, with UNCONSCIOUS TERRORISTS sprawled all around it.  SILK SPECTRE and the COMEDIAN, in gas masks, march up the stairs to scope things out:  COMEDIAN Well.  They look distracted. (turning to face her) Don't suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies . . . ?  SILK SPECTRE Eddie -- !  Suddenly panicked, she grabs his shoulder, points behind him.  He turns.  One of the TERRORISTS still has some life in him.  He drags himself over to the bomb and -- with his last ounce of strength -- FLIPS A SWITCH on the housing.  A TIMER begins to count down.  Thirty seconds.  Twenty-nine.  COMEDIAN SHIT!  He hits a trigger on his belt, and a RED SIGNAL LIGHT begins to blink.  He spots an elevator door, runs over, and pries it open.  An empty shaft; the car is some twenty stories below them.  SILK SPECTRE What about the --  COMEDIAN FUCK 'EM!  There's a mountain-climber's CARABINER on his belt; he fastens it around the ELEVATOR CABLE -- and DROPS.  SILK SPECTRE hesitates only a second before following suit.  24. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER CAPT. METROPOLIS is herding HOSTAGES down the stairway.  All at once, he FREEZES.  There's a red SIGNAL LIGHT flashing on his belt as well.  25. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT YET ANOTHER RED LIGHT is flashing on NIGHT OWL's instrument panel. He looks up at VEIDT on the monitor.  NIGHT OWL Adrian!  VEIDT Yeah, I see it.  Mission aborted.  NIGHT OWL Well, good God, we can't just --  VEIDT Mission aborted, Daniel!  NIGHT OWL reluctantly agrees.  He lets out the throttle.  26. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - THAT MOMENT On the BOMB.  The timer shows ten seconds to go.  27. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - A MOMENT LATER The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE plummet downward, their BELT CLASPS throwing off sparks against the cable.  28. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER CAPT. METROPOLIS at the window, petrified with fear, his hands pressed to the glass.  He watches as the OWLSHIP flies away -- and RORSCHACH, who's hanging onto the metal ladder, is YANKED BODILY off the torch.  29. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT THE COMEDIAN makes a hard landing on the roof of a car.  SILK SPECTRE touches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator doors open, and the two of them dive through.  30. AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER HARBOR - A MOMENT LATER RORSCHACH clings desperately to the metal ladder as the OWLSHIP streaks across the harbor.  Behind him is the rapidly receding figure of Lady Liberty.  Three beats later, a GAPING HOLE blows open in her midsection.  31.  INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT A heartsick NIGHT OWL pounds the control panel in frustration.  On an overhead monitor, the upper portion of the statue is TOPPLING.  32. INT. STATUE - A MOMENT LATER Smoke everywhere.  The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE are pressed flat against a CONCRETE BULKHEAD.  An overhang protects them from falling DEBRIS -- which is raining down in copious amounts.  33. EXT. FERRY - A MOMENT LATER The furious SWAT CAPTAIN watches in astonishment as the top half of the statue disintegrates into RUBBLE and tumbles to the ground.  He turns away from the sight, shaking his head in vehement disgust.  SWAT CAPTAIN That's it.  I quit.  The water stirs.  The boat begins to ROCK.  On deck, all eyes turn --  34. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY -- as a LUMINOUS BLUE-SKINNED GIANT, SIXTY FEET TALL, wades through the harbor and steps up onto the island.  He stares in dismay at the demolished statue . . . like a modern-day Colossus of Rhodes wondering what the hell happened to his date.  Meet the last -- and most powerful -- member of our happy band: DR. MANHATTAN.  Down below, THE COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE -- battered but intact -- are crawling out of the wreckage.  The COMEDIAN looks up at the huge blue figure looming over them, and shakes a gnat-sized fist:  COMEDIAN ASSHOLE!  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!?  CUT TO:  35. INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT The Channel 4 Newsroom, with anchors SHEILA SHEA and JIM BRADLEY.  SHEILA In the face of mounting public pressure, the city of New York has revoked its contract with Adrian Veidt's super-team.  Local police have threatened a city-wide walkout if criminal charges against the Watchmen are dropped.  On the bluescreen behind them, red circles with diagonal crossbars surround SIX HEAD SHOTS of the individual WATCHMEN.  JIM And in Washington today, the Senate introduced legislation which would ban all costumed adventurers nationwide.  Easy passage is expected. (shuffling his papers) Well, Sheila, it looks like the age of the superhero is officially history.  DISSOLVE TO:  36.  CREDITS SEQUENCE TIMEPIECES of every description -- pocket watches, grandfather clocks, travel alarms, all perfectly synchronized -- DRIFT UPWARD through a vast black void, ticking off the seconds.  At the stroke of midnight, GONGS sound, BUZZERS buzz, BELLS tinkle -- and without warning the clocks EXPLODE.  As gears and coils and crystals cascade downward through the void, we SUPER TITLE:  WATCHMEN  FADE THROUGH TO:  37. EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT Darkened windows glow with the dim fire of reflected neon as we TILT UP the towering facade of a forty-story apartment building.  A BLIMP drifts lazily through distant clouds; the sounds of traffic echo faint and dreamlike in the wind as we reach the penthouse -- where heavy curtains flutter behind the ragged matte of a SHATTERED PLATE-GLASS WINDOW.  SUPER TITLE:  NEW YORK CITY - TEN YEARS LATER  38. EXT. STREET BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A ramshackle NEWS KIOSK.  The OWNER, fat and stubbly, sits framed by the garish covers of comic books and nudie mags, staring at the high-rise across the street.  THREE POLICE CARS -- oddly truncated bubble-shaped vehicles, recognizable from the flashing red beacons on their roofs -- sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS.  A CUSTOMER picks up a copy of the New York Gazette: "NEW SKIRMISH ON AFGHAN BORDER.  RUSSKIES WALK OUT ON PEACE POWWOW."  CUSTOMER Crazy reds don't know who they're messing with. (indicating the cop cars) What happened over there?  NEWS VENDOR Some guy went sidewalk divin'  Twenny-five cents.  39. EXT. HIGH-RISE - STREET LEVEL - NIGHT A riot of noise and color.  A plainclothes COP takes a statement from the DOORMAN as PEDESTRIANS, clustered around an NYPD cordon, stare with sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk.  PATROLMAN STAND BACK!  MOVE ALONG!  We are not in New York as we know it; in this strange offshoot of reality, everything -- the clothes, the cars, the very look of the city -- seems just a touch off.  The PATROLMAN, for instance: his standard-issue uniform consists of full riot gear, and his plastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery.  He clears a path for a squad of PARAMEDICS, who load a bloody parcel into the back of a waiting ambulance.  DET. LT. BURNS climbs out of his car, squeezes through the crowd and buttonholes his colleague, HYDE, the cop in charge of the investigation.  BURNS Had a lot of blood in him.  HYDE You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.  BURNS No idea who's behind this?  HYDE Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.  BURNS nods once and stares up toward the penthouse window.  BURNS He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.  HYDE Washington?  BURNS They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.  HYDE, suddenly wide-eyed at this new development, stares off after the ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic.  40. EXT. STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT  TIGHT ON a large placard: "THE END IS NIGH."  The bearer of the sign, a hunched STREET CRAZY in a ratty raincoat, plods up the sidewalk spreading his message of cheer; his back is to us, but we can make out an unruly shock of bright RED HAIR.  The NEWS VENDOR eyes him suspiciously as he passes, then turns up his collar and looks pointedly away.  A SMALL BLACK KID, leaning against the kiosk with a comic book, spots him too, and makes a quick, cross-eyed face.  The STREET CRAZY lets out a low, hissing GROWL in response and plugs on.  At the high-rise, a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the sidewalks; RIVULETS OF WATER crisscross the street.  As the STREET CRAZY wanders along,  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain grate.  It's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON.  A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its surface, like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to midnight.  The STREET CRAZY bends to retrieve it.  He stares off at the shattered window some forty stories above.  DISSOLVE TO:  41. INT. HIGH-RISE - HALLWAY - NIGHT CAMERA DRIFTS from the penthouse elevator down a long, plush-carpeted corridor.  The hallway is cordoned with thin plastic strips reading "POLICE LINE -- DO NOT CROSS."  At the far end is a single door, SEALED OFF.  42. INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT MOONLIGHT SHINES on an obstacle course of broken chairs and overturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture window.  At this altitude, the wind is fierce, and the curtains are flapping wildly.  A ROPE drops into view.  A DARK SILHOUETTE lands on the ledge outside.  SHARDS OF GLASS crunch underfoot as this strange INTRUDER steps inside.  He wears a slouch hat, a heavy trenchcoat; his face is invisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the room.  The apartment is, as promised, a slaughterhouse: smashed art prints, gaping holes in the wallboard, and gallons of BLOOD everywhere.  The flashlight beam shines on the front door, where THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS and an electronic alarm system are still in place, undisturbed.  The INTRUDER turns suddenly.  His beam strikes the splintered remains of a full-length WALL MIRROR -- and there, in the cracked and spiky glass, we get our first good look at his face.  Or what passes for his face.  He has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing but a strange and ever-shifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should be. . .a living, crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white.  We've met him before.  He goes by the name of RORSCHACH.  43. INT. PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT RORSCHACH'S BEAM falls on the kitchen table.  HUNGRY FLIES walk dainty-legged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood. Offhandedly, he brushes the flies away; then he spots a SUGAR BOWL. He tips it over, scoops up a handful of cubes, deposits them in his trenchcoat pocket.  44. INT. PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT The beam shines across rumpled bedclothes, searches around the walls, and settles finally on the half-open door to a walk-in closet. RORSCHACH steps inside, examines rack upon rack of expensive suits.  He shoves the suits aside.  Then, mysteriously, he begins to POUND on the wall with his fist, moving left, right, up, down: THUMP.  THUMP. THUMP.  He pauses.  He's found a hollow section.  He feels his way carefully along the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a CONCEALED TRIGGER.  He presses it and a panel slides back, revealing a SECOND, SECRET CLOSET, hidden inside the first.  He reaches up, flicks on a light.  Inside the secret closet: a bizarre UNIFORM -- helmet, mask and gloves, a gaudy-colored bodysuit, rows of exotic weaponry.  On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed PHOTOGRAPH.  RORSCHACH examines the photo.  It's a group shot, six men, one woman, all dressed in similarly garish uniforms.  The man in the center is wearing the costume on the wall before us. . .the COMEDIAN's costume.  They're all there, all the Watchmen: NIGHT OWL.  SILK SPECTRE.  CAPT. METROPOLIS.  DR. MANHATTAN.  ADRIAN VEIDT.  And of course, RORSCHACH himself.  As he eyes this quirky memento of days gone by, we  DISSOLVE TO:  45. EXT. STREET CORNER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT A LIGHT RAIN is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner store.  DANIEL DREIBERG, 44, thickset and bespectacled, walks with the heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed.  He seems meek, defeated -- old before his time.  He holds a hand to the skies, sets down his grocery bags long enough to open an umbrella.  Then he turns down a deserted access street.  46. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT In an alleyway just off the access street, there's a MUGGING in progress: two young street toughs, their tinted hair tied up in knot-tops, rolling a middle-aged man.  Across the street, DREIBERG sees what's happening; it takes some effort, but he makes a conscious decision to move on.  Then --  VOICE Hold up, papa-san!  The KNOT-TOPS have emerged from the alleyway with their loot, and spotted DREIBERG -- an unwanted witness.  Menace in their eyes, they march toward him.  He sets his bags down and turns to face them, almost welcoming the challenge; and suddenly, without warning, we  CUT TO:  47. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE Slow-mo, double-frame, or sepia-tone; you call it.  But whatever the gimmick, it should suggest that the events we're watching take place in a stylized dream-time, midway between flashback and fantasy.  It's out old friend NIGHT OWL, duking it out with a gang of HOODS in an alleyway not unlike the one we've just left.  There's a flurry of fists; the HOODS topple, in quick succession--  -- and all at once a burst of BLINDING LIGHT BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME, transporting us back to:  48. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT Real-time again.  Our reverie's been interrupted by a SHAFT OF WHITE-HOT LIGHT sweeping across the street, past DREIBERG, toward the alley.  LOUDSPEAKER HALT!  DO NOT TRY TO RESIST --  The KNOT-TOPS run for it.  DREIBERG shields his eyes against the LIGHT -- which emanates from a POLICE HOVERCRAFT hanging in midair some forty feet above his head.  The craft swoops off in pursuit of the kids.  DREIBERG bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the alleyway.  He finds the old man slumped against a wall, obviously past help.  49. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS slide back as DREIBERG lets himself in.  The security system is almost as impressive as the one in the COMEDIAN's apartment, but the decor is considerably less plush.  DREIBERG sets his bags on the floor, removes his raincoat, and hangs it carefully in a closet.  Then he gathers his groceries, heads for the kitchen -- and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, confronted with a most peculiar sight:  DREIBERG . . . Rorschach.  50. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT Leaning back in a chair, his feet propped up on the kitchen table, is the aforementioned RORSCHACH.  His inkblot mask is rolled partway up, exposing a mouthful of bad teeth, and he's calmly eating a plate of baked beans.  DREIBERG How did you get in here?  Ignoring the question, RORSCHACH greets him in a soft, rasping, utterly emotionless whisper:  RORSCHACH Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.  DREIBERG Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?  DREIBERG is mildly panicked.  RORSCHACH -- who couldn't care less -- emits his trademark hissing GROWL.  He spoons more beans from a can onto his plate, tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup from a squeeze bottle.  DREIBERG (cont.) I can't believe you're back on the streets.  Good God, man, you're wanted on fourteen counts of murder.  RORSCHACH At least six of those are trumped-up.  -- Here.  He reaches into his pocket, finds the HAPPY-FACE button, and flips it to DREIBERG.  DREIBERG eyes it for a moment, automatically uses his fingernail to scrape at the small red STAIN on its surface.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Look familiar?  DREIBERG Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.  RORSCHACH Human bean juice. (beat) The Comedian is dead.  DREIBERG stares down at the button, suddenly getting the picture. His jaw goes slack.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Had a real nice place -- penthouse suite, forty stories up -- beautiful view. Hope he enjoyed it on the way down.  DREIBERG Jesus.  What.  A burglar . . . ?  RORSCHACH snorts: the possibility is too comical to consider.  DREIBERG (cont.) Well, God, he'd been working with the CTU for almost a decade -- he must've had enemies.  RORSCHACH So do I.  So do you.  DREIBERG Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.  RORSCHACH's head jerks violently at the sound of the word.  DREIBERG blinks involuntarily, half-expecting some kind of reprisal.  But RORSCHACH merely stands, adjusts his mask, and starts toward the front door.  RORSCHACH Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge. (pause) Thought you might want to spread the word.  DREIBERG Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?  RORSCHACH growls, shakes his head in disgust -- but complies.  He opens the back door, pauses, turns to DREIBERG.  RORSCHACH You the sentimental type, Daniel?  -- Brought you a souvenir.  He reaches into his trenchcoat and hands DREIBERG the framed photo from the COMEDIAN's wall.  A moment later, he's gone.  DREIBERG sits down, unnerved.  As he reaches for the wall phone, CAMERA ZEROES IN on a face from the photo: a blonde man, in a purple tunic and mask . . .  51. INT. OFFICE SUITE - DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT A GREAT SHADOWY JUNGLE CAT pads across acres of carpet.  The cat is far from its natural habitat; in back of it is a glass-and-chrome desk outfitted with a computer terminal, and at the terminal is ADRIAN VEIDT, the brains behind the Watchmen.  Although he's DREIBERG's age, his face is serene and unlined by worry.  Blond and pale, he looks thirty.  When he's sixty he'll look forty.  VEIDT -- millionaire industrialist, and holder of over forty basic patents -- is also something of an Egyptologist, and the decor of his office reflects it: ancient vases sarcophagi, busts of Anubis, and the like.  He keys a string of figures into the computer; the PHONE RINGS.  VEIDT Veidt here.  52. INTERCUT DREIBERG AND VEIDT DREIBERG Adrian?  Listen, it's Dreiberg.  I just had a visit from Rorschach. I had to call you before he --  VEIDT Daniel, slow down.  What's this about Rorschach?  DREIBERG The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.  VEIDT My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?  DREIBERG It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.  VEIDT Us.  You mean the Watchmen.  The big CAT purrs; it's a mutant lynx, genetically tailored, with red fur and long, tufted, antenna-like ears.  VEIDT tosses the lynx a chunk of raw meat from a platter on his deak while he ponders DREIBERG's words.  VEIDT (cont.) Daniel, Rorschach is insane.  DREIBERG I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.  VEIDT You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.  DREIBERG He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.  VEIDT If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I? (slight pause) Do you need money?  DREIBERG No.  I just wanted you to --  VEIDT You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.  DREIBERG Good night.  VEIDT leans back in his chair, reaches for a gold case and extracts a cigarette.  It's "matchless"; you ignite it guy striking the tip of the cigarette against the edge of the case.  He lights up and takes a long, slow drag.  CUT TO:  53. EXT.  MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT Barbed wire, armed GUARDS everywhere.  A vehicle waits at the checkpoint; the GUARDS wave it through, and a huge cast-iron GATE rolls into place behind it.  On the gate is a small, tasteful sign which reads "ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER."  54. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT ADRIAN VEIDT walks down a long, greenish corridor flanked by ARMED ESCORT TROOPS.  At the end of the hallway is a foot-thick metal door with a KEYPAD off to one side; one of the TROOPS punches in a six-digit access code, and the door slides back to reveal . . .  . . . another door, this one outfitted with a simple doorbell.  The TROOPS ring the bell, stand rigidly at attention, and wait -- to VEIDT's great amusement.  The inner door slides open.  Peering out is an attractive, big-boned woman in her mid-thirties: LAURIE JUSPECZYK -- aka the SILK SPECTRE.  LAURIE Adrian.  VEIDT Laurie!  Good to see you.  She gives him a warm hug.  The ESCORT TROOPS march back down the hall in perfect lockstep as the giant metal doors ease shut behind them.  LAURIE escorts VEIDT into a huge laboratory space: great oversized machines, blinking computer terminals, advanced scientific paraphernalia of every description.  VEIDT (cont.) Nice.  Who's your decorator -- Edward Teller?  LAURIE Don't rub it in.  I live here.  VEIDT And how's life with the walking H-bomb?  LAURIE He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.  She takes his coat and vanishes into the living quarters.  VEIDT wanders through the lab with an envious eye.  Suddenly he stops.  A SMILE crosses his face as he gazes up at the ceiling:  VEIDT Hi, Jon.  DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.) (a deep, booming voice) Hello, Adrian.  DR. MANHATTAN -- Jon Osterman to his friends -- is a big guy under any circumstances, but at the moment he's downright gargantuan. Forty feet tall, bright blue and buck naked, he's calmly adjusting a calibration atop his particle accelerator.  DR. MANHATTAN (cont.) I think I'm about to detect a gluino.  In case you were wondering, this blue-skinned superman can do just about anything.  He can manipulate matter effortlessly; the physical universe is his plaything.  When it comes to the laws of time and space, DR. MANHATTAN is a chronic offender.  Any government would be glad to have him.  VEIDT Supersymmetrical theory, hmm?  Say, I understand old Schwartzmann caught a decaying proton in that German mineshaft . . .  LAURIE, who's just reappeared, shakes her head and groans.  LAURIE Please, you guys, no shop talk. (to DR. MANHATTAN) Jon, you're being rude.  Why don't you shrivel on down and join us?  DR. MANHATTAN shrugs and shrinks down to a somewhat more manageable six-foot-five.  A pair of BLACK TRUNKS materializes about his waist -- preserving his modesty.  Satisfied, LAURIE turns to VEIDT:  LAURIE (cont.) Good to see you, Adrian.  What's the occasion?  He tosses a casual glance around the lab.  A number of VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted on the walls.  VEIDT . . . Are we being monitored?  DR. MANHATTAN looks at each of the cameras in turn.  One by one, the little red "ON" lights wink out.  DR. MANHATTAN The bearer of bad news.  VEIDT We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.  LAURIE Blake?  Dead?  DR. MANHATTAN Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.  LAURIE shoots an irritated look at DR. MANHATTAN.  This is the first she's heard about it.  VEIDT Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.  DR. MANHATTAN Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.  VEIDT What's your theory?  DR. MANHATTAN Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.  VEIDT peeks at LAURIE, cocks an eyebrow: same old Jon.  But LAURIE is considerably less amused.  LAURIE I could use a drink.  How about you, Adrian?  VEIDT nods yes.  DR. MANHATTAN, meanwhile, has moved off to another part of the lab.  He stands before a vast bank of machinery -- and as we watch, a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and floats off to one side.  A module of circuit boards, chips, and pin connectors slides out of the hole.  Individual components detach themselves and HANG in midair.  DR. MANHATTAN hasn't lifted a finger; he's dismantling and reassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind.  VEIDT has seen these parlor tricks before.  He ambles up and resumes the conversation without missing a beat:  VEIDT I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.  DR. MANHATTAN You mean Afghanistan? (beat) It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.  The module, now fully reconstructed, slides back into place.  The cover panel rises off the floor, settles over the hatch, and screws itself shut.  VEIDT Well . . . I wanted to bring you the news about Blake, but -- as usual -- I can't tell you anything you don't already know.  Goodbye, Jon.  DR. MANHATTAN nods -- just barely.  VEIDT heads for the door, finds his coat where LAURIE put it.  He's just about to leave when she arrives with two stiff drinks in hand.  LAURIE Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --  VEIDT I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.  LAURIE Please.  There's a note of desperation in her voice.  VEIDT glances over his shoulder at DR. MANHATTAN -- who's forty feet tall again, playing with his superaccelerator.  VEIDT He's a little farther gone every time.  LAURIE Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human. (beat) He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.  VEIDT Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.  LAURIE (embarrassed) I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --  VEIDT What about you?  LAURIE I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I. (pause) I'll ring for the guards.  She goes to the steel door, hits a buzzer.  VEIDT watches her, concerned.  She COUGHS, violently, and he reaches into his vest pocket for a cigarette case:  VEIDT Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine. (handing her a cigarette) Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.  LAURIE Maybe I'll do that.  VEIDT I'm sorry about Blake.  He pats her on the shoulder.  The door slides open and the TROOPS appear to escort VEIDT back down the hallway.  LAURIE takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman lover.  He tinkers with his equipment; then, satisfied, he turns and WALKS THROUGH A SOLID BRICK WALL -- as if it weren't there.  CUT TO:  55. EXT. HAPPY HARRY'S - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT A decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood, popular with denizens of the underworld, accessible by a narrow stairway which dips well below street level.  56. INT. HAPPY HARRY'S - NIGHT The usual crowd, living it up.  HOOKERS line the bar.  DRUG DEALERS hover at the entrance to the men's room.  ASSORTED GOONS AND THUGS stand clustered at the pool table, watching a TOPLESS DANCER bump and grind.  Suddenly there's a terrible RACKET, and everyone TURNS.  Over by the entrance, RORSCHACH is hard at work ripping a PAY PHONE off the wall.  Once he has it on the floor, he gives it a couple of vicious licks with a crowbar; then he strides casually over to the bar -- where the proprietor, HAPPY HARRY, is nervously polishing glasses.  RORSCHACH Harry.  HARRY (petrified) R-Rorschach.  RORSCHACH Phone's out of order.  Mind if I use yours?  He reaches under the counter, sets a phone on the bar.  RORSCHACH picks it up and FLINGS IT at a nearby table, scattering the PATRONS and yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall.  He turns and faces the assembled multitudes:  RORSCHACH Edward Blake.  Friend of mine.  Fell through a window.  Might've had help. (wandering through the room) Thought maybe you could fill me in.  ENORMOUS TOUGHS sit riveted to their chairs, staring up in horror as RORSCHACH strolls past.  RORSCHACH (cont.) You.  Gideon.  Whoremonger.  Nothing? (moving on) Johnny Gobs.  What's new at the schoolyard?  Behind RORSCHACH's back, a shadowy figure is slinking furtively toward the exit.  RORSCHACH pivots suddenly, grabs him by the collar, yanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Nicky the Jap.  In a hurry?  You keeping secrets, Nicky?  NICKY sits slumped against the wall, quaking with fear.  RORSCHACH extends a hand to help him up.  He reaches out hesitantly --  -- and RORSCHACH grabs him by the wrist, pulling him off balance.  He closes a gloved fist around NICKY's pinky finger, twists it back and SNAPS IT.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Edward Blake.  Who killed him?  No answer forthcoming.  NICKY lets out a horrible moan as RORSCHACH grabs his index finger and repeats the process.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Who killed Edward Blake?  NICKY passes out.  RORSCHACH releases his grip, lets NICKY sink to the floor, and reaches for his crowbar.  He's standing poised to let fly at NICKY's ribs when a VOICE IN THE CROWD shouts out.  VOICE JESUS!  HE'S IN SHOCK!!  RORSCHACH THE COMEDIAN.  WHO KILLED HIM?  By now HARRY's pulled a sawed-off shotgun from underneath the bar. Without looking up, RORSCHACH spins and HEAVES THE CROWBAR.  It catches HARRY in the jaw, pitching him back into a rack of glassware.  The SHOTGUN discharges TWO HARMLESS BLASTS into the ceiling.  SILENCE in the bar as the ONLOOKERS await RORSCHACH's next move.  He looks at the bleeding HARRY, shakes his head in disgust:  RORSCHACH (cont.) So many vermin . . . so little time.  He bends, pulls a topcoat off NICKY's quivering frame, and tosses it contemptuously at the NUDE DANCER.  Then he turns to go, pausing long enough to HISS at the crowd:  RORSCHACH (cont.) Go back to your heroin and your child pornography.  I'll be around.   CUT TO:  57. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - LIVING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN The bedroom which LAURIE shares with DR. MANHATTAN at the Rockefeller research complex.  It's not quite six A.M., still dark outside, and LAURIE is asleep.  She tosses around under the covers, reaches over to where DR. MANHATTAN should be -- but his side of the bed is empty.  LAURIE (muttering; groggy) Jon . . . ?  A LUMINOUS BLUE HAND enters frame, strokes her cheek gently.  LAURIE closes her eyes and sighs.  DR. MANHATTAN I'm here, Laurie.  LAURIE Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?  DR. MANHATTAN Not yet, there's plenty of time.  A SECOND BLUE HAND strokes her hair.  LAURIE stretches luxuriantly. DR. MANHATTAN kisses her softly on the throat.  LAURIE Mmm.  You feel so good.  Do you have to go?  The BLUE HAND runs down the length of LAURIE's shoulder and arm, toward her hip.  She sighs dreamily.  DR. MANHATTAN Would you like me to stay?  LAURIE Mm hmm.  DR. MANHATTAN I could stay and go.  LAURIE . . . And just how would you manage that?  She leans up to kiss him.  The SECOND BLUE HAND continues its downward progress, almost colliding with a THIRD blue hand, which is massaging LAURIE's thigh.  Third blue hand?  Wait a minute.  LAURIE's eyes go suddenly wide.  She sits bolt upright in bed.  DR. MANHATTAN is stretched out beside her.  He is also sitting at the foot of the bed.  There seem to be two of him.  LAURIE AAAAAAAAAA!!  DR. MANHATTAN I Laurie?  Are you --  DR. MANHATTAN II Don't be upset.  This unique menage a trois proves a bit much for LAURIE's fragile nerves.  She climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a dressing gown.  LAURIE Jon, please.  I don't enjoy these tricks.  Just -- be one person again, please?  The big blue twins stand up, spreading their hands in identical gestures of apology as LAURIE stalks past.  DR. MANHATTAN I Laurie, I did it to please you.  I thought --  DR. MANHATTAN II -- you would find it erotic.  LAURIE All right, all right.  It's just -- my nerves, I'm going stir-crazy in this place, I --  While fumbling in her purse for a cigarette, LAURIE happens to glance through a doorway, into the lab outside.  To her utter astonishment, she sees a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN out there, calmly running an experiment on one of his oversized toys.  She marches angrily through the door . . .  58. INT. LAB - A MOMENT LATER . . . to confront DR. MANHATTAN number three:  LAURIE You've been out here all along, haven't you?  Running one of your stupid experiments --  DR. MANHATTAN III Yes, I thought I could finish up before I leave for Washington.  LAURIE So you sent your, your proxies in there to -- Jon, really, how could you do this?  DR. MANHATTAN III You seem to feel I've been neglecting you.  Isn't that the case? (pause) I thought I'd solved the problem quite elegantly.  LAURIE That's all it is to you, isn't it?  Just another problem you can --  She doesn't see the other two DR. MANHATTANS, who have just entered the room behind her.  They speak in perfect unison:  DR. MANHATTANS I & II Laurie, please --  LAURIE pivots, lets out a little squeal of shock.  She turns back slowly, steadies herself on a lab table.  LAURIE Jon -- just go to Washington, all right?  And take them with you.  I could really use the time alone.  She storms back into the living quarters, past DR. MANHATTANS I & II -- who pop out of existence as soon as she passes.  The original DR. MANHATTAN cocks an eyebrow, sighs, and returns to his equipment.  FADE THROUGH TO:  1. INT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT A pricey joint in midtown.  DREIBERG and LAURIE, well-fed, are hard at work on their second bottle of wine.  She looks amazingly beautiful in full makeup and low-cut evening gown -- but it's largely wasted on her preoccupied date.  At the moment, she's filling him in on life with Dr. Manhattan:  LAURIE The government's really worried.  He gets so flaky sometimes.  I guess it's no picnic being the world's only superhuman. (mock-macho) I have to keep him in line.  She flexes her bicep and holds the pose, waiting for DREIBERG to laugh.  He doesn't.  In fact, he barely even notices; his gaze has wandered off into a far corner of the room.  LAURIE (cont.) Excuse me -- where exactly are you tonight?  DREIBERG Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?  LAURIE Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.  DREIBERG Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .  LAURIE Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.  DREIBERG Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --  Now he's got LAURIE nervous.  She scans the restaurant quickly, then leans forward and speaks, in hushed tones:  LAURIE Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.  DREIBERG (shaking his head in disgust)  Yeah.  That pig Blake gets buried at Arlington, full military honors . . . and I'm still in the psycho file with Rorschach.  LAURIE looks at him a moment.  She starts to chuckle.  DREIBERG (cont.) What's so funny?  Have I got food in my teeth?  LAURIE I'm just wondering what you would've said ten years ago if you could see yourself right now. (raising her glass) Well, here's to the Comedian.  'Cause the fact is, he's dead . . . and we're not.  DREIBERG makes a face -- and smiles despite himself.  1. EXT. ROOFTOP OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE have repaired to the romantic rooftop terrace, which overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  They're holding big snifters of brandy, and they're both pretty well drunk.  DREIBERG The pisser is, nobody ever remembers all the good shit we did.  I mean, we were heroes!  LAURIE Damn straight.  DREIBERG Damn straight!  We were heroes.  LAURIE Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.  DREIBERG Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .  LAURIE (smiling) Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .  DREIBERG Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?  LAURIE That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?  DREIBERG (deadpan) He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.  LAURIE looks aghast for a second and a half.  Then her hand goes to her mouth -- and like DREIBERG she's GIGGLING helplessly.  CAMERA PULLS UP AND AWAY, isolating them on the rooftop, and we hear a stentorian VOICE over scene:  CHAPLAIN (V.O.) In the midst of life we are in death . . .  CUT TO:  59. EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY AN AMERICAN FLAG lies across the coffin of Edward Blake.  CHAPLAIN . . . and so we commend our brother Edward Blake unto God, who shall change our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body --  TIGHT ON DR. MANHATTAN, standing at graveside amid a tight know of mourners.  There's no weeping, no gnashing of teeth;  most of the attendees are bureaucrats or military men, obviously here for reasons of protocol.  Nearby is a cadre of riflemen, ready to send Blake off with the traditional twenty-one gun salute.  CHAPLAIN (cont.) -- according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself.  A light rain begins to fall; umbrellas open all around.  DR. MANHATTAN, of course, doesn't need one -- the raindrops vanish miraculously before they strike him.  CAR HORNS sound in the distance, and he glances off at:  60. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT SENTRIES stand at attention.  They've blocked off the part of the cemetery where the funeral is taking place, but the good Doctor has been spotted nonetheless, and word of his presence is spreading like wildfire.  MOURNERS and TOURISTS are rushing in from every corner of the cemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman.  With all due respect for the dead, Arlington National's turning into a zoo: gawkers are lined up three or four deep.  The sentries have their hands full managing the crowd.  A KID breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to join the excited throng.  As he does, our attention settles on the VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL.  It's not the familiar stark black wall.  It is, bizarrely, a chiseled marble representation of DR. MANHATTAN; his eyes are turned skyward, and he's cradling a WOUNDED AMERICAN GRUNT in his massive arms, Pieta-style.  On the pedestal beneath it, a bronze plaque bears the inscription:  IN MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES TO ACHIEVE VICTORY IN VIETNAM  Below it are the names of the American dead.  There are almost four hundred of them.  61. EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT The Rockefeller Military Research Center -- LAURIE's home sweet home.  Her car pulls up to the guard's booth and he waves her through.  As soon as the chain-link gate rolls back into place behind her, the GUARD picks up a phone and punches in a number.  62. EXT. RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT LAURIE strides up a concrete walkway at the entrance to the complex, fumbling in her purse for a mag-striped ACCESS CARD.  She inserts the card into a slot at the door.  Nothing happens.  She tries again.  Still no luck.  Just then, a long black car pulls up behind her -- and a uniformed officer, MAJOR ADAMSON, steps out.  LAURIE Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.  ADAMSON Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.  LAURIE Why?  What's the problem?  ADAMSON I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.  LAURIE (chuckling) I would like to use the bathroom --  As she speaks, TWO ARMED GUARDS come marching up the walkway.  ADAMSON The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.  LAURIE What?!  ADAMSON Please.  The major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off.  The GUARDS stand at attention, then fall in behind them as they pass.  ADAMSON holds the car door open.  LAURIE's climbing inside when she sees something which turns her confusion into outright panic.  The entrance to the research center has just opened -- and emerging from it, onto the walkway, are a half-dozen men in FULL RADIATION SUITS.  63. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT LAURIE enters with full military escort.  The troops hand her off to a team of DOCTORS and LAB TECHNICIANS, then drop back to stand guard at the door.  A brusque NURSE presents her with a short white gown:  NURSE Miss Juspeczyk.  Put this on, if you would.  LAURIE What -- ?  DOCTOR Drink this.  The DOCTOR hands LAURIE a glass full of iridescent green fluid.  She stares at it, still somewhat nonplussed.  DOCTOR Drink it.  64. INT. MEDICAL LAB - ANTEROOM - NIGHT TECHNICIANS monitor a series of computer screens.  On the screens are shifting, multicolored GRAPHICS PATTERNS representing the interior of a human body as seen from a variety of angles.  A leaded window opens on:  65. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT We're watching what looks like an electronic sarcophagus.  A donut-shaped housing traverses its length repeatedly, head to foot, foot to head, sending a three-dimensional readout telemetrically to the anteroom.  Through a glass panel in the sarcophagus we see LAURIE, he head wedged into a fixed metal brace, eyes darting fitfully left and right as she wonders just what the hell is going on.  66. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT A MAN'S HAND slides a photograph across a table.  LAURIE (O.S.) That's Col. Brent Dabbs.  Jon's military liaison.  LAURIE, still dressed in the white gown, is seated at a table surrounded by GOVERNMENT AGENTS in three-piece suits.  Chief Agent SCHMIDT nods at his cronies and replaces the photo with another taken from a thick sheaf.  LAURIE (cont.) Dr. Candelaria.  He works on one of Jon's research teams.  The quantum-whatever.  SCHMIDT lays a third photo before her.  It's a group shot of the Watchmen -- the same picture that hung in BLAKE's closet.  LAURIE hesitates.  LAURIE (cont.) That's Jon.  Obviously.  And me.  Adrian Veidt. (long pause) Rorschach . . .  SCHMIDT Their real names, please.  LAURIE I don't know their real names.  SCHMIDT You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.  LAURIE I don't know their real names!  SCHMIDT You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give. (holding up the sheaf of photos) These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --  LAURIE Then why don't you ask him?!?  Furious, she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby window.  The AGENTS exhange cool glances.  Like all experienced torturers, they understand the value of patience.  LAURIE (cont.) I want to get dressed.  -- And I'd like a cigarette.  One of the AGENTS pulls a pack from his coat, shakes a cigarette out for LAURIE.  As he's lighting it -- a perfect gentleman -- the door opens and a LAB TECHNICIAN enters with a clipboard.  He passes the clipboard to SCHMIDT, who examines its contents -- and tilts an eyebrow.  LAURIE, looking on, is about to burst with curiosity:  LAURIE (cont.) Someone had better tell me what's going on here!  SCHMIDT Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well. (beat) They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.  LAURIE What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?  All at once, the obvious hits home -- and LAURIE's face goes bone-white.  SCHMIDT nudges the clipboard toward her.  Trembling, she takes it. . .then sets it down, staggered by what she's read.  SCHMIDT I'm terribly sorry.  LAURIE What does this mean?  What does it --  SCHMIDT Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.  LAURIE That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --  She scans the room.  No one's laughing.  SCHMIDT gets up, signals to his comrades, and heads for the door.  SCHMIDT Take a day or two.  If you "remember" any names . . . do give us a call.  The AGENTS leave, and LAURIE sits alone in the office.  She reaches for the clipboard and takes another long hard look.  Then, quaking, she buries her face in her hands.  67. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT A darkened room just off the office; LAURIE is visible through a two-way mirror.  The door opens, and MAJOR ADAMSON -- who's been watching all along -- is joined by SCHMIDT.  ADAMSON Poor kid.  SCHMIDT We'll keep her in isolation awhile.  She'll give us some names.  ADAMSON To hell with those costumed idiots.  I'm worried about Doc Manhattan.  SCHMIDT What do you mean?  ADAMSON She's his last link to humanity.  Once she's gone . . . God knows which way he'll jump.  DISSOLVE TO:  68. INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY DR. MANHATTAN stands in front of a full-length mirror.  He's wearing a navy-blue double-breasted suit, a white shirt, and a maroon necktie with an irregular mauve pattern.  The tie doesn't quite suit him.  His brow wrinkles, and the tie magically transmutes into a more sedate wide-red job with diagonal gold stripes.  Too staid.  DR. MANHATTAN frowns, and the tie transforms itself into a handsome royal-blue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for decoration.  It does nice things for his complexion.  Satisfied, he turns from the mirror, starts for the door, and DEMATERIALIZES.  69. INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY TECHNICIANS running to and fro.  A harried DIRECTOR checks the green room, where the STAFF is beginning to panic.  DIRECTOR We're on the air in five minutes.  Where the hell is that big blue son of a --  He stops, wisely, in mid-sentence.  DR. MANHATTAN has just rematerialized inside the studio, two feet from the DIRECTOR's face.  DR. MANHATTAN I'm sorry.  Am I late?  DIRECTOR No problem.  We'll have to head straight for the set.  -- Oh, I'm Kent Turner, the director. . .  The DIRECTOR shakes DR. MANHATTAN's hand and marches him down a hallway.  Within seconds they're joined by a GOVERNMENT LIAISON.  LIAISON Dr. Osterman.  I've got a list of taboo areas here we'd like you to steer clear of.  Obviously, Afghanistan will come up, but if you'll just play it cool --  DIRECTOR Doc, that blue of yours tends to wash out on camera.  Could you give us something a little darker . . . ?  DR. MANHATTAN pauses briefly.  His skin tone darkens two shades.  DR. MANHATTAN Will this do?  DIRECTOR Perfect.  LIAISON Now Doc, please -- on this Afghanistan thing --  But the good doctor is already at the edge of the set, surrounded by a cluster of SOUND MEN, PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, etc., who are hurriedly prepping him for the telecast.  The frustrated LIAISON hangs back and glances up at an OVERHEAD MONITOR.  The "ABC NEWS SPECIAL REPORT" graphic is already onscreen, with THEME MUSIC underneath.  70. INSERT - TV MONITOR Stock footage.  We open on a shot of terrified Viet Cong racing for their lives through a dense jungle; the camera WHIP PANS to the right and takes in an extraordinary sight.  A towering, ninety-foot tall DR. MANHATTAN strides blithely through the jungle, occasionally directing a blast from his fingertips at the greenery below.  AMERICAN HUEYS hover behind him, spitting out bursts of automatic fire, performing mop-up duty as this one-man defoliation crew does his apocalypse thing.  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads: "VIETNAM.  1965."  ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Dr. Manhattan: the nuclear titan spawned in a freak scientific mishap.  For more than twenty years the "Manhattan Option" has been the linchpin of America's conventional strategy --  We CUT to PRAGUE, where RUSSIAN TANKS are rolling through a broad thoroughfare.  DR. MANHATTAN, only forty feet tall this time, rounds a corner and emerges from behind a municipal building.  His EYES gleam eerily, and the lead tank begins to HEAT UP, the grey gunmetal turning red before our eyes.  The hatch springs open, STEAM hisses, and TERRIFIED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS clamber out -- only to be met with a barrage of ROCKS thrown by the local citizenry.  Title reads: "CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  1968."  ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.) -- in trouble spots from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia to Nicaragua: a one-man cavalry coming to the aid of our democratic allies, holding the Communist menace in check.  DANIEL ORTEGA, in Sandinista drabs, sits at a table across from American Secretary of State G. Gordon Liddy.  The two men shake hands, hold up a signed treaty for the camera.  DR. MANHATTAN, in a three-piece suit, stands behind them, presiding over this historic accord.  Title: "NICARAGUA.  1979."  ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.) In the famous words of General William Westmoreland, "Yes, Virginia, there is a Superman -- and thank God, he's American."  71. INT. SOUNDSTAGE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY A sparse, businesslike talk-show set: two chairs, a table, a backdrop of the Washington monument, and a gallery full of MEDIA PEOPLE.  Jaded news vet DAVID BRINKLEY is manning the host's chair:  BRINKLEY For this live question-and-answer session we'll be joined by correspondents from all three networks.  But since I am moderating, I'll ask you to keep your questions short and snappy. (turning) Now let's welcome our special guest, Jonathan Osterman . . . better known to the world as Dr. Manhattan.  Applause from the crowd.  ANGLE WIDENS to include Doctor M, seated at BRINKLEY's right.  He nods in acknowledgement.  BRINKLEY (cont.) I suppose the topic on everyone's mind this week is Afghanistan, where Russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion.  Now since you've dealt successfully with similar situations in the past . . . I'll ask you point-blank: has the administration requested that you intervene?  DR. MANHATTAN I will not intervene in Afghanistan.  A HUBBUB goes up among the crowd.  72. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON Looking on from offstage.  He rolls his eyes in frustration.  73. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN HANDS are already shooting up among the NEWSMEN in the audience. BRINKLEY ignores them:  BRINKLEY You're saying you would refuse a direct request?  DR. MANHATTAN There will be no request.  I will not intervene.  BRINKLEY Well, Doctor, it's widely understood, or rumored, that you can actually see the future.  Does you answer indicate that the hostilities in Afghanistan will blow over?  74. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON He's steamed, but like everyone else in the studio he's hanging on DR. MANHATTAN's every word.  He turns apprehensively to a COLLEAGUE in the shadows behind him -- and snaps his fingers once:  LIAISON I want a phone line to the booth.  Now.  75. ANGLE ON BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN DR. MANHATTAN I see the future only as it relates to me.  I have no control over it. (long pause) I can only repeat . . . that there will be no request. . .and I will not intervene.  He sits there like a big blue Buddha.  BRINKLEY shrugs and presses on.  BRINKLEY Well, then -- I hope we can take that as an optimistic sign.  I'll open up the floor to questions now.  Doug?  REPORTER Dr. Osterman, I'm Doug Roth of Nova Express.  I'd like to read you some names:  Col. Brent Dabbs, Dr. J. M. Candelaria, Wallace M. Weaver . . . do these names have any meaning to you?  DR. MANHATTAN All friends, yes.  Associates of mine.  ROTH Let me go on.  Stephanie Boris, William Charles Batts, Susan White. Are you aware that these "friends" and "associates" of yours have all been diagnosed with terminal cancer?  The CROWD NOISE begins to build.  Even BRINKLEY's taken aback.  He gapes at DR. MANHATTAN -- who sits there silently, his inhuman face an unreadable mask.  76. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON eyes wide, hand cupped over the in-house telephone  LIAISON Oh Jesus. (barking into phone) I want this broadcast killed.  I'll run out on that goddamn set if I have to!  77. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY, ROTH, DR. MANHATTAN ROTH I have here an official list of sixteen names, all similarly diagnosed.  Now, for the record, Doctor -- is there a connection?  By now, the crowd is about to erupt -- ROTH is shouting to make himself heard over the din.  BRINKLEY, who's just gotten a message from the booth, touches his headset and announces:  BRINKLEY I'm told it's time for a break.  We'll be back after this brief message --  Within seconds the MILITARY LIAISON has rushed out onto the set, flanked by two COLLEAGUES in mirrorshades.  LIAISON THAT DOES IT!  NO MORE QUESTIONS!  SHOW'S OVER!!  The three of them all but yank DR. MANHATTAN out of his seat.  Then, PANDEMONIUM breaks loose as eager NEWSMEN bolt the gallery and MOB THE SET.  RANDOM NEWSMEN Dr. Manhattan!  Are these allegations true?  Do you cause cancer??  DR. MANHATTAN I don't wish to answer any questions.  RANDOM NEWSMEN You see the future!  Did you know in advance --  LIAISON The Doctor will not answer your questions.  Now STEP ASIDE!!  The LIAISON and his boys form a wedge in front of DR. MANHATTAN, but the mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable.  RANDOM NEWSMEN How long have you known -- why is the government concealing this information --  DR. MANHATTAN Please get out of my way.  The LIAISON throws an elbow, knocking a REPORTER to the floor. SCUFFLING breaks out.  Just as it's getting vicious, DR. MANHATTAN lets out a THUNDEROUS SHOUT:  DR. MANHATTAN I said LEAVE ME ALONE!!  In the wink of an eye, the soundstage is EMPTY -- no newsmen, no microphones, no cameras -- nothing but the lone figure of DR. MANHATTAN and, still sitting in the chair behind him, BRINKLEY.  BRINKLEY swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie.  A moment later, there's an ANGRY FLASH of WHITE LIGHT -- and DR. MANHATTAN VANISHES, leaving BRINKLEY alone on the deserted set.  CUT TO:  78. INT. RESEARCH CENTER - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT The place has been pretty well torn apart; MAJOR ADAMSON is overseeing a crew of technicians in white suits as they post quarantine notices at the entrances.  He's not altogether surprised when DR. MANHATTAN rematerializes at his side.  DR. MANHATTAN Where's Laurie?  ADAMSON backs off slightly.  He's not wearing a radiation suit, and he's understandably reluctant to get any closer than absolutely necessary.  ADAMSON She's been relocated, Jon.  It's strictly precautionary . . .  DR. MANHATTAN There's no need to lie.  I assume she's been tested.  Were the results positive?  ADAMSON hesitates the briefest of seconds.  DR. MANHATTAN (cont.) Don't bother.  I already know what you'll say.  He watches impassively as what's left of his home is dismantled.  His mind is already a million miles away.  ADAMSON Jon, I know this is presumptuous, but . . . if you wanted to . . . could you cure her?  DR. MANHATTAN I don't know.  I only know that I won't. (long pause) There'd be no point.  It's finally begun.  ADAMSON "Begun?"  What's begun?  DR. MANHATTAN I've seen this day.  It's the day I've been dreading all these years. (pause) You see, Major Adamson, Laurie Juspeczyk was the only human being I cared for . . .  ADAMSON doesn't know what he's talking about, but a chill runs down his spine nonetheless.  DR. MANHATTAN My work here is finished.  God be with you, Major.  And with that, he VANISHES.  His double-breasted suit he leaves behind; it hangs in midair for a moment, then crumples into a pile at the Major's feet.  ADAMSON Good Lord --  CUT TO:  79. EXT. OUTER SPACE -- and it's about as exterior as you can get.  We're a few hundred miles above Earth; the curvature of the globe is readily apparent from this height, and the surface looks placid and eerily beautiful -- oceans and continents overlaid by a pattern of shifting white clouds.  From frame right, a BLUE FIGURE swings into view, eclipsing our planetary vista and disappearing again off frame left.  It's DR. MANHATTAN.  He's in a lotus position, sitting on nothingness, calmly scanning the globe from his orbital vantage. Stars twinkle behind him as he looks down on the planet he's about to leave, his normally-inscrutable features tinged with regret.  80. EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT Black sky hangs over an empty stretch of desert -- so desolate, so barren and otherworldly that it could pass for Mars.  Could, that is, until we see the residue of man's presence on the landscape: ruined quonset huts, roofless, long since abandoned to the elements, half-buried in drifts of sand; military vehicles, little more than husks now, rusty and gutted; and a sign, dangling awkwardly from a rotted upright -- GILA FLATS TEST BASE.  A gecko skitters across the sand and pauses.  Above it, a sudden RUPTURE appears in the night sky, bathing the sands in blinding blue light.  The gecko runs wildly as DR. MANHATTAN steps through the rift in the sky and descends gently to earth.  The rupture heals itself, and the desert is dark and peaceful once more as DR. MANHATTAN trudges through the sands toward the ghost town of Gila Flats.  He wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was once a canteen: tables are overturned, bottles broken, but the long mahogany bar, though pitted and scarred, stands intact.  A desert rat scurries down its length as DR. MANHATTAN looks on.  We MOVE IN on his emotionless glowing EYES and  DISSOLVE TO:  81. INT. CANTEEN (FLASHBACK) - DAY It's twenty-odd years ago, and we're looking at DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN -- a big, boyish, clean-cut guy of twenty-six, dressed in a necktie and a white lab coat.  He's at a table sipping a mug of beer, wearing a dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion:  JANEY SLATER (O.S.) Nineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor.  You'd think they could at least make us a decent hamburger.  JON laughs, looks sheepishly down at his hands.  He's utterly smitten with DR. JANEY SLATER, his colleague at the test base; she's a couple of years older than he, and pretty, in a heavily-coiffed way -- just close enough to LAURIE that you'd notice the resemblance.  And she's probably the only one in the room who can't see just how bad a crush JON has on her.  JON I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.  JANEY With lots of ketchup?  Smiling, she indicates JON's plate.  He's emptied at least half a bottle on his french fries.  JON Nothing wrong with ketchup.  JANEY Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?  JON Anything for science, I guess. (long, hesitant pause) Janey, there's something --  JANEY (simultaneously) We should get back -- (realizing she's cut him off) What?  JON Nothing.  What were you going to say?  JANEY We should get back to the lab. (staring at him; chuckling) You okay, Jon?  He stares at his hands, afraid to meet her eyes.  After a moment he pipes up:  JON Oh, yeah.  You go ahead.  I'll be right behind you.  The lad seems a little screwy today.  JANEY shrugs, gets up and heads for the door.  JON takes a moment to collect himself, then looks after JANEY.  She's paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch.  His face goes a little pale.  He screws up his courage, rushes up behind her.  JANEY Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --  JON (blurting it out) Janey, will you marry me?  She turns and looks him squarely in the face.  He's wearing the pained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the verdict.  JANEY Jon -- what?  JON swallows hard, and the two of them stare at each other, eyes locked.  For a moment it's as if they're the only souls in the canteen.  But just then two SCIENTISTS come bustling through the door, clipboards in hand, deep in a conversation of their own; and one of them -- DR. WALLY WEAVER -- walks smack into the startled JANEY, causing her to drop her wristwatch.  There's a loud CRUNCH.  JON and JANEY snap out of their private trance as WALLY bends to retrieve the watch.  WALLY Christ, Janey, I think I stepped on your watch.  JANEY Oh Wally, don't feel bad.  It was cheap, it never worked anyway --  JON I can fix it.  JANEY -- What?  JON My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.  He holds out his hand.  Their eyes meet for a long moment.  WALLY Take him up on it.  It'd make me feel better.  Chuckling, WALLY and his colleague head off to find a table.  JANEY hands JON the watch; his hands close around her, and he gazes at her with basset-hound eyes.  She realizes he's still waiting for his answer.  But before she can speak, JON produces a small BOX from his pocket. He thrusts it abruptly into JANEY's hands --  JON Here.  I'll trade you.  -- and hustles off.  She opens the box, finds an ENGAGEMENT RING. With a little smile she tries it on, and turns to show JON -- but he's already gone.  She stares at the ring.  Her smile broadens.  82. INT. LABORATORY - DAY JON's at a lab table, papers stacked all around him.  In the center of the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with JEWELER'S TOOLS.  It's his lunch hour, and he's fixing JANEY's watch.  He tightens the central screw which holds the hands in place, then fits the crystal into its housing and gives it a light tap.  With a big, childlike grin of satisfaction -- the boy's in love, remember -- he gets up and starts for the door.  The lab is jammed with oversized, arcane machinery; the centerpiece is a concrete TEST CHAMBER with two-foot-thick metal walls.  Mounted on either side of it are PARTICLE CANNONS -- great bulky devices which look like anti-aircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils.  He stops, spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner, and walks over to grab it.  As he's putting it on, he hears a tiny SQUEAK from the direction of the test chamber.  Mounted above the chamber is a DIGITAL CLOCK -- hours, minutes, seconds, tenths of seconds.  Just now it's 13:58 and change.  JON eyes the clock, hesitates briefly, then grabs a broom and steps to the reinforced steel door of the chamber.  Inside, the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a low platform -- and a MOUSE, which scurries into the corner when it hears JON coming.  He steps inside, sets JANEY's watch on the concrete block, and swings the broom at the mouse.  JON C'mon, little guy, outta here . . .  The mouse legs it out the door.  JON follows, smiling, broom in hand.  JON (cont.) . . . don't wanna screw up a million-dollar experiment.  He stops.  Feels around in his pocket.  Realizes he's left the watch inside.  He looks at the overhead clock again -- 13:59:30 and counting. Agitated now, he races back toward the chamber, pauses in the doorway, spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of the concrete block.  He dashes inside, circles around the concrete block, reaches for the watch --  -- and FREEZES at the sound of THREE WARNING BEEPS behind him.  White-faced, he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete block -- too quickly.  He nicks his shin on the projecting edge of the support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber.  Before his eyes, a MASSIVE STEEL DOOR is sliding into place -- TRAPPING HIM INSIDE.  He LURCHES toward the door, gets a hand through.  The door keeps sliding.  He jerks his hand back a half-second before the door slams shut.  83. INT. LAB - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT 1300 hours sharp.  A half-dozen SCIENTISTS stroll into the lab.  One of them is passing out goggles -- to his colleagues and a pair of MILITARY BIGWIGS who are obviously on a walking tour of the facilities.  SCIENTIST -- actually, we don't know what happens when you disrupt the intrinsic field.  All we've managed to do so far is blow a few concrete blocks all to hell.  GENERAL (joking, but worried) No danger of . . . fallout, is there?  SCIENTIST No sir.  The chamber's radiation-proof once it's sealed.  That's why we waited outside.  The translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a dull red.  The crowd draws closer, goggles in place.  There's a dim, distant THUMPING.  The SCIENTISTS look at the chamber -- and go slackjawed in perfect unison.  GENERAL What's the matter?  SCIENTIST Sweet Jesus -- !  We DOLLY IN rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of the test chamber -- leaded glass, two feet thick.  Behind it is the terrified face of JON OSTERMAN -- pounding frantically on the glass, screaming soundlessly.  Pandemonium in the lab as the SCIENTISTS rush right and left, punching buttons, twisting knobs -- to no avail.  The GENERAL comes to a belated and painfully obvious realization:  GENERAL Say, there's a man in there!!  The coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow.  One SCIENTIST stands at the observation window and SHOUTS --  SCIENTIST I Stay calm, Jon!  We'll try and kill the power!  -- while another barks furiously into a wall phone:  SCIENTIST II Building six!  Kill the power!  Osterman's trapped in the I.F. chamber!!  The GENERAL stands there looking rather nonplussed.  GENERAL Well -- why doesn't someone let him out??  SCIENTIST III It's a timelock.  It can't be opened once the sequence starts. (to SCIENTIST II) What's the word?  SCIENTIST II (covering the phone) They're sending a crew to the generator building --  SCIENTIST IV TWENTY SECONDS!  In a glass box on the wall is a fire ax -- with the instructions "IN CASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS."  WALLY WEAVER, Jon's friend from the canteen, wraps his lab coat around his forearm, punches through the glass, and grabs the ax.  SCIENTIST I Wally!  What are you doing?  WALLY The power cables!!  And now another figure enters the lab -- the unsuspecting JANEY SLATER.  JANEY Am I late for the --  She stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the lab.  SCIENTIST III spots her, grabs her, tries to push her back through the door.  SCIENTIST III Janey!  Get her out of here.  Get out!  But she resists.  She's just spotted WALLY with his ax, poised to take a swing at a thick black cable on the floor.  The cannon coils have just gone from yellow to a brilliant, luminous white.  JANEY What in the name of -- where's Jon?  SCIENTIST III Janey!  Please!  Go!!  WALLY strikes at the cable.  Nothing.  He takes another whack, and a sudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a wall.  Sparks fly, but the process continues.  The room is full of white light.  JANEY, fighting her way past the SCIENTIST, gets a good look at the observation panel -- and the blood drains from her face.  JANEY Jon.  84. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT JON backs away from the glass panel, a look of disbelief on his face.  He blinks; his hands fall limply at his sides; the watch, which he's been holding all along, falls on the floor and shatters . . .  . . . and everything in the room goes blue.  85. INT. LAB - THAT MOMENT The SCIENTISTS slowly cluster around the observation panel, unable to tear their eyes away.  JANEY, past hope, wanders up unsteadily behind them.  JANEY Jon . . . (shrieking) JON!!!  86. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT JON's back is arched.  His arms go up.  His face is a mask of unbelievable agony.  A moment later, his skin is gone.  A black skeleton -- like a photographic negative -- stands in his place.  Then the skeleton BURSTS. . . into its constituent atoms.  The iridescent blue light has quite literally taken Jon Osterman to pieces.  And then, the test chamber is empty.  The blue light begins to dim, and we're looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of the SCIENTISTS.  One by one, they back away . . . leaving only JANEY, who gazes into the chamber with a blank, soulless stare.  DISSOLVE TO:  87. INT. RUINED CANTEEN (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT The desert rat chitters on the bar.  On the partially collapsed wall behind it hangs a broken clock, which stopped some twenty years ago at 11:48 PM.  For a moment DR. MANHATTAN, even more abstracted than usual, watches the rat.  Then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the door of the canteen.  88. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT DR. MANHATTAN walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound.  89. INT. MEN'S ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT TWO SCIENTISTS washing their hands at the sinks.  They glance up into the mirror simultaneously, and BLANCH.  Behind them, a hideous thing is coalescing in midair -- a brain, eyes, a dangling spinal cord, wriggling neurons -- a gruesome, disembodied central nervous system.  They pivot, shrieking, just in time to see the creature evaporate in a haze of shimmering blue light.  90. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.  91. EXT. TEST BASE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT HORRIFIED SENTRIES fire their rifles, then turn and run.  A partially-muscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and SCREAMS for several seconds before vanishing altogether.  92. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.  93. INT. GILA FLATS MESS HALL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT Dinnertime.  JANEY and WALLY at a table.  JANEY I can't help it.  I'm going to quit this place.  It feels . . . it feels haunted.  WALLY It'll be all right, Janey.  You need time, that's all. (tugging at his ear) Do you hear some kind of -- whistling?  Indeed she does, and within moments it builds to a deafening whine. Odder yet, WALLY's hair is standing on end -- and so is JANEY's. Everyone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish phenomenon.  UTENSILS rise from tables and drift magically into the air.  Without warning, the overhead lights blow out -- and a BRILLIANT BLUE GLOW suffuses the room.  All eyes turn toward the source of the glow . . .  . . . the fully formed figure of DR. MANHATTAN, floating above them, nude, hands spread like some majestic blue messiah.  Metal trays and utensils hover in midair around him, throwing off sparks.  JANEY gapes at his face.  She recognizes it instantly.  Her hands go to her mouth and she lets out a horrible, endless shriek.  JANEY JON-N-N-N!!!  DISSOLVE TO:  94. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT THE SHRIEK DIES as DR. MANHATTAN stares up into space.  He turns, stares at the ground.  Nothing but sand.  He stoops nonetheless and begins to dig.  A couple of inches down, he finds what he's looking for: an ancient, tattered photograph, faded almost beyond recognition.  Young Jon, and Janey Slater.  She's holding up her hand, showing off her brand-new engagement ring.  His fist close around the snapshot.  His eyes slowly shut.  95. SERIES OF SHOTS Quick, almost subliminal visions of the past and future:  -- JON's black skeleton, bursting to atoms in the test chamber;  -- JANEY shrieking in the mess hall, her face bathed in blue light;  -- LAURIE at a breakfast table, drinking coffee, reading the paper. There's a sudden flash of light; the windows shatter inward; a terrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones . . .  -- A CITY demolished by a nuclear blast, the inevitable mushroom cloud rising swiftly, blotting out the sky.  96. EXT. DESERT - ON DR. MANHATTAN Fists still clenched, he stands -- grimacing, distraught, alone in the ghostly calm of the desert.  He rises into the air, slowly at first, then faster . . . finally disappearing in a sudden blue starburst a mile above the ground.  97. EXT. OUTER SPACE All at once, we're back in the starry void, hurtling away from Earth at unimagined speeds . . . through empty space, past the moon, on toward Mars.  The red planet looms larger and larger, finally dominating the frame as we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the Martian surface. Individual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct: vast canyons, oceans of fog, volcanoes the size of Missouri. Herschel's famous canali.  And finally, the argyre planitia, an enormous shallow crater, its rocky rim encircling two jutting blue mountains and, to the south, a ragged, semicircular ridge.  Two eyes, a big broad smile.  It looks uncannily like a happy-face.  Many miles below us, a tiny rupture opens in the Martian atmosphere.  BLUE LIGHT spills out an instant before we  CUT TO:  98. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN The late news, with highlights of DR. MANHATTAN's press conference. As the throng of REPORTERS shove microphones at him, we ZOOM IN on his angered face:  DR. MANHATTAN I said leave me alone!!  Then there's a sudden CUT.  We see the same REPORTERS, in the same positions, only DR. MANHATTAN is gone -- and they're all standing on the White House lawn, in the midst of a torrential downpour.  PULL BACK TO:  99. INT. ROOM - GOVT. SECURITY COMPLEX - NIGHT A restless LAURIE watching the broadcast from an overstuffed chair. She's in a big open room with a bed and kitchenette; except for the big metal door and the bars on the windows, it could pass for a comfy furnished studio.  TV ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.) -- in Washington, where an irate Dr. Manhattan teleported a crew of reporters into the midst of a rainstorm on Pennsylvania Avenue!  TV ANCHORMAN (O.S.) Well, Katie, I know some politicians who'd like to learn that trick --  LAURIE turns at the sound of keys in the door.  A moment later, SCHMIDT enters, followed by a pair of FEDERAL AGENTS.  SCHMIDT All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.  LAURIE Am I free to go?  SCHMIDT You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.  LAURIE (fed up; exploding) I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --  SCHMIDT Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.  LAURIE Jon??  You mean he's --  SCHMIDT That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.  CUT TO:  100. EXT. NEWSTAND - DAY The same headlines scream from every edition on the rack:  DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH Russian Tanks Advance President Vows "Maximum Force" WHERE IS DR. MANHATTAN?  And on the street, tensions are running high.  The familiar NEWS VENDOR is engaged in a heated exchange with one of his CUSTOMERS:  NEWS VENDOR I'll tell you what the problem is.  We shoulda been building tanks, bombs, ICBM's!  Instead we been relying on that big blue son of a bitch --  CUSTOMER Anyone ever tell you you're full of shit?  NEWS VENDOR Kiss my ass, buddy!  Keep your goddamn quarter!  VOICE New Frontiersman, please.  The NEWS VENDOR turns suddenly, finds himself confronted by an old friend: the red-haired STREET CRAZY with the end-of-the-world sign. He rolls his eyes -- this is all I need -- and reaches under the counter.  NEWS VENDOR Here you go, pal.  Two bucks. (beat) Well, I see the world ain't ended yet.  The STREET CRAZY eyes the lurid cover of his magazine.  "EXPOSED: RED PLOT TO FRAME DR. MANHATTAN!"  STREET CRAZY . . . How do you know?  CUT TO:  101. EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT A row of decayed walk-ups in a fringe neighborhood downtown.  A DRUNKEN COUPLE -- a gaunt, middle-aged MAN and a blowsy, overweight WOMAN -- totter down the street arm in arm.  NEON SIGNS blink on and off as they mount the front steps of a seedy building, exchanging tipsy giggles.  102. INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT A three-room hellhole, decor by Goodwill.  A door opens, and the MAN ushers his date inside with exaggerated formality.  Her name is LUCY; his is Edgar William Jacobi, but -- for reasons soon to be revealed -- we'll call him MOLOCH.  MOLOCH Now.  What was milady drinking?  LUCY Gin.  Straight up -- (mock-ladylike)  -- with a little twist of lime.  She laughs convulsively, as if she's just told the world's funniest joke.  MOLOCH lifts a single finger and starts toward the kitchen:  MOLOCH I think I can oblige.  103. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT MOLOCH FREEZES in the doorway, his face taut with apprehension.  The contents of his refrigerator have been strewn all over the kitchen floor -- overturns milk cartons, broken eggs, the like.  It's a disaster area.  As he steps inside to investigate, LUCY appears in the doorway behind him -- and SNORTS.  LUCY Jeez, honey!  You got some kind of animal in here?  On cue, the refrigerator door KICKS OPEN -- and out pops RORSCHACH. He grabs MOLOCH by the lapels, pins him back against the kitchen table.  RORSCHACH Moloch.  Did you miss me?  LUCY Willie!  Jesus!  What's going on?  RORSCHACH (glancing up) Who's the welfare mother?  MOLOCH I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.  RORSCHACH Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.  MOLOCH You're making a big --  RORSCHACH lifts MOLOCH up slightly, then slams him down hard against the table -- repeatedly, to the beat.  RORSCHACH Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.  MOLOCH ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?  LUCY Willie, what's he talking about?  RORSCHACH backs off, allowing MOLOCH to slump to the floor. RORSCHACH kneels beside him.  MOLOCH Look, I don't know what you want, but I been a private citizen for ten years.  I --  RORSCHACH cups one gloved hand under MOLOCH's chin and pulls him close.  Then, for LUCY's benefit, he explains:  RORSCHACH Turned state's witness in '75.  Earned himself a brand-new face. (twisting MOLOCH's head to one side, for a better look) Hnnrh.  Butt-ugly then . . . butt-ugly now.  He shoves MOLOCH back onto the floor, then stands.  There's a sugar bowl on the table; RORSCHACH spots it and pockets a few cubes as MOLOCH gets up to dust himself off.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Comedian dead.  Dr. Manhattan in exile.  Obvious connection.  Who's behind it?  MOLOCH Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --  RORSCHACH Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.  MOLOCH CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --  RORSCHACH Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.  LUCY, still unsettled, crosses to MOLOCH's side and grips his arm as RORSCHACH opens a rear window.  He's climbing through the frame when he stops suddenly and points a finger at the frightened pair:  RORSCHACH (cont.) Word of advice for the lady . . . stock up on penicillin.  -- and he's out on the fire escape and GONE.  LUCY looks suspiciously at MOLOCH, who shrugs, embarrassed: I don't know what he's talking about.  CUT TO:  104. INT. PENTAGON - WAR ROOM - DAY The familiar set from Dr. Strangelove: top brass seated at a big round table, with a huge Mercator-projection map of the world looming in BG.  The Afghan-Pakistani border is highlighted in red; a MILITARY ANALYST paces in front of the big board with a penlight POINTER, highlighting areas of strategic importance.  ANALYST Our projections show Pakistan falling within the week.  From there it's sixty percent certain they'll try to take Western Europe.  GENERAL Respectfully, sir, out NATO allies are getting itchy.  They're quizzing us about the possibility of a first strike.  MOVE IN on a tall chair at the head of the table -- the back of which bears the seal of the President of the United States.  PRESIDENT First strike. (long pause) I'd like to view the simulation.  The ANALYST hits a button on a remote control device.  ANALYST Optimally . . . we could expect to wipe out some eighty percent of their retaliatory capability before they knew what hit 'em.  On the big board, BLUE ARROWS emanate from selected points in the Pacific and the Arctic Circle and veer toward Russian turf -- blossoming in yellow-and-black RADIATION SYMBOLS as they strike their targets.  PRESIDENT What about our end?  ANALYST Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.  On the board, RED ARROWS inch westward from Mother Russia.  ANALYST (cont.) Britain down -- Germany down --  PRESIDENT What kind of time frame are we talking about?  ANALYST Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.  RADIATION SYMBOLS sprout over New York, Baltimore, Washington, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco.  PRESIDENT . . . Of course.  By now, both coasts are pretty well blotted out.  The ANALYST, a dedicated optimist, turns to announce:  ANALYST As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.  PRESIDENT What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?  ANALYST We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.  PRESIDENT The weather.  I see. (pause) Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.  The SECRETARY OF STATE -- our old pal G. Gordon Liddy -- pipes up:  SECRETARY LIDDY Dick, before we act hastily, we should consider . . . Dr. Manhattan may decide to return.  With a heavy heart, the Chief Executive pushes himself away from the table -- and we get our first good look at him.  His face is lined and tired, his hair is flecked with white, but he's none other than that beloved statesman RICHARD M. NIXON -- still vital and robust at 74.  PRESIDENT (cont.) Good God.  At times like this I wish I'd never come out of retirement.  CUT TO:  105. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY A private practice in midtown Manhattan.  LAURIE emerges from an examination room, grim and hollow-eyed; the DOCTOR hangs back in the doorway.  DOCTOR I'm sorry, Miss Juspecyzk.  LAURIE Not at all, Doctor.  I appreciate your honesty.  106. INT. GUNGA DINER - DUSK A greasy Indian restaurant in a Village storefront.  In a booth near the entrance we find LAURIE and DREIBERG munching on chicken tandoori.  DREIBERG Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . . (pause) How about you, Laurie?  LAURIE (lying -- with forced cheer) Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out. (shrugging) No expense account.  No place to live.  DREIBERG You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each other, someone might put two and two together . . .  LAURIE shakes her head and laughs -- mirthlessly.  LAURIE They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.  DREIBERG Maybe not, but why take chances?  LAURIE Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --  -- and she's dying of cancer.  The irony of it hits home, throws a damper on her little burst of optimism.  Depressed again, she starts to get up.  LAURIE I'm just running on, Dan.  Thanks for dinner.  I'd better go find myself a cheap room.  DREIBERG watches on, paralyzed by indecision, as LAURIE heads for the door of the restaurant.  Then, submitting to impulse, he gets up and chases her down:  DREIBERG Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --  DREIBERG No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.  LAURIE You're sure?  He nods.  She smiles and takes his arm as they walk out of the restaurant.  THROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby booth we watch them passing on the street outside.  The OCCUPANT of the booth, whose face is out of frame, fidgets restlessly with a menu and a squeeze bottle of ketchup.  He inverts the ketchup over the menu, squirts out an upside-down question mark, then closes the menu and mashes it shut.  When he opens it again, he's got a makeshift RORSCHACH BLOT.  107. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GUNGA DINER - SUNSET A SHORT-ORDER COOK empties garbage into a can outside the restaurant, then disappears inside.  Two beats later, a DARK SILHOUETTE strolls casually down the alleyway.  He moves a garbage can, finds a sheet of plywood tacked to the crumbling brick wall behind it.  He pries the plywood loose, finds a small recess in the wall, then extracts a SLOUCH HAT . . . and a shifting INKBLOT MASK.  108. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The guest bedroom is furnished in a somewhat grandmotherly style: flowered wallpaper, an old brass bed with a frilly comforter, etc. It's small but cozy, and LAURIE lets out an appreciative "aah" as DREIBERG ushers her in.  LAURIE This is so nice of you, Daniel.  I really do appreciate it.  DREIBERG's lugging her suitcases.  He sets them on the bed and stands there for a moment, looking vaguely expectant.  LAURIE (cont.) Are you . . . waiting for a tip?  DREIBERG Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --  LAURIE I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?  She gives him a sisterly peck on the cheek, then returns to her unpacking.  DREIBERG watches her for a second, then turns to go.  109. INT. HALLWAY - ON DREIBERG As he closes the door, he get a quick glimpse, from behind, of LAURIE unbuttoning her shirt.  He quickly averts his gaze and pulls the door shut.  110. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - NIGHT DREIBERG, in pajamas, climbs into bed and kills the light.  He folds his hands behind his head and stares up at the ceiling.  111. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE Another quick glimpse of derring-do.  This time it's SILK SPECTRE -- LAURIE -- in the midst of a gang of thugs.  She fights them off valiantly, but she's heavily outnumbered.  She turns and runs.  An oblong shadow falls across the ground, and NIGHT OWL swings into frame; he's clinging to a rope ladder which hangs from his AIRSHIP overhead.  In one smooth motion he swoops into LAURIE's path and snatches her into the air, safe from the clutches of her pursuers.  112. INT. BEDROOM - ON DREIBERG. His head turns at the sound of WATER running in the bathroom adjacent.  He's going to be awake half the night thinking of LAURIE.  CUT TO:  113. EXT. STREET - DAY Early morning.  Across the street from us is a BUBBLE CAR parked in an alley.  Its occupants: MOLOCH, and a straitlaced guy in a suit and crewcut.  He's got a definite CTU look about him.  MOLOCH gets out, scans the street, and crosses toward the GUNGA DINER.  114. INT. GUNGA DINER - REST ROOM - A MOMENT LATER A twitchy MOLOCH locks himself in a stall, sits on the throne, and pulls out a bundle of WHITE POWDER.  He takes a couple of hits up the nose, then dips his finger in the stuff and rubs it around the edges of his EYELIDS.  His eyes water.  He sniffles.  He reaches for some toilet paper; bizarrely, a small BUSINESS CARD falls out of the roll.  He picks it up . . .  There's a hand-scrawled RORSCHACH BLOT on its face.  A low, hissing GROWL from overhead.  MOLOCH looks up suddenly -- and sees RORSCHACH peering at him over the stall partition.  He GASPS and lunges for the door.  RORSCHACH's arm snakes out and holds the stall door shut.  RORSCHACH Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.  MOLOCH No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.  A long pause.  RORSCHACH GROWLS again: let's have it.  MOLOCH (cont.) There's a big bunch of research scientists -- missing.  Blake was on a case, trying to track 'em down. (beat) It's big, Rorschach.  Something to do with Doc Manhattan.  That's all I've been able to find out.  RORSCHACH Drug habit.  Highly illegal.  Hnrrh. (snarling) Let it go time.  In future -- just say no.  With that he disappears over the edge of the stall.  MOLOCH sits there a moment.  He reaches for the stall door, rattles it.  It won't open.  MOLOCH HEY!!  RORSCHACH's stuck a broomstick through the door handles on the adjacent stalls. As MOLOCH POUNDS on the door in frustration, we  CUT TO:  115. INT. VEIDT'S PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY A plush RECEPTION ROOM in his Veidt Industries pyramid; it's decorated in the same Egyptian motifs as his office.  VEIDT sits in an overstuffed chair, surrounded by VIDEO CAMERAS; he's in the process of charming JUSTINE JAMES, a fawning Barbara Walters-figure who's prepping a segment for her next celebrity-chat special.  JUSTINE Now Adrian, I guess there's one thing everyone wants to know. Are you the world's smartest man?  VEIDT Oh my, yes.  And the best-dressed.  A round of chuckles from the video CREW.  Wotta smoothie!  JUSTINE You're certainly one of the richest.  Holder of over forty basic patents -- including products that have changed our everyday lives. (pause) If you had one achievement you were proudest of -- what would that be?  VEIDT ponders for a second, then reaches into his jacket and pulls out his gold cigarette case.  VEIDT Sphinx brand. (opening the case) When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it? (lighting up) In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?  JUSTINE Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --  VEIDT (bristling) No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.  JUSTINE Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.  VEIDT No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --  VEIDT is interrupted by a GROWLING NOISE from his office adjacent. He glances quickly over his shoulder, then gets back to business.  VEIDT (cont.) -- we agreed specifically --  MORE GROWLING from the next room over.  The CAMERA CREW's getting curious.  VEIDT gets up from his chair.  VEIDT (cont.) Excuse me a second.  He goes to the office door and slips inside.  The usually-smiley JUSTINE shoots a look of disgust at her CREW: what a prick.  116. INT. VEIDT'S OFFICE - DAY VEIDT is shocked to find RORSCHACH down on the carpet, wrestling with his mutant LYNX.  He CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE:  VEIDT KITTY!!  One last nip, and the cat backs off.  RORSCHACH gets to his feet -- no visible signs of damage, except for a severe bruise to his dignity.  VEIDT (cont.) How the hell did you get in here?  The curtains are flapping; a BREEZE hits VEIDT across the face.  He looks up, sees a NEAT ROUND HOLE cut out of his plate-glass window.  RORSCHACH New information.  VEIDT (pointing to the telephone) Ever see one of these before?  RORSCHACH Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.  VEIDT What is that ungodly smell?  RORSCHACH, abashed, lets out a timid version of his trademark HISS.  RORSCHACH Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .  VEIDT Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now. (beat) And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.  RORSCHACH Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.  He makes for the window.  VEIDT frowns, adjusts his tie and exits.  CUT TO:  117. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE cooking dinner.  DREIBERG burns his fingers on a broiling pan, which prompts a sudden round of stamping and cursing.  LAURIE watches for a minute, then shakes her head.  She pours a full glass of wine and thrusts it at him.  LAURIE Daniel -- drink this.  Immediately. (smiling) I swear, you are acting like a kid on a date.  Sucking on his burnt fingers, he reluctantly takes the wineglass.  DREIBERG Okay, I'm nervous.  It's an odd sensation.  I've always had to think of you as Dr. Manhattan's --  He catches himself -- too late.  LAURIE glowers at him.  LAURIE His what?  DREIBERG His . . . whatever.  LAURIE I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?  She spears a couple of steaks, drops them on plates, and heads toward the dining room.  LAURIE Look, I just want to eat dinner and get drunk.  Let's not make it any more difficult than we have to, huh?  118. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN The latest bad news from half a world away:  NEWS ANCHOR Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, the fighting continues to escalate . . .  On a televised MAP of Afghanistan, RED RUSSIAN ARROWS are working their way slowly but inexorably toward Pakistani territory.  NEWS ANCHOR (cont.) With Russian forces approaching the border, Pakistan today called on the US to intervene.  President Nixon has placed America's European military installations on full alert --  CAMERA PULLS BACK, placing us in --  119. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT A DINING ROOM TABLE littered with crumpled napkins and dirty dishes.  DREIBERG and LAURIE have just finished dinner.  He stares in dismay at the TV screen as he opens a fresh bottle of wine.  DREIBERG Good Lord.  With Jon out of the picture it's a whole new ball game.  LAURIE's already a little tipsy, and the broadcast doesn't much interest her.  Wine glass in hand, she's wandered over to the stereo cabinet.  LAURIE That's right, Daniel.  A whole new ball game. (smiling) God!  I haven't seen on of these in fifteen years.  She's referring to DREIBERG's ancient TURNTABLE.  Shelved beneath it are row upon row of LP's -- these days, they're obsolete collector's items.  DREIBERG I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.  LAURIE I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago. (flipping through records) Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.  DREIBERG Play one.  Educate yourself.  LAURIE chuckles.  Her head turns at the sound of a familiar COMMERCIAL THEME.  On the TV, a young woman sits at her vanity and gazes lovingly at a WEDDING PICTURE framed in silver.  LAURIE Oh look.  It's Adrian's ad.  TV CHORUS "Oh my darling, it's incredible, That someone so unforgettable . . ."  120. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT MOLOCH's apartment.  THE SAME COMMERCIAL is blaring from the TV as RORSCHACH lets himself in.  TV CHORUS ". . . Should think I am unforgettable too."  RORSCHACH Moloch?  No reply from MOLOCH, who sits in an easy chair, his back to camera, seemingly glued to the tube.  RORSCHACH casts a cautious glance around the room and advances stealthily toward the chair.  Onscreen, the WOMAN at the vanity opens a jar and smear LIME-GREEN GOO on her face:  TV ANNOUNCER The years melt away with NOSTALGIA.  Use it once a week -- and wrinkles vanish overnight.  Medically tested, non-habit-forming NOSTALGIA is the patented beauty cream that actually reverses the aging process . . .  RORSCHACH Moloch?  He creeps up behind MOLOCH, lays a hand on his shoulder.  121. REVERSE ANGLE - ON MOLOCH staring at the TV screen with sightless eyes.  There's a NEAT ROUND BULLET-HOLE in the center of his forehead.  RORSCHACH sees it and spins on his heels, anticipating an ambush --  TV ANNOUNCER (O.S.) For the smooth young face he'll never forget --  122. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT LAURIE is still flipping through records.  DREIBERG chuckles at the TV ad.  TV ANNOUNCER -- turn back the clock with NOSTALGIA . . . from Veidt Industries.  DREIBERG No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?  LAURIE Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!  DREIBERG I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?  LAURIE I like the way you look. (beat) It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .  DREIBERG Old?  LAURIE Not at all.  You look very -- dashing. (standing up) Here, you pick one.  DREIBERG . . . What?  LAURIE Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.  Her tone is unmistakably flirtatious.  DREIBERG hesitates -- then, with a noncommittal smile, he moves to the record cabinet.  123. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT RORSCHACH making a hasty exit.  An AMPLIFIED VOICE booms out:  LOUDSPEAKER RORSCHACH!  THIS IS THE CIVIL TERRORISM UNIT.  YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO COME OUT.  He goes to the window and peeks through the blinds.  On the street outside, BUBBLE CARS are massing, blocking off the intersection.  A CTU SWAT TEAM prepares to raid the building.  LOUDSPEAKER YOU WON'T BE HARMED.  COME OUT.  IT'S ALL OVER!  He's walked into a trap.  As he lets the blinds fall, ALL SOUND DIES -- and a bouncy, tinkling PIANO THEME comes up underneath.  124. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The PIANO MUSIC emanates from DREIBERG's stereo: an old Fats Waller tune, "S'posin'."  He's slow dancing with LAURIE, their faces illuminated by the cold blue flicker of the television.  With a smile she reaches up to remove his glasses, then deposits them in his shirt pocket.  Dreamily, she rests her hand on his shoulder.  Her nearness is making him nervous.  She pauses in mid-step and takes his face in her hands.  He tries to look away, but she pulls his face around -- so that he can't avoid her gaze any longer -- and plants a soft kiss on his mouth.  The PIANO INTRO ends, and Fats' teasing vocal begins:  "S'posin' I should fall in love with you . . . Do you think that you could love me too . . ."  125. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS) SONG CONTINUES UNDERNEATH, cheerful soundtrack accompaniment to a horrific silent movie.  RORSCHACH races out of the bathroom carrying a plastic MOP BUCKET, plus an armload of bottles and aerosol cans -- ordinary household supplies.  He enters the kitchen, rummages around under the sink, finds another handful of bottles: cleaning fluid, rubbing alcohol, Drano.  Almost as an afterthough he moves to the gas stove, turns on all the burners -- and BLOWS OUT THE FLAMES.  "S'posin' I should hug you and caress you . . . Would it impress you . . ."  126. INT. TENEMENT - FRONT STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS) A contingent of ARMED CTU MEN rushing silently up the stairs.  "Or would it distress you?  Hmm?"  127. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT (MOS) RORSCHACH dousing the living room carpet with charcoal lighter and rubbing alcohol.  There's a pile of bottles -- only half-emptied -- resting next to the front door.  The CTU COPS are pounding on the front door, trying to break it down.  RORSCHACH crouches in the hallway just outside the living room.  The door finally gives way, and the COPS tumble in.  RORSCHACH strikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an AEROSOL CAN -- creating a minature FLAMETHROWER.  The COPS heads swivel just as the puddle on the carpet catches -- and a moment later, the PILE OF BOTTLES EXPLODES, engulfing the doorway in flame.  "S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . . (Yeah I yearn.  Sure I do.) Would you think I'm speaking out of turn? . . ."  128. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE horizontal on the sofa, their clothes in disarray.  LAURIE kisses him hungrily -- but he's distant, panicky, unable to respond.  It's been a long time for him.  It's not going well.  "S'posin' I declare it Would you take my love and share it? I'm not s'posin', I'm in love with you . . ."  He wriggles beneath her.  She takes his hand, presses it onto her breast.  129. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS) INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE continues UNDERNEATH as RORSCHACH backs through the kitchen with his bucket.  SMOKE billows in from the living room.  He empties TWO BOTTLES OF COOKING OIL on the linoleum floor.  Then he ducks through a door into the BACK STAIRWELL.  130. INT. STAIRWELL LANDING - A MOMENT LATER (MOS) RORSCHACH opens a bottle of CLEANING FLUID, stuffs a wad of newspaper into its neck.  The first wave of COPS -- coughing and hacking from the smoke -- makes it into the kitchen just as he IGNITES his molotov cocktail and TOSSES IT INSIDE.  The COPS pitch backward as the bottle blows up.  By the time they hit the floor, the COOKING OIL has burst into flame.  RORSCHACH bolts up the stairs; by now, another squad of CTU MEN is coming up with back way behind him.  131. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER (MOS) Charred COPS, leaping FLAMES.  CAMERA ZEROES IN on the GAS STOVE.  132. EXT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS) A GAPING HOLE blows open in the front of the building.  FIERY RUBBLE hails down on the CTU units outside.  Re-enter Fats on vocals:  "S'posin' I should hug you and caress you? . . . Would it impress you? . . ."  133. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT LAURIE is fumbling with DREIBERG's pants.  Finally he can't stand it anymore -- and with a pained, stricken look he pushes her away and sits up on the sofa.  His head sinks into his hands.  At first she doesn't understand; then her face softens, and she moves to his side, embracing his shoulders, gently stroking his hair.  ". . . Or would it distress you?"  134. INT. TENEMENT - BACK STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS) RORSCHACH huddled on the uppermost landing, just below roof level. By now the whole building is ablaze.  Two flights down, a pair of CTU COPS are fighting their way through the inferno, still on his tail.  He still has his mop bucket; it's half-full of water.  He reaches for his last can -- a can of DRANO -- and empties it into the bucket, where it begins to HISS and SIZZLE.  "S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . . Would you think I'm speaking out of turn . . ."  The COPS are almost on him, racing upward two steps at a time.  He steps out in front of them, and -- before they can hoist their weapons -- HEAVES THE BUCKETFUL OF BOILING DRANO into their faces.  The COPS SHRIEK SOUNDLESSLY and topple backwards into the flames as RORSCHACH turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof.  135. EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT RORSCHACH emerges -- and a BLINDING LIGHT catches him full in the face.  Hovering not twenty feet overhead is a POLICE AIRSHIP -- a blimp-like craft of the sort we saw earlier.  A spray of MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the roof.  "S'posin' I declare it. Would you take my love and share it? . . ."  RORSCHACH scuttles along the edge of the roof, finds a rickety FIRE ESCAPE, and dives over.  Unfortunately, he's now exposed on the front of the building -- pinned to the wall by gunfire from the SWAT TEAM on the street.  TONGUES OF FLAME dart from nearby windows.  He turns and tries to climb back upward, but more COPS -- frm the just-landed AIRSHIP -- are already spilling over the edge of the roof.  "I ain't s'posin', I'm in love with you."  The song ends.  And on the last note, RORSCHACH emits an ungodly HOWL OF FURY -- diving over the metal railing, PLUNGING to the street below.  136. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT Three stories down, he crashes into a cluster of garbage cans -- and lies there, spent, twisted, wracked with pain.  The CTU COPS are on him instantly, kicking him, pummeling him with billy clubs and rifle butts.  COPS GET HIM!  GET HIS MASK!  LET'S SEE THE LITTLE FUCKER'S FACE!!  RORSCHACH GNAAAAHH!!  NO!! NO!!  In seconds the inkblot mask is off -- revealing a pocked, doughy face topped off with a shock of MATTED RED HAIR.  It's a familiar face . . . the face of the STREET CRAZY who haunts the newsstand with his placards announcing the end of the world.  COP Christ.  He's got five-inch heels.  The fuckin' runt wears elevator shoes!  RORSCHACH NO!!  NO!!  GIVE IT BACK!!  He kicks and claws at the COPS as they drag him unceremoniously off to a nearby van.  COP II So that's the terror of the underworld.  That ugly little zero.  RORSCHACH GIVE ME BACK MY FACE!!!  The van doors slam shut on RORSCHACH -- just as the first FIRE TRUCKS arrive to turn their hoses on the flaming skeleton of the tenement.  CUT TO:  137. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE stretched out on the sofa, under a blanket.  He stares up at the ceiling, still troubled.  DREIBERG I'm sorry, Laurie.  I --  LAURIE It's all right, Dan.  I just want you to hold me, okay?  -- Just hold me.  For a few moments she lies nestled peacefully against his chest.  His gaze drifts over to the TV.  Suddenly he BLANCHES.  LAURIE Daniel.  What --  On the TV screen is a huge bluescreen closeup of RORSCHACH.  DANIEL reaches for the remote control to turn up the volume.  TV ANCHOR . . . A ten-year manhunt ended tonight with the capture of the masked vigilante known as Rorschach.  Eight CTU men died in the violent confrontation at a downtown tenement . . .  The news report CUTS LIVE to the smoking wreckage of the tenement.  LAURIE Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.  DREIBERG Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.  Now the screen shows side-by-side closeups of the inkblot mask and the acne-scarred face beneath it.  LAURIE looks on, transfixed.  TV ANCHOR . . . identified as Walter Joseph Kovacs, 44, a transient with a history of psychological disorders.  A former landlord described Kovacs as a self-confessed loner and political extremist:  LANDLORD (ON TV) All kinda weirdo literature, paraphernalia . . . you shoulda seen that place when I threw him out.  Talk about pigpens --  LAURIE hits the mute button, settles back and lets out a low whistle.  DREIBERG, distracted, pours a glass of wine and gets up to pace the room.  LAURIE I just realized.  I'd never seen his face. (beat) I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?  DREIBERG The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.  He stares at her, obviously wondering: who's next?  138. EXT. NEWS KIOSK - EVENING The familiar NEWS VENDOR peddling papers.  A feisty little BLACK KID -- the same one who made a face at RORSCHACH -- sits on the pavement nearby, reading a comic book.  The NEWS VENDOR nudges him, indicates the comic book: a patriotic little number entitled "COLONEL NORTH AND HIS HOWLING COMMANDOS."  NEWS VENDOR Hey, this ain't a lending library.  I expect you to pay me for that.  KID No way.  This one sucks.  A CUSTOMER -- 50, black, on the tubby side -- stops at the newsstand.  His name is DR. MALCOLM LONG.  DR. LONG Gazette, please.  The NEWS VENDOR hands over a copy of the Gazette.  The cover bears side-by-side photos of RORSCHACH and his alter ego, KOVACS, with the banner headline: "CTU APPREHENDS MASKED KILLER."  NEWS VENDOR 'Dyou see this?  This guy's a customer of mine! (shaking his head) I mean, I always knew he was a little flaky, but -- wild, huh?  You never know.  LONG hands over a quarter, unfolds the paper and begins to read as he wanders off down the street.  139. STUDY - NIGHT DR. LONG, who happens to be a police psychiatrist, sits at a big desk with a vast heap of paperwork -- which includes a mug sheet of RORSCHACH (minus the mask) and a neatly-typed arrest report from the NYPD:  NAME: Kovacs, Walter Joseph ADDRESS: Transient BORN: 3/21/43 MOTHER'S NAME: Kovacs, Sylvia J. (nee Glick) FATHER'S NAME: Unknown  By now LONG is working on his third pot of coffee.  His wife, SYLVIA, wanders in behind him, dressed for bed in her robe and slippers.  When she rests her hands on his shoulders, he nearly jumps out of his seat.  DR. LONG Oh!  Sorry.  I didn't hear you.  SYLVIA How much longer? (staring down at the desk) It's that vigilante, isn't it.  That --  DR. LONG Rorschach (correcting himself) Kovacs.  Incredible case.  Blinded two children at the age of ten. We pulled his record from the juvenile home --  Without looking up he shoves a sheaf of papers in SYLVIA's direction.  DR. LONG (cont.) No father.  Mother a prostitute.  Some evidence of systematic child abuse . . . (swiveling to face her) Classic case of misplaced aggression.  You know, these vigilantes, these "Watchmen" -- there's never been a systematic study to find out just what makes them do it.  SYLVIA Malcolm, don't get too -- overwhelmed by all this.  SYLVIA picks up a blurry xerox of a child's drawing: TWO HIDEOUS FIGURES, male and female, with wild eyes, fangs, and matted hair. They're conjoined like Siamese twins at the mouth, belly, and crotch.  This twisted vision of coitus bears the crayoned title "MY DREAM by W.J. Kovacs, Age 13."  It's too strong to look at for long.  She sets it down with a shiver.  SYLVIA (cont.) Why don't you come to bed?  DR. LONG (totally engrossed) I'd like to get my hands on some of the others.  Explosive material. (grabbing a transcript)  Mother died when he was fourteen.  When they told him, he had one word of comment: "Good."  SYLVIA shoots him a hard look, shakes her head almost imperceptibly, and gives up.  She turns and pads silently out of the room.  LONG goes right on talking, unaware that his audience has left.  DR. LONG (cont.) Still, he's not stupid.  In some ways he's got an extraordinary mind.  I think I can reach him. (nodding his head) I can reach him.  CUT TO:  140. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY A bare, windowless chamber, 10' by 10'.  LONG and RORSCHACH sit in folding chairs on opposite sides of a square table.  The doctor reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a stack of CARDS.  DR. LONG Now, Walter, you obviously know what these are.  I want you to look at each card in turn and tell me what it reminds you of.  All right?  RORSCHACH's face is bruised, bloodied, and blank.  DR. LONG turns up the first card, a symmetrical inkblot, part of a Rorschach test.  RORSCHACH Butterfly.  LONG nods, makes a notation on a pad, turns up the next card.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Some nice flowers.  LONG eyes him skeptically, makes another note, turns up the third card.  RORSCHACH stares at it for a long moment.  RORSCHACH (cont.) A doggy.  A big old floppy-eared dog.  He shows the hint of a smile.  DR. LONG heaves a sigh of frustration.  DR. LONG Walter --  RORSCHACH Don't call me that.  DR. LONG Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.  RORSCHACH Wrong answers?  DR. LONG There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you. (pause) I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.  RORSCHACH Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.  LONG knows the standard procedure for intransigent cases like this. He shrugs indifferently, reaches for his briefcase, then gropes under the table and presses a buzzer to summon the guards.  DR. LONG Well, then.  Have it your way, Walter.  Let me know when you decide to cooperate.  TWO PRISON GUARDS enter through a steel door.  RORSCHACH gets up to leave.  He pauses in the doorway.  RORSCHACH Doctor.  You don't want to help me.  You just want to find out what makes me sick. (beat) You'll find out.  -- You'll find out.  CUT TO:  141. INT. VEIDT INDUSTRIES PYRAMID - DAY A huge open atrium on the ground floor, with marble columns, fountains, eucalyptus trees -- an Egyptian pleasure garden. JUSTINE's hanging out with her video crew; they spot VEIDT on the central escalator and swing into action.  JUSTINE Adrian!  Adrian!  Can you give us a comment of Rorschach?  He's not at all happy to see her.  His FLUNKIES -- bodyguards and secretaries -- form a wedge around him as he tries to push past the cameras.  VEIDT No comment.  JUSTINE Did you know he was back on the streets?  VEIDT I did not.  Now get out of my way!  JUSTINE Isn't it true that you --  He keeps walking, with JUSTINE in hot pursuit.  Then, wide-eyed, he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.  An ARMED GUNMAN has stepped out from behind a pillar -- directly into VEIDT's path.  ASSASSIN VEIDT!  VEIDT DIVES.  The ASSASSIN'S BULLET catches JUSTINE in the gut and comes out the other side in a spray of blood.  With a gymnast's agility VEIDT rolls to the right -- and comes up with a BRASS ASHTRAY in his hands.  He swings it into the ASSASSIN'S RIBS, knocking him backward into a FOUNTAIN.  The GUN skitters off across the marble floor.  As the SECURITY STAFF races up, VEIDT steps INTO THE FOUNTAIN and slams the dazed ASSASSIN'S HEAD into a decorative bust of King Tut.  VEIDT Son of a bitch.  Who sent you?  Arms flying, the two men grapple.  VEIDT grabs hold of a ASSASSIN's hair and thrusts a HAND into his MOUTH.  SECURITY GUARD Stand back, Mr. Veidt!  We'll handle it!  VEIDT He's got some kind of poison capsule.  Don't bite down, you scum, I want to know who sent you!  The ASSASSIN gags -- and GOES LIMP.  His lifeless body slumps down into the water.  VEIDT steps out, shaken and breathless.  VEIDT Goddammit . . .  SECURITY GUARD Who'd wanna kill you, Mr. Veidt?  VEIDT I don't know.  I don't know.  -- Get an ambulance for Miss James.  CUT TO:  142. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - DUSK TIGHT ON a portable TV tuned to the evening news.  NEWSCASTER -- third day of rioting in major European capitals amid escalating fears of nuclear war.  In London, six people were trampled outside St. Paul's cathedral when overflow crowds were turned away from morning Mass --  A PHONE RINGS.  DREIBERG, who's sprawled on his bed watching the TV, reaches for the receiver.  DREIBERG Yeah. (beat) Adrian!  What's up?  143. INTERCUT VEIDT AND DREIBERG VEIDT In have something to tell you.  I wanted to call before you heard it on the news. (beat) Someone tried to kill me today.  For a moment DREIBERG says nothing.  He's not altogether surprised.  DREIBERG Who?  VEIDT I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?  DREIBERG She's with me.  VEIDT Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard. (beat) Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.  DREIBERG Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.  He hangs up and weighs his options while he stares at the box. LAURIE enters from the hallway, dressed in a bathrobe, toweling off her hair.  LAURIE Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?  DREIBERG One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian. (beat) . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.  He doesn't say any more than that.  He doesn't have to.  LAURIE picks up on the implications immediately.  She exhales sharply, turns away from him and steadies herself against a bureau.  DREIBERG -- What is it.  LAURIE I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.  DREIBERG Laurie --  LAURIE I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --  DREIBERG With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.  His sour wisecrack starts her trembling -- almost crying.  DREIBERG, fed up with his own pessimism, climbs out of bed and walks over behind her.  LAURIE I shouldn't be here anyway, Daniel.  There's something I haven't told you --  But before she does he shushes her, wraps his arms around her from behind.  DREIBERG Laurie, I'm not afraid.  I want you with me.  I want it more than anything else in the world.  CUT TO:  144. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT CONVICTS lined up with metal trays at a long cafeteria-style serving area.  RORSCHACH enters in prison greys.  As he makes his way toward the dinner line, we PICK UP a chorus of comments from the nearby tables:  VOICE Hey Rorschach.  You dead, man.  Just a matter of time now --  VOICE II Rorschach.  Better put some meat on that pretty ass of yours --  Low, threatening CHUCKLES all around as an expressionless RORSCHACH picks up his tray.  A TRIO OF GOONS falls in behind him.  The smallest of them outweighs him by a good forty pounds.  GOON I Didn't know he was such a tiny little thing.  GOON II Little?  Naw, he's a big man.  Big man.  RORSCHACH'S FACE shows no emotion.  He moves forward in the line.  A SERVER drops a gristly chunk of meat on his tin plate.  GOON III I'd like to get his autograph.  I got my autograph book right here. . .  GOON III reaches into his pocket and withdraws an ICEPICK.  GOON III (cont.) Notched up some big names over the years.  Suddenly RORSCHACH spins, catching GOON III's head with the edge of his dinner tray.  The icepick clatters to the floor.  GOON III follows.  The others are on him in an instant, PINNING HIM against the serving counter.  Instead of resisting, RORSCHACH vaults backward.  He brings a KNEE up into GOON II's chine, grabs a fistful of GOON I's hair, and tumbles back OVER THE COUNTER -- dragging GOON I's head, face down, into a steam tray full of bubbling SOUP.  Landing on his feet, keeping his grip on GOON I's hair, RORSCHACH uses his free hand to bury a FORK in a CAFETERIA WORKER's gut.  GOON II lunges at him across the counter.  He grabs a VAT off a nearby burner and, with a single sweep of the arm, DOUSES both GOONS -- with HOT COOKING FAT.  All this has taken five seconds maximum.  WHISTLES shriek as the two disfigured GOONS writhe on the floor in hideous agony, faces cracked and smoking.  CAFETERIA WORKERS clear a path as PRISON GUARDS rush in with billy clubs drawn.  As the GUARDS haul him off, RORSCHACH emits a ferocious HISS.  It sounds uncannily like the sizzle of boiling oil on human flesh.  CUT TO:  145. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - NIGHT A prison TRUSTY wheels a cart down a long, empty corridor -- delivering dinner to the prisoners in solitary confinement.  Some of the cells are visible, through ordinary barred entries; others are totally sealed off, with sliding service trays mounted in solid metal doors.  At a cell of the latter kind, the TRUSTY knocks once on the door, then throws back a small panel to reveal the impassive face of RORSCHACH.  TRUSTY Hey Rorschach.  Those cats you threw the grease on -- they're dyin' man. (beat) Their friends are talkin' 'bout it.  Say if those two go under . . . this whole place blows.  RORSCHACH emits his trademark HISS and turns from the door.  The TRUSTY chuckles in anticipation.  TRUSTY (cont.) I'd hate to be you, man.  Locked in here with the likes of --  RORSCHACH I'm not locked in here with them.  They're locked in here with me.  With that, the panel slides suddenly SHUT in the TRUSTY's face.  CUT TO:  146. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY LONG and RORSCHACH have changed rooms.  The new room -- two chairs, a square table -- is identical to the first, except for the REINFORCED WIRE MESH which spans its width, separating doctor from patient.  Through a narrow opening in the wire, DR. LONG slides a card across the table for RORSCHACH's inspection.  It's the same series of inkblots as before, the "butterfly" leading off.  But this time, the subject has decided to cooperate:  RORSCHACH A whore fucking.  DR. LONG Who is she?  Do you know her?  Too obvious; no response.  LONG moves on to card #2 -- the "nice flowers":  RORSCHACH (cont.) Man's guts.  Falling out of his shirt.  LONG clears his throat almost imperceptibly and nods.  Card #3:  RORSCHACH (cont.) Doggy.  Big old floppy-eared dog -- (pause; then, smiling) -- with his skull split open.  DR. LONG And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?  RORSCHACH Why, doctor.  I did. (beat) He was a bad dog.  RORSCHACH is toying with him now.  DR. LONG gets down to brass tacks.  DR. LONG Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?  RORSCHACH God isn't there to do it.  DR. LONG We don't know that.  RORSCHACH eyes him for a moment, then nods sagely: oh yes we do.  DR. LONG So the rest of the world is wrong, and you're right.  Is that it? (no response) You tried to help people once.  What turned you around?  -- Why would you want to kill a dog?  With LONG firmly on the hook, RORSCHACH settles back to elucidate:  RORSCHACH One night I opened my eyes -- saw the world.  147. EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DUSK (FLASHBACK) Ruined buildings, broken windows.  The streets are silent except for the distant sound of dogs BARKING.  RORSCHACH'S NARRATION continues OVER SCENE:  RORSCHACH (V.O.) '75.  Kidnap case, the little Franco girl.  Weeks dragged by -- no word.  Thought of little child, alone, frightened . . . decided to intervene.  The lone figure of RORSCHACH emerges from the shadows and turns up his collar.  He strides deliberately down the sidewalk past a ramshackle wooden storm fence covered with obscene graffiti.  RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.) Got a tip.  Abandoned dress factory in Brooklyn.  He peers through a broken slat in the fence.  In a side yard, TWO HUGE GERMAN SHEPHERDS growl playfully, fighting over some unseen object.  148. INT. DRESS FACTORY - DUSK (FLASHBACK) A DOOR swings open and RORSCHACH enters.  He pockets a metal file, flicks on a flashlight.  Mannequins, decrepit sewing machines, rolls of rotting fabric.  The light shines on a small, dank cot in the corner.  RORSCHACH wanders over.  He finds opened tins of food, an overturned water glass -- and on the floor, a ROPE.  There's a pot-bellied stove nearby.  RORSCHACH crouches beside it, sticks a hand inside, and sifts through the ashes; he pulls out a charred scrap of FABRIC from a child's pajamas, decorated with balloons and teddy bears.  He stands.  In the opposite corner of the room is a big wooden CHOPPING BLOCK.  RORSCHACH wanders over and examines the surrounding paraphernalia: a cleaver, a bone saw, an assortment of butcher's knives.  He stands there a moment, then moves to a wire-mesh WINDOW.  RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.) Dogs wouldn't shut up.  That's when I knew where the little girl had gone.  149. HIS POV - THE YARD OUTSIDE - DUSK (FLASHBACK) The German shepherds romp in the dying light.  We CLOSE IN ON the dogs until we see what it is they're tussling over: A BIG BLOODY KNOB OF BONE.  RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.) Decided to wait for the owner . . .  150. INT. FACTORY - ENTRY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) Keys in the lock.  A moment later, the door swings wide;  a FAT MAN enters and whistles to the dogs.  FAT MAN Fred?  Barney?  Dinnerti--  RORSCHACH steps out of the shadows and BASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD.  151. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY RORSCHACH, master of suspense, decides to take a break in the story.  He leans back in his chair.  Finally DR. LONG, dreading his reply, asks:  DR. LONG Then what happened?  RORSCHACH . . . Made a little trip to the butcher store.  Locked up tight.  Had to break in.  152. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) The FAT MAN squirms on the floor, a gag in his mouth.  He's handcuffed to an exposed pipe.  RORSCHACH strides into frame with a GROCERY SACK.  He kneels beside the FAT MAN and loosens his gag.  Then he peels off his glove and reaches into the sack.  FAT MAN What -- what are you d--  RORSCHACH silences the FAT MAN by cramming a fistful of RAW HAMBURGER into his open mouth.  He's got several pounds of the stuff, and he spends the next few seconds SMEARING IT all over the FAT MAN's face, throat, and hands, stuffing the leftovers down his shirt.  When he's done, he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of STEER BLOOD . . . and EMPTIES IT over the FAT MAN's head.  FRANTIC SCRATCHING from outside.  RORSCHACH strolls over to the door, and -- as the FAT MAN wriggles in helpless terror -- lets the dogs inside.  Then he stands back and enjoys the carnage.  153. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY DR. LONG looks on goggle-eyed as RORSCHACH cheerfully wraps things up.  RORSCHACH When they finished eating, picked up a cleaver . . .  split their skulls.  Died happy.  Full bellies. (leaning forward) See, God didn't kill the little girl.  Or the man that killed her . . . or the dogs, or me.  If God saw what any of us did, he did't seem to mind.  DR. LONG That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --  RORSCHACH Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image. (slight smile) What else can I illuminate?  LONG's had enough.  He reaches for the concealed buzzer and the PRISON GUARDS file in.  RORSCHACH gets up; before he turns to go, he points a finger at LONG's inkblot.  RORSCHACH (cont.) No right and wrong, Doc.  You said so.  Maybe not a dog.  Maybe . . . just a man's face. (pause) See it now?  The GUARDS drag RORSCHACH out.  DR. LONG, still queasy, empties a couple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry.  After a second he reaches for his briefcase; as he's gathering his cards, he STOPS suddenly -- his gaze riveted to the random, symmetrical pattern on top of the stack.  Its seems to SHIFT before his eyes.  LONG blinks, swallows hard.  We MOVE IN tighter and tighter on the Rorschach blot, INKY BLACKNESS filling the screen as we.  DISSOLVE TO:  154. EXT. BARN - TOWARD DUSK A rural tree-lined area outside the city.  A COMPACT BUBBLE-CAR pulls up outside a big ramshackle barn and stops; DREIBERG gets out, goes to the padlocked doors, fumbles in his pocket for a key.  After a moment, LAURIE wanders up beside him.  LAURIE Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?  DREIBERG Memory lane.  He opens the padlock, ushers LAURIE inside.  155. INT. BARN - A MOMENT LATER Inside the barn is a HUGE OBLONG SHAPE covered with a TARPAULIN.  LAURIE Daniel . . .  DREIBERG Gimme a hand with the tarp, would you?  You take that side.  She goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp.  The two of them pull it back to reveal . . .  THE OWLSHIP -- NIGHT OWL's high-tech HOVERCRAFT.  It's a bit tarnished from years of disuse, but it's still an impressive sight. DREIBERG stands back to admire it; an impressed LAURIE wanders around to join him, wearing an ear-to-ear grin.  LAURIE The Owlship.  I can't believe it.  DREIBERG -- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.  156. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT The two of them enter.  DREIBERG sits at the controls and turns on the electrical system while LAURIE wanders through the cabin, reliving days gone by.  LAURIE Wow, this brings back some memories.  Does it still fly?  DREIBERG I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.  LAURIE Antarctica??  DREIBERG Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along. (pause) I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.  LAURIE Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.  DREIBERG You and me.  He looks directly at her.  Suddenly uncomfortable, she averts her gaze, gets up, and begins rummaging around in the back of the cabin.  DREIBERG turns back to the control panel, feeling subtly rejected.  DREIBERG . . . Yeah, you're right.  Probably wouldn't make it down there anyway.  Behind him, LAURIE lets out a little SQUEAL of delight.  She's just opened a compartment door; inside it are a handful of GAUDY COSTUMES -- their old superhero togs.  LAURIE Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.  DREIBERG Me neither.  Mine barely even fits. (chuckling) The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.  LAURIE's holding her old costume up against her shoulders, eyeing herself in a small mirror above a sink.  LAURIE God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.  DREIBERG What are you up to?  LAURIE Don't look.  Turn around.  Smirking, he complies.  LAURIE begins to undress in the back of the cabin.  DREIBERG This'd better not be what I think it is.  LAURIE Okay!  DREIBERG turns around.  LAURIE's in full costume, looking quite imposing and, in a perverse way, quite beautiful.  He feigns shock:  DREIBERG (cont.) My God, it's the Silk Spectre -- scourge of the underworld, defender of the weak!  LAURIE In the flesh.  She ambles over to the control panel, embraces DREIBERG from behind, and strokes his thinning hair.  LAURIE (cont.) Poor Daniel.  You really miss it all, don't you.  DREIBERG Saving the world?  I guess I do. (smiling) Maybe we can still save ourselves . . .  DISSOLVE TO:  157. EXT. SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - DUSK A massive PEACE RALLY downtown.  Thousands of citizens have turned out; PLACARDS and PROTEST SIGNS are everywhere.  Each remark is met by CHEERS and CHANTS, by raucous BOOS as well . . . and while the crowd is split between pacifists and hawks, they're all frightened as hell.  Things are much the same in London, Berlin -- possibly even Moscow. The end is nigh, and passions flare.  It's anarchy waiting to happen.  MAN ON STAGE You know what the Joint Chiefs of Staff are doing right now?  They're sitting in the Pentagon talking about a first strike.  That's right -- a first strike!  VOICE IN CROWD You think the reds ain't doing the same thing?  MAN ON STAGE Then for the love of God let's negotiate.  We can start a war.  But we can't stop it!!  VOICE IN CROWD II It's pinko simps like you that drove Dr. Manhattan to Mars!  VOICE IN CROWD III Dr. Manhattan was an inhuman fascist!  VOICE IN CROWD IV It's God's judgment!  Jesus is the way!  A HECKLER fights his way onstage and lunges for the microphone:  HECKLER Russia's just been waiting for an opening.  They won't show us no mercy.  I say NUKE 'EM NOW!!  MAN ON STAGE You think this is some kind of grudge match??  We're talking the end of the world!!  The two of them grapple at the mike, and the HECKLER falls off the stage.  On cue, the crowd ERUPTS.  FIGHTS break out; COPS start swinging rifle butts.  As PRO-NUKERS swarm the stage, our gaze turns upward.  A trio of HOVERCRAFT hangs in the air above the seaport.  Their undersides -- outfitted with heavy artillery on turrets -- bear the initials "CTU"  158. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK CTU MEN watch the nascent riot through a plexiglass canopy.  CTU CAPTAIN I've had it with these a-holes.  Drop the gas.  159. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK PANIC amongs the crowds as TEAR GAS CANISTERS explode in their midst.  The CTU ships descend ever closer to the ground.  LOUDSPEAKER CEASE AND DESIST AT ONCE.  WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO USE FORCE.  A couple of COPS go down in the melee.  RIOTERS grab their rifles, turn them on the CTU ships overhead.  OTHERS in the crowd fling rocks, brickbats -- whatever's handy.  HYSTERIA RULES.  CUT TO:  160. INT. BARN - DUSK DREIBERG walks around to the front of the Owlship with a TOOLKIT, wiping his hands on an oily rag.  He calls inside to LAURIE:  DREIBERG Guess that ought to do it.  Let's shut her down --  Laurie?  No reply.  Curious, he climbs aboard.  161. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT LAURIE's standing by the monitor over the instrument console.  Her face is distraught, agonized.  LAURIE Daniel, you ought to take a look at this.  Onscreen, it's total screaming chaos.  CANNONS on the bellies of the CTU HOVERCRAFT swivel randomly, spitting AUTOMATIC FIRE at the mobs below.  DREIBERG What the hell -- ?  LAURIE It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.  DREIBERG Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.  He turns away, paralyzed with horror.  LAURIE watches awestruck.  LAURIE They're just mowing 'em down. (pause) This is it.  The end of the world.  This is what it looks like.  CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on DREIBERG's stricken face as we  CUT TO:  162. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE> We're back in slo-mo sepia land, the Golden Age of Superheroes.  THE OWLSHIP emerges from a fogbank and rises majestically into frame, like the Seventh Cavalry arriving to save the day.  As it draws closer, the perspex canopy coming into view, we can just make out NIGHT OWL at the helm, with SILK SPECTRE riding shotgun.  There's a FRENZIED MOB below, racing right and left, their aimless motions stylized and surreal.  They're beset by a sudden WINDSTORM as the Owlship's powerful BLOWERS clear the TEAR GAS from this fantasy equivalent of the seaport plaza.  Faces turn skyward; fingers point --  -- and suddenly, the footage we're watching undergoes a SUBTLE TRANSFORMATION.  COLORS bleed in; SOUND comes up; the pace of the action QUICKENS.  And when we cut back to the ship overhead, we're in full-color and real-time --  163. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP -- because the Owlship is really there . . . and by God, the Watchmen are back in action a quarter-mile above the South St. Seaport!  164. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT The three CTU SHIPS are now visible through the cockpit dome.  DREIBERG Okay Laurie, let's see if we've still got what it takes.  On the panel, a COMPUTER TARGETING DEVICE homes in on a CTU SHIP.  165. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT A RADAR MAN stares at his console in puzzlement.  CTU RADAR MAN Sir, we've got an odd blip off starboard . . .  The ship ROCKS VIOLENTLY as a sudden EXPLOSION --  166. AERIAL SHOT - ON CTU HOVERCRAFT -- BLOWS THE CANNON MOUNT CLEANLY OFF ITS UNDERSIDE!!  The ruptured ship WOBBLES, trying to right itself, but to no avail; jets sputtering, it lurches toward the harbor and SLAPS DOWN HARD against the water.  167. ANGLE ON CROWD pointing at the skies in disbelief.  VOICE IN CROWD LOOK!  UP THERE!  VOICE IN CROWD II Oh my God, it's --   168. INT. OWLSHIP - ON DREIBERG He barks into a microphone:  DREIBERG Attention CTU!  Cease fire immediately --  169. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK Ground level.  From the midst of the bewildered CROWD we watch as the OWLSHIP and the CTU talk some serious trash:  OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER -- or we'll BLOW YOUR ASSES OUT OF THE SKY!  CTU LOUDSPEAKER UNREGISTERED CRAFT.  IDENTIFY YOURSELF.  OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER BABY . . . WE'RE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.  The crowd's in a frenzy.  Most of them are taking it on the lam.  But a dozen hardy souls are standing stock-still, transfixed by the strange sight overhead.  VOICE IN CROWD . . . IT'S THE WATCHMEN!!  EXCITEMENT RIPPLES through the CROWD as the CTU SHIPS bob in the air, clumsily turning to face their attacker.  Soon the ships are hanging immobile in midair, squaring off face-to-face, a Wild West showdown.  On the prows of all three craft, MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate into position.  170. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT DREIBERG with his hand poised on the throttle.  DREIBERG We're gonna have to shave this one close.  An instant before the CTU rockets FIRE, DREIBERG shoves the throttle FULL-FORWARD.  171. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP With a burst of flame, the Owlship BLASTS OFF.  The TWO ROCKETS CONVERGE on the point where the OWLSHIP was hovering a millisecond before -- and COLLIDE.  BOOM.  The OWLSHIP, meanwhile, HURTLES FORWARD -- slicing DIRECTLY BETWEEN the two CTU SHIPS.  The CROWD CHEERS.  172. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT DREIBERG rides the JOYSTICK.  LAURIE watches a monitor showing the aft view from the ship.  LAURIE They're following us.  DREIBERG All right.  Mission accomplished.  He's no sooner said it than MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the rear of the ship.  He arcs hard left and DROPS, taking evasive action.  173. EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER - NIGHT The OWLSHIP streaks between the twin towers.  A second later, the CTU SHIPS rip past on either side.  174. EXT. STREET - NIGHT ASTONISHED PEDESTRIANS GAPE at the bizarre DOGFIGHT above them.  The OWLSHIP doglegs around a darkened office building.  A CTU MISSILE blows a HOLE in its facade.  175. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP firing TWO MISSILES aftward at the pursuing craft.  176. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT DREIBERG exhilarated.  LAURIE, worried, checking the radar readout:  LAURIE Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!  DREIBERG I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.  LAURIE (checking the monitor) They're practically on us . . .  DREIBERG That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.  He punches a button on the dash.  It's labelled "TURBO."  177. AERIAL SHOT - ON AIRSHIP The turbojets kick in and the Owlship ACCELERATES to 400 mph, leaving the CTU craft in the dust.  178. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT A line of TRAFFIC enters the tunnel.  The Owlship SWOOPS suddenly, and -- just clearing the arch -- ENTERS ABOVE THEM.  A moment later, the LEAD CTU SHIP tries to follow.  Bad move.  The less-maneuverable craft rams into the LIP of the arch -- and EXPLODES  The SECOND CTU SHIP hurtles toward a similar fate.  But at the last moment -- retro-jets blasting at full force -- it manages to STOP ITSELF.  It backs up slightly, edges up OVER the tunnel, and settles for the airborne route.  179. INT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER The OWLSHIP zooms through the tunnel, mere feet above the tops of the cars.  HORNS HONK.  BRAKES SCREECH.  There's an oversized TRUCK directly in its path.  The OWLSHIP nudges UP slightly -- and clears the truck by INCHES, throwing off SPARKS against the roof of the tunnel.  180. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT The end of the tunnel is coming up fast.  DREIBERG Fog blowers on.  Activate radar shields.  181. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - OPPOSITE END - NIGHT The OWLSHIP emerges from the tunnel and noses UPWARD at an almost-vertical angle, spewing DENSE CLOUDS OF BILLOWING FOG in its wake.  A few seconds later, the lone remaining CTU ship arrives -- but, seeing only FOG and no trace of the OWLSHIP, it pushes forward on a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the water.  182. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT They're in the middle of a cloudbank.  DREIBERG is wearing a look of intense satisfaction as LAURIE nervously checks the radar.  LAURIE We lost him.  He flashes her a smug little smile.  LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, she shakes her head and buries her faces in her hands.  LAURIE (cont.) Oh, Daniel . . . we are in deep shit now.  FADE THROUGH TO:  183. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT The usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving line.  A PRISON TRUSTY, in hospital-orderly whites, enters the hall and falls in at the end of the line.  He nudges the CON in front of him.  TRUSTY Just left the infirmary.  Lost Otis about twenty minutes ago.  The CON nods, and whispers to the man in front of him.  The news goes through the serving line like wildfire.  Within a matter of seconds, it's reached the jailbird at the front of the line -- a hulk named T-BONE.  CON IN LINE Otis went down.  T-BONE nods and carries his tray to a nearby table, where a cadre of SIX ENORMOUS THUGS are munching away.  Presiding over them is the biggest man in the pen -- who happens, ironically, to be a MIDGET: LITTLE BIGGER.  T-BONE Just heard, boss.  Otis bought it.  LITTLE BIGGER Fuckin' Rorschach. (nodding to himself) This joint goes up.  Tonight.  184. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT Drifting lazily through a cloudbank.  The blunt prow of the owlship emerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale blue moonlight.  185. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT Through the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers, then disappears again behind wisps of cloud.  We're taking a dreamy tour of the stratosphere, slow and elegant.  Somewhere, Billie Holiday is singing "You're My Thrill."  Instruments blink and peep on the panel.  No one's at the controls.  The ship lurches.  A wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the width of the cabin floor.  A woman's hand reaches for it, sets it right.  It's LAURIE, who's midway through a two-minute kiss with DREIBERG. The pair of them are locking in a tight, post-coital embrace on the cabin floor, their clothing in heaps around them.  LAURIE Better.  Much better.  DREIBERG starts to say something, settles back with a serene smile instead.  LAURIE (cont.) I bet I know what made the difference this time.  DREIBERG What?  LAURIE (smirking) The costumes.  Am I right?  DREIBERG seems mildly shocked by the proposition.  Then, despite himself, he starts to chortle.  She pokes him playfully on the arm.  LAURIE (cont.) Come on.  Admit it!  DREIBERG No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.  LAURIE Yes you are.  DREIBERG (drily) No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on. (pause; then, seriously) Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.  LAURIE That's because --  DREIBERG It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end. (a weird smile) I feel like I could save it.  He grabs his cloak, wraps it around him, and moves purposefully to the instrument panel.  He throws a few switches, arcs the Owlship hard right.  LAURIE You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?  DREIBERG Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . . (turning to face her) I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.  LAURIE . . . What??  DREIBERG -- rejuvenated, exhilarated, smiling ear-to-ear -- reaches for the throttle and kicks the ship in to overdrive.  186. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT AFTERBURNERS belch flame as the Owlship accelerates, ripping through the clouds above the city.  CUT TO:  187. SERIES OF SHOTS - THE PRISON -- and as Sly Stone once said, there's a riot goin' on.  SIRENS HOWL as we get several quick glimpses of gleeful CONVICTS running wild: disabling guards, overrunning cell blocks, liberating weapons, throwing food.  188. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT DREIBERG and LAURIE, back in full costume.  DREIBERG's eyes are riveted to a monitor over the controls:  DREIBERG I think we're just a trifle late.  LAURIE Jesus, Dan.  Out of the frying pan . . .  The MONITOR shows a magnified view of the PRISON COMPLEX below them.  The prisoners have taken the quad, and are exchanging fire with the guards in the watchtower.  It's an ugly, bloody mess.  DREIBERG I know he's totally bugfuck, but he saved my life a half a dozen times.  189. INT. CELL - NIGHT SIRENS BLARING everywhere.  RORSCHACH sits on his bunk, his legs drawn up before him, his eyes darting swiftly around the cell.  190. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY BLOCK - NIGHT Smoke and confusion; ESCAPED CONVICTS racing to and fro past sprawled, unconscious GUARDS.  In the midst of all the chaos, FOUR MENACING FIGURES stride purposefully through the cellblock.  It's the psychotic midget LITTLE BIGGER, with his three henchmen CARLOS, RAFE, and T-BONE.  Wheeling an oversized ELECTRICAL ARC WELDER before them, they stop outside RORSCHACH's cell and GRIN in anticipation.  LITTLE BIGGER Find an outlet for this thing (shouting) Rorschach?  I did fifteen years because of you.  It's payback time!  RAFE finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder.  CARLOS is carrying a big nasty MEAT CLEAVER; he slides back the panel in RORSCHACH's door, rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame.  CARLOS See this, runt?  We're gonna take your puny little balls off . . . and pickle 'em!! (chortling) Aww!  I think he just wet his pants!  HILARITY all around.  T-BONE shoves CARLOS aside and takes his place at the panel in the door:  T-BONE Lemme see.  Lemme see!  LITTLE BIGGER Relax, boys.  Everybody gets a slice of turkey -- but I get to carve. (to T-BONE) What's he doin' now?  No response from T-BONE, who stands there with his face pressed tightly to the panel.  LITTLE BIGGER (cont.) You deaf?  I said, what's he --  He gives T-BONE a nudge.  T-BONE's legs buckle and he topples over backwards, landing flat as a board on the floor.  A SOUP SPOON quivers ion the air, its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye socket.  RAFE BOSS!  JESUS!  LITTLE BIGGER Son of a bitch! -- WE'RE COMING RORSCHACH.  WE'RE GONNA PEEL YOU LIKE A GRAPE. (to RAFE) Light the torch.  RAFE ignites the arc welder and the boys go to work on the lock of RORSCHACH's cage.  191. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT RORSCHACH waiting patiently on his bunk.  The metal lock on the inside of the cell door is beginning to glow a dull red.  CUT TO:  192. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT DREIBERG hands LAURIE what looks like a pair of electronic EARMUFFS.  DREIBERG Okay, I'm turning on the screamers.  We'll have to hit the roof running . . .  He throws a switch on the control panel.  193. EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT WINDOWS SHATTER in the guard towers as a WAILING ULTRASONIC SCREECH splits the air.  On the roof of the complex, PARALYZED GUARDS drop their weapons; ESCAPED PRISONERS clutch at their burst eardrums as the Owlship descends and gently touches down. . .  194. INT. RORSCHACH'S CELL - THAT MOMENT The LOCK is bright red and smoking.  Over on the bunk, RORSCHACH'S FACE is lined with exertion.  His back is wedged tight against the wall of the cell, his legs straining against the lip of his TOILET.  Grunting and groaning, he manages to knock the TOILET off its mounting.  The PIPES SPEW.  Within seconds, the FLOOR of the cell is FLOODED.  195. INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE DOOR - A MOMENT LATER RAFE kills the arc welder and stands back.  RAFE Okay, boss, that oughta do it.  They give the door a shove.  It swings inward, and GALLONS OF WATER come gushing out.  LITTLE BIGGER steps back in disgust.  LITTLE BIGGER WHAT THE --  RAFE and CARLOS gape into the cell.  They see the broken toilet, but there's no trace of RORSCHACH.  CARLOS Rorschach.  Company's calling . . .  RAFE Where is the fuckin' runt?  CARLOS advances cautiously toward the cell, the CLEAVER in his fist.  196. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT In answer to RAFE's question, RORSCHACH is hiding behind the door. He SLAMS IT SHUT on CARLO's outstretched hand; the red-hot metal of the LOCK catches CARLO'S WRIST; he shrieks and drops the cleaver. . .  . . . giving RORSCHACH just enough time to SNATCH IT UP.  He JUMPS, monkey-like, and STANDS POISED ON HIS BUNK as the door swings wide and an enraged CARLOS charges in, clutching his scorched forearm.  CARLOS YOU'RE MINE NOW, YOU LITTLE --  From the bunk, RORSCHACH FLINGS the cleaver.  It strikes the floor BETWEEN RAFE and CARLOS --  -- NEATLY SEVERING THE POWER CORD of the ARC WELDER --  -- which is SITTING in an INCH OF STANDING WATER.  RAFE and CARLOS do a herky-jerky DANCE as 20,000 VOLTS course through their bodies --  -- and PITCH face-down into the water.  All lights in the cellblock DIM and DIE.  LITTLE BIGGER backs off in gibbering horror as RORSCHACH climbs down off his bunk, emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies of the dead.  RORSCHACH Your move . . . runt.  The midget kingpin lets out a SCREAM and tears off down the corridor as fast as his stubby little legs will carry him.  197. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER DREIBERG and LAURIE move down a dark, abandoned corridor, trying to get their bearings.  LAURIE Where are we?  What happened to the lights?  DREIBERG Generators'll kick on in a minute.  We should be close to solitary . . .  Their heads turn toward the end of the passage, where a SECOND CORRIDOR crosses the one they're standing in.  As they watch, a SCREAMING MIDGET sprints past -- and disappears.  DREIBERG and LAURIE blink in disbelief: huh?  A moment later, a familiar figure with BRIGHT RED HAIR strides past.  DREIBERG . . . Rorschach??  RORSCHACH pauses.  He stares at his costumed colleagues for a second and a half -- then keeps on walking.  198. INT. PRISON - CROSS CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER The terrified LITTLE BIGGER realizes he's just hit a dead end.  He throws a glance over his shoulder, sees RORSCHACH moving up on him. Desperate, he ducks into a MEN'S ROOM.  RORSCHACH follows, his pace measured and deliberate.  Behind him, LAURIE and DREIBERG have just rounded the corner into the cross corridor.  LAURIE Rorschach!  Is that you??  He turns and holds up a finger: one moment, please.  Then, calm and dispassionate, he enters the MEN's room.  DREIBERG and LAURIE stand at the end of the corridor, mildly boggled.  LAURIE What's he doing?  DREIBERG I think he's going to the john.  LAURIE My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --  Before she can finish, RORSCHACH reemerges, wiping his hands on a paper towel.  He wanders up to join them without so much as a "howdy."  DREIBERG . . . That was quick.  RORSCHACH Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd. (beat) Let's get out of here.  CUT TO:  199. EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT A well-concealed RUNWAY somewhere in the heart of the Rocky Mountains.  LIGHTS sweep the sky as GROUND CREWS run to and fro.  Air Force One is coming in for a landing.  200. INT. UNDERGROUND COMMAND BUNKER - A MOMENT LATER Lots of activity: armed troops, top brass, and technicians milling about.  Flashing panels on the walls read DEFCON 2.  SECRETARY OF STATE LIDDY watches as a METAL DOOR clangs shut, and what looks like a GOLF CART comes toodling around a long metal ramp.  PRESIDENT NIXON's in the passenger seat, and there's an imposing pile of LUGGAGE in the back.  He appears to be contemplating a long stay.  PRESIDENT NIXON Hello, Gordon.  Have you seen Pat?  SECRETARY LIDDY She's all settled in.  They want you down in the command room right away.  LIDDY hops aboard, and the golf cart turns down a seemingly endless corridor which leads deep into the bowels of the Rockies.  SECRETARY LIDDY (cont.) Weatherman says we're lookin' good.  We've got a fourteen-hour window.  PRESIDENT NIXON Fourteen hours, huh?  SECRETARY LIDDY Fourteen hours.  Unless of course the reds decide to hit us first.  CUT TO:  201. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT LAURIE's following the Watchmen press coverage on an overhead screen . . .  NEWSCASTER -- in a daring midnight jailbreak.  Earlier eyewitness reports place the one-time superheroes at a peace rally in --  . . . while DREIBERG and RORSCHACH sit side-by-side at the control console, occupied by other matters.  DREIBERG I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.  RORSCHACH Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.  DREIBERG What new information?  RORSCHACH Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . (scratching his chin)  Strange that no one's tried to attack you, Daniel.  There's an unmistakable tone of suspicion in his voice.  DREIBERG, highly offended, shoots him a look of supreme resentment.  DREIBERG I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.  LAURIE Will you two lovebirds keep it down?  Still grumbling at each other, DREIBERG and RORSCHACH glance up at the monitor LAURIE's watching.  The face of ADRIAN VEIDT fills the screen:  NEWSCASTER . . . The man behind the Watchmen, high-tech wizard Adrian Veidt, was unavailable for comment.  A spokesman claimed he had left for the Antarctic to study a mysterious hole in the ozone layer.  RORSCHACH "Ozone layer"?  DREIBERG (rolling his eyes) Christ.  Couldn't he just admit that he's scared??  CUT TO:  202. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT The last rays of sunlight bleed toward endless frozen plains of pristine white.  A private AIRCRAFT descends toward an incongrous strip of black, part of a massive complex of buildings centered around what looks like a NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  (In fact, it is one.)  This is Karnak -- VEIDT's Antarctic retreat.  203. INT. KARNAK - NIGHT The entry hall is vast and lavish, appointed in the same Egyptian style as his urban pyramid -- but on a grander scale.  A fur-clad figure enters in a flurry of SNOW, followed by a genetically-altered LYNX on the end of a leash; FOUR ASIAN LACKEYS appear to greet him. One of them takes his parka; a second serves him hot coffee from a silver tray; a third takes the leash, and brushes snow from the back of the lynx.  Number four is in charge of protocol.  LACKEY Welcome, sir.  We did not expect you so soon.  VEIDT Feed Bubastis.  I'll have dinner when I've looked in on the world.  They hear and obey.  Two of them fall in behind VEIDT and follow him to:  204. INT. INFORMATION CENTER - NIGHT The room is empty but for a single chair, with a complicated REMOTE-CONTROL KEYPAD mounted on the armrest.  Across from the chair, RED VELVET CURTAINS hang from ceiling to floor.  VEIDT takes a seat, and his LACKEYS draw back the curtains to reveal a towering WALL OF TELEVISIONS -- 200 monitors in a 10x20 grid, picking up transmissions from all over the world.  It's far more informational than the human mind could possibly digest at one gulp, a hectic jumble of color and motion.  VEIDT loves it.  He settles in and his eyes begin to rove.  205. ANGLE ON VIDEO WALL PANNING across transmissions of every variety -- commercials, sitcoms, sportscasts -- we settle on a screen labelled "LONDON." VEIDT hits the volume button on his remote, and a NEWSCASTER'S VOICE comes up.  On the wall behind her is a civil defense logo . . .  BBC NEWSCASTER -- best situated in a cellar room, as far away from windows as possible.  Cinderblock walls are preferred, but a makeshift shelter can be constructed of sandbags, or of boxes filled with --  FLICK, and the sound dies.  VEIDT's gaze drifts several screens to the right, to the monitor labelled "WASHINGTON D.C."  Sound up:  NEWSCASTER -- amid rumors that top-ranking officials and military personnel have already been relocated to underground bunkers.  White House spokesmen insist that no such precautions have yet been taken and that ongoing negotiations --  FLICK: sound down.  Now we shift to a closed-circuit monitor at the bottom right of the bank -- an exterior view of VEIDT's antarctic retreat as seen by a surveillance camera.  FLICK: same subject, new angle.  FLICK: a RADAR SCREEN, which shows no activity; the skies are clear.  FLICK --  -- and now things get downright weird.  Because all at once we're watching DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN, the earnest you scientist from twenty-some years ago; he's sitting at a table in the Gila Flas canteen, across from JANEY SLATER, and he's getting ready to propose.  206. REVERSE ANGLE - ON VEIDT eyeing young Osterman with a strange, grave smile.  CUT TO:  207. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT LOW ANGLE on the Owlship as it descends slowly through the clouds. On its underbelly, a VIDEO CAMERA grinds and rotates.  208. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT DREIBERG and LAURIE watch a monitor which shows an overhead view of the city.  He punches up a series of PROGRESSIVE MAGNIFICATIONS, gradually zeroing in on a single city block.  It's been cordoned off, POLICE BUBBLE-CARS are parked up and down its length.  DREIBERG They've got my building surrounded. (looking up at her) They must've been following you all along.  She stares at him.  The ship LURCHES as DREIBERG kicks in the accelerator jets and takes off into the clouds.  DREIBERG (cont.) So much for Dan Dreiberg, ordinary citizen.  LAURIE Welcome back, Night Owl.  DREIBERG What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?  RORSCHACH CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.  DREIBERG What do you mean, frame-up?  RORSCHACH Obvious pattern -- all ties in --  DREIBERG Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us? (spreading his hands) What about all those poor shits with cancer?  TIGHT ON LAURIE, who's listening to all this with mounting distress.  RORSCHACH How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .  DREIBERG Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --  LAURIE (interrupting him) It's not.  RORSCHACH Not what?  LAURIE Not "propaganda." (pause; then, blurting it out --) Christ, I'm one of them!  I've got it.  DREIBERG swivels abruptly in his chair and gapes at LAURIE, his face bone-white.  She stares at the floor, afraid to meet his eyes, her grim secret revealed.  For an awkward moment neither of them can think of anything to say.  Then RORSCHACH, his mind already back on the "case," breaks the silence.  RORSCHACH Hnrrr -- changes everything.  Let's get moving.  209. EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT RORSCHACH is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse; he pries off a couple of loose slats and digs around, swatting angrily at a RAT which scampers out of the hole.  The OWLSHIP hovers above.  210. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT DREIBERG, disconsolate, holds LAURIE gently by the shoulders.  LAURIE I should've told you, Dan.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted things between us to be -- happy.  For a while.  I --  DREIBERG It doesn't change a thing, Laurie.  I love you.  He tries to pull her close but she turns away, her eyes welling up with tears.  LAURIE I love you too, Dan, I -- why don't you give me a minute to get myself together, okay?  211. EXT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A distraught DREIBERG descends the rope ladder from the OWLSHIP. RORSCHACH has uncovered a spare blot-mask; with a hiss of satisfaction he pulls it on over his head.  When he turns, he sees DREIBERG staring slack-jawed at an inexplicable sight.  Above their heads, the OWLSHIP has begun to glow -- BRIGHT BLUE.  212. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT LAURIE backs against the control panel as an iridescent blue corona resolves itself into the figure of DR. MANHATTAN.  LAURIE Jon.  What are you doing here?  DR. MANHATTAN I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.  LAURIE Collect me?  DR. MANHATTAN In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .  LAURIE Jon, no -- I can't --  DR. MANHATTAN It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.  DREIBERG's frantically climbing the ladder.  He pokes his head inside the cockpit just in time to see LAURIE reaching out for DR. MANHATTAN's hand.  DREIBERG LAURIE!  DON'T --  Hands touch.  A shimmering blue halo surrounds DR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE, and the two of them DISSOLVE.  Stunned, DREIBERG clambers aboard.  There's obviously nothing he can do.  RORSCHACH is only a second or two behind them.  RORSCHACH Where's Laurie?  DREIBERG I don't think she's coming with us.  DISSOLVE TO:  213. EXT. MARS - NIGHT A BLUE SLIT opens in the sky, mere inches above the Martian surface;  DR. MANHATTAN steps placidly through, and a moment later LAURIE tumbles out behind him.  She takes a couple of halting steps, then GASPS SOUNDLESSLY -- and PITCHES FORWARD onto the shifting red sands.  DR. MANHATTAN's gone several paces before he realizes there's a problem.  Eventually, though, he turns -- and spots LAURIE clawing at the air, trying and failing to draw a breath.  He walks patiently back and extends his hand;  LAURIE grabs it, and is magically surrounded by a HALO OF OXYGEN.  DR. MANHATTAN The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.  LAURIE Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --  Ignoring her, he turns.  She hurries to keep pace with him.  Then she stops in her tracks.  Before her, in the distance, looms DR. MANHATTAN's new abode: a PALACE OF GLASS, vast and resplendent, towering over the barren sands.  At its heart stands a gargantuan, ruby-colored HOURGLASS, surrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets, spires and pendulums . . . the guts of a clock, transfigured into a shimmering crystalline castle.  DR. MANHATTAN I live here now.  He strides placidly forward.  LAURIE, boggled, stumbles along after him.  CUT TO:  214. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT TIGHT ON the distraught DREIBERG, his pained face illuminated by the glow of the instrument panel.  RORSCHACH sits calmly behind him.  RORSCHACH Heading south.  What's the plan?  DREIBERG We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.  RORSCHACH Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --  DREIBERG (exploding) Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.  RORSCHACH Coward.  Giving up.  DREIBERG SHUT UP, Rorschach.  RORSCHACH settles back, lets out a soft, thoughtful HISS.  RORSCHACH Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that. (pause) Sorry about Laurie.  DREIBERG (choked voice) Okay, let's just . . . thank you.  For a few moments they fly on in silence.  RORSCHACH can't leave well enough alone.  Deep in thought, he scratches his chin.  RORSCHACH Veidt's not stupid.  Could have angle.  -- Might be good move.  CUT TO:  215. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT LAURIE follows DR. MANHATTAN up a ruby-crystal stairway which spirals around the exterior of his great glass castle.  Off to her side, the enormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are SHIFTING, MESHING -- like the quartz movement of a fine Swiss watch.  LAURIE This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?  DR. MANHATTAN Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.  LAURIE You -- you know about me and Dan?  He gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level.  DR. MANHATTAN Time is the key, Laurie.  If I can unlock the origins of time, I'll finally be able to reconcile quantum physics and relativity.  LAURIE looks at him crosseyed -- and heaves a sigh.  LAURIE Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about? (flustered) Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.  DR. MANHATTAN (startled) Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?  LAURIE Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.  DR. MANHATTAN That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses. (nodding) We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.  She GROANS in frustration as they reach a balcony near the pinnacle of the huge glass tower.  The Martian plains spread out for miles below them; above, the stars stretch to infinity.  A chill, violent WIND whips across their faces.  DR. MANHATTAN I'll be here for the next year or so.  Then I'm going to work my way out toward the edge of the universe. (staring out at the landscape) Utterly uncorrupted by man.  Isn't it beautiful?  She moves to the edge of the balcony, gazes off at the bleak and fissured Martian surface.  Suddenly she feels very alone -- and frightened.  LAURIE Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?  DR. MANHATTAN Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.  LAURIE Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.  DR. MANHATTAN I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.  LAURIE But you knew that I'd -- die.  DR. MANHATTAN Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . . (pause) You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.  LAURIE's blood runs cold as she realizes what he's telling her.  LAURIE Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.  DR. MANHATTAN (nodding) Always.  Ever since the day I died.  He walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the forbidding Martian landscape.  Behind him, LAURIE buries her face in her hands.  DR. MANHATTAN (cont.) Do you understand me, Laurie?  Do you see what it's been like for me these last years?  Knowing that everything I knew and loved would be destroyed . . . and that by leaving Earth, I would be the helpless agent of its destruction?  LAURIE (sobbing) Then why don't you . . . do something about it!  DR. MANHATTAN Because --  LAURIE Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot. (angrily) Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?  DR. MANHATTAN I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.  That about tears it for LAURIE.  She storms over and grabs him by the shoulders:  LAURIE I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.  DR. MANHATTAN Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone. (reaching for her hand) You're the last human being I'll ever see.  CUT TO:  216. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT The OWLSHIP streaking through the icy stratosphere above the south Atlantic.  Suddenly it BOUNCES in midair -- JERKS to the right -- and begins to SPIRAL DOWNWARD into the clouds . . .  217. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT DREIBERG is frantically throwing switches as they lurch to and fro. Finally he manages to get the ship righted.  RORSCHACH's taken a bad tumble; he picks himself up off the cabin floor and asks:  RORSCHACH What happened?  DREIBERG The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.  RORSCHACH What caused it?  DREIBERG Don't know.  Nothing I can think of -- (apprehensively) -- outside of a nuclear blast.  DISSOLVE TO:  218. EXT. ANTARCTICA - KARNAK - NIGHT VEIDT'S VAST COMPLEX is little more than a DIM GLOW, barely visible through a SWIRLING BLIZZARD.  219. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT VEIDT sits before his VIDEO WALL, sipping mulled wine from a goblet.  Almost simultaneously, two SCREENS -- labeled �MOSCOW� and �WASHINGTON, D.C.� -- go to SUDDEN BLINDING WHITE.  A second later, the screens show nothing but RANDOM VIDEO NOISE.  VEIDT leans back in his chair and cocks an eyebrow, seemingly unperturbed.  220. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT The OWLSHIP streaks downward through a TOTAL WHITEOUT.  221. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT Through the cockpit, KARNAK�s visible -- for an instant.  Then, it�s lost in the snows again.  DREIBERG I�m taking her down. (frantically throwing switches) Radar�s blown.  I�ll have to wing it.  Strap in, Rorschach --  The SHIP ROCKS with the force of a premature IMPACT.  222. EXT. ANTARCTICA - ON OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT The OWLSHIP takes a HARD BOUNCE against the snow.  The hull CRUMPLES as the craft TIPS SIDEWAYS and plows into a DEEP DRIFT.  A HATCH springs open, and DREIBERG and RORSCHACH dig their way out.  They�re slightly underdressed for the weather.  Spotting the lights of KARNAK in the distance, they turn up their collars and PRESS ON.  223. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT VEIDT�s eyeing the closed-circuit SECURITY MONITOR which shows the exterior of the complex.  He spots TWO TINY FIGURES slogging through the blizzard.  As he watches, the screens for �LONDON� and �PARIS� go WHITE.  224. EXT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER DREIBERG and RORSCHACH, half-frozen and covered in frost, make it to the great metal entry doors -- and START BANGING.  A VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the door rotates into position.  A soothing, computerized WOMAN�S VOICE announces:  VOICE Welcome to Karnak.  Please identify yourself.  DREIBERG Adrian!  It�s Dreiberg.  For God�s sake open the doors.  Nothing happens.  DREIBERG POUNDS against the doors.  DREIBERG (cont.) Adrian!  We�re freezing to death out here!  He slumps to the ground exhausted, barely able to draw a breath.  The snow lies in FOUR-FOOT DRIFTS against the door.  RORSCHACH . . . He�s not coming, Daniel.  225. INT KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT On the surveillance monitor, RORSCHACH and DREIBERG shamble off.  VEIDT stands, hits his remote.  The picture dies -- leaving a mere 199 screens in operation.  The wall is now checkerboarded with monitors showing nothing but VIDEO SNOW.  As VEIDT strides calmly out of the room, �PRAGUE� goes white.  226. EXT. KARNAK - NIGHT DREIBERG on his knees, half-buried in snow.  He topples forward, unable to go on.  A PAIR OF GLOVED HANDS enter frame and YANK HIM UPWARD.  DREIBERG Can�t move . . . we�re done for.  RORSCHACH Come on.  Found an exhaust vent.  RORSCHACH drags the helpless DREIBERG around the side of the complex, where SNOW blows in flurries at the mouth of a TUNNEL-LIKE STRUCTURE.  RORSCHACH (cont.) Veidt.  It�s been Veidt all along.  He�ll pay for this.  227. INT. KARNAK - DINING HALL - NIGHT VEIDT alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall, coolly eating dinner.  Behind him, above the mammoth entry doors, hangs a TAPESTRY -- Alexander slicing through the Gordian Knot.  TWO BATTERED FIGURES creep silently into the hall.  VEIDT sits calmly, betraying nothing.  At his side, the MUTANT LYNX growls.  His hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animal's neck: quiet, girl.  RORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN FLASHER -- the same weapon CAPT. METROPOLIS used in the opening scene.  Suddenly . . .  RORSCHACH VEIDT!  VEIDT WHIRLS.  He flings a PLATTER, Frisbee-style, across the hall; it catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling.  DREIBERG backs against a wall in horror as the LYNX comes sprinting toward him, TEETH BARED.  VEIDT claps his hands twice, and the CAT relents.  He reaches for a futuristic STUN GUN, which has been lying on the table all along -- part of the place setting -- and advances on his old colleagues.  DREIBERG Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?  RORSCHACH He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.  DREIBERG Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --  VEIDT Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .  DREIBERG The missing scientists.  VEIDT Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.  RORSCHACH Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .  VEIDT Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.  228. INT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT Gun in hand, VEIDT marches them through the halls of Karnak. RORSCHACH throws an occasional glance behind him; the LYNX is nipping at his heels.  VEIDT Blake thought the Russians were trying to spirit off our researchers -- to create their own nuclear superman.  It wasn't Russia. (tapping his chest) It was me.  When he figured that out, of course I had to kill him.  The rest of it -- Rorschach's capture, my "assassination" -- that was just to keep you busy.  All that really mattered was getting rid of Dr. Manhattan.  DREIBERG What??  VEIDT I couldn't let him interfere with my project.  RORSCHACH Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.  VEIDT No.  I just hastened the inevitable. (smiling) He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.  DREIBERG Laurie?  You're responsible for --  VEIDT reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case.  He pulls out a smoke and strikes it against the box.  VEIDT (cont.) One thing I've learned about cancer -- it's much easier to generate than it is to cure.  DREIBERG, enraged, CHARGES at him.  The LYNX roars.  VEIDT swings the stun gun across DREIBERG's face, knocking him to the floor -- and LEVELS the futuristic weapon DIRECTLY AT HIS HEAD.  VEIDT Let's get something straight.  If you try that again, I'll kill you without a moment's thought.  They've reached the entrance to VEIDT's information room.  200 SCREENS blink and flicker as he waves the gun, gesturing them inside.  RORSCHACH Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.  VEIDT Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.  229. INT. INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER VEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand corner.  Onscreen, the young JON OSTERMAN sits in a lab at Gila Flats, reassembling a WATCH.  DREIBERG What is this?  It looks like Jon.  VEIDT It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.  DREIBERG Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?  VEIDT It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.  CUT TO:  230. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT DR. MANHATTAN peers off the edge of a balcony while, behind him, LAURIE dines at a sumptuously appointed table.  She feels as if she's hit the jackpot in some freakish contest -- Win A Dream Date On Mars.  DR. MANHATTAN I almost envy you, Laurie.  In my present form I can't die.  It's a mystery I'd like to penetrate.  LAURIE Jon, I do not want to hear it.  DR. MANHATTAN I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .  LAURIE (shaking her head) Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.  DR. MANHATTAN You're the only human being I care for.  LAURIE Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit. (pause) I want you to cure me.  DR. MANHATTAN I won't do that.  LAURIE You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.  DR. MANHATTAN I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.  LAURIE Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.  Eyes wild, she GRABS his great blue HAND -- and THRUSTS IT into her chest, where it DISAPPEARS UP TO THE WRIST.  Her fingers tighten around his forearm.  Their GAZES LOCK.  DR. MANHATTAN shuts his eyes and grimaces, as if he's got to make the hardest decision of his life.  And then . . .  A BRILLIANT BLUE AURA engulfs them both.  It SPREADS and GROWS IN INTENSITY, suffusing the sky, finally BLOTTING OUT the vast Martian landscape altogether.  With a sudden POP the aura begins to die.  For a split-second we see the figures of LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN suspended against a great white VOID.  Then colors begin to appear; the crystal castle and the Martian desert gradually materialize around them.  The two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like statues, awestruck.  Neither one seems quite sure what's happened.  LAURIE What -- am I --  DR. MANHATTAN Cured, yes.  Utterly spent, he staggers to the edge of the balcony, grabs a handrail for support.  He looks like a man who's just had a heart attack.  LAURIE Jon, what is it?  What's the matter?  When he looks up at her, he's DESOLATE -- his face filled with DREAD.  DR. MANHATTAN Something. . .incomprehensible has happened.  It's all gone blank on me.  -- I can't remember the future.  Slowly -- very slowly -- she draws near and puts her arms around him.  LAURIE Jon.  Let's go back to Earth.  CUT TO:  231. INT. KARNAK - LAB AREA - NIGHT VEIDT, DREIBERG, and RORSCHACH enter a lab space which puts the I.F. room at Gila Flats to shame.  In the midst of the massive whirring machinery sits a GLOWING BLUE DOME -- a BUBBLE of PURE ENERGY.  Inside its shimmering contours is a little corner of GILA FLATS.  JON OSTERMAN tightens a screw, and sets the movement of JANEY's watch into its brass housing -- totally oblivious to the strange trio watching him from twenty-four years in the future.  VEIDT Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes. (pause) Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.  DREIBERG What is it?  How does it work?  VEIDT It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time. (smiling) There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --  DREIBERG Adrian -- you've lost it.  VEIDT (pointing at the tachyon bubble) I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. (pause)  In some of them -- only a few -- the human race survives.  And it survives because Dr. Manhattan never existed.  He draws closer to the tachyon bubble.  Off to one side is the CAMERA which feeds the monitor in the VIDEO ROOM -- and beside it, mounted on a tripod, is a HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPIC RIFLE.  VEIDT (cont.) The creation of Dr. Manhattan was a flashpoint in history.  He threw the world balance of power totally out of whack.  And his absence -- for even a week -- virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war. (wild-eyed) Do you understand now?  Do you see what I�m going to do?  I�m going to change the past!  232. EXT. OUTER SPACE - THAT MOMENT DR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE materialize in orbit around the earth, enveloped in a BUBBLE OF OXYGEN.  Far below, the nuclear birds are already aloft; TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT flash over New York and San Francisco.  LAURIE We�re too late.  DR. MANHATTAN It�s very strange.  Time�s flowing backwards . . .  LAURIE Jon -- what??  DR. MANHATTAN The south pole.  Time�s flowing backwards.  233. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT Inside the tachyon chamber, JON OSTERMAN fits the glass crystal back into place on JANEY�s watch.  VEIDT looks on in fascination.  VEIDT At first we could only watch the past.  Now we can reach out and touch it.  He steps over to the rifle, peers through the telescopic sight.  VEIDT It ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half -- but last week I managed to open a dime-sized hole for almost three seconds. (turning to face them) In a minute I�ll do it again.  And if my aim is true, I�ll put a bullet through Jon Osterman�s heart . . . and Dr. Manhattan will never be born.  DREIBERG and RORSCHACH trade looks of disbelief.  RORSCHACH . . . And they call me a fucking nut.  DREIBERG Adrian.  It�s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.  VEIDT Don�t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won�t even be here, will we?  DREIBERG And what if you�re wrong?  VEIDT I�m not.  DREIBERG What if you�re wrong??  VEIDT Then I�ve been a very bad boy and you�ll have to spank me.  Christ! (shouting) I�m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!  234. EXT. ANTARCTICA - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT A POCKET OF BLUE HAZE materializes in the snow-swept skies above KARNAK.  Inside it: LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN.  DR. MANHATTAN That�s it.  That�s the source of the time disturbance.  LAURIE Jon, where are we?  DR. MANHATTAN Veidt�s complex.  235. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT  Twenty-four years ago, JON OSTERMAN is packing his jeweler�s tools, folding his swatch of black velvet.  In the present, VEIDT is raving:  VEIDT Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.  DREIBERG You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?  VEIDT We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.  He kicks a floor switch.  GIANT NUCLEAR GENERATORS begin to hum. Then he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight.  236. VEIDT'S POV - THROUGH CROSSHAIRS In the past, JON OSTERMAN is reaching for his lab coat when he hears a SQUEAK.  He picks up a broom . . .  237. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT A LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon bubble.  There's a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up --  DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEIDT'S RIFLE.  His finger closes around the trigger . . .  . . . and with a TERRIBLE CRASH, the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM. VEIDT DIVES BACKWARD, DODGING RUBBLE . . .  . . . as a BLUE GIANT, THIRTY FEET TALL, steps into the lab -- with LAURIE at his side.  DR. MANHATTAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?  VEIDT Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.  DR. MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees himself -- his former self -- chasing a MOUSE out of the I.F. chamber at Gila Flats.  His eyes go wide.  Even he's surprised.  In the ensuing panic, DREIBERG dives at VEIDT.  VEIDT manages to sidestep him, frantically trying to get to his rifle.  The HOLE IN THE BUBBLE has grown to the size of a quarter.  VEIDT lunges toward the rifle.  LAURIE's directly in his path.  He shoves her aside; they grapple; he flings her to the ground and points his STUN GUN directly at her --  -- and a millisecond later, he�s aiming at NOTHING.  DR. MANHATTAN has instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room, out of his line of fire.  VEIDT looks up in horror, just in time to see a BLUE BOLT OF LIGHTNING launching itself from DR. MANHATTAN�s outstretched finger --  VEIDT NO!!!!  -- and in the wink of an eye, he�s VAPORIZED.  All that�s left is a pair of CHARRED BOOTS, still standing upright.  DREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE, takes her in his arms.  LAURIE What was he doing?  DREIBERG Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --  DR. MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYON BUBBLE, mesmerized.  Inside, the door to the I.F. chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN.  DR. MANHATTAN He was right.  RORSCHACH, LAURIE, and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement.  DR. MANHATTAN begins to shrink to normal size.  He runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble; BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all directions.  DR. MANHATTAN He did it.  Veidt broke the code.  It�s so elegant.  It�s so obvious.  DR. MANHATTAN�s off in another world, as usual.  He wears a BEATIFIC SMILE as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber.  LAURIE Jon --  DR. MANHATTAN Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.  LAURIE Jon -- for God�s sake, what do you see?  DR. MANHATTAN I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!  He lifts his arms; PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz around his body like superaccelerated fireflies.  The lights in the room dim; it's as if DR. MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the world into his own massive frame.  DR. MANHATTAN My work here is finished . . .  The others cower.  They sense that something large is about to happen.  In the past, JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the test chamber; in the present, DR. MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the tiny hole in time.  He does, and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS into a SHIMMERING FISSURE.  DR. MANHATTAN PEELS BACK ITS EDGES AND STEPS THROUGH . . . INTO THE PAST.  238. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT JON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel.  To his utter bewilderment, a HUGE BLUE FIGURE -- surrounded by sparks and smiling gloriously -- has materialized in the chamber behind him.  DR. MANHATTAN Don't be afraid, Jon.  I'll be here with you.  A second before the particle cannons kick in, DR. MANHATTAN steps forward -- and FUSES WITH JON, their bodies becoming one.  For a moment JON is still visible, with DR. MANHATTAN's frame surrounding him, like a translucent shield of pure energy; then DR. MANHATTAN coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him.  As the chamber begins to glow, a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across the shell of his body.  BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams; he spreads his hands -- no in pain, but in triumph; and with a blinding FLASH, DR. MANHATTAN explodes outward, a million fragments merging with nothingness . . .  . . . to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place.  The blue light dims and the chamber reverts to normal.  Miraculously, he's alive -- astonished, but perfectly intact.  239. INT. GILA FLATS TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER The timelocked door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of his awed colleagues, who've seen everything through the observation panel.  SCIENTIST What in the name of God . . .  The SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber.  JANEY, sobbing, rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON.  As she clings to him, her face pressed tightly against his chest, he looks down at his hands; his fist is still closed around . . .  JON Your watch, Janey.  I fixed your watch --  SCIENTIST II LOOK!!  The SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear wall of the chamber . . . which isn't there.  Instead, there's a rippling, irregular RUPTURE -- a pulsating HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyond it are three odd-looking and very frightened figures: DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH.  240. REVERSE ANGLE - VEIDT'S LAB - THE PRESENT DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the astounded SCIENTISTS.  LAURIE What happened -- ?  DREIBERG He saved himself.  He changed the past.  LAURIE Where did he go?  Before DREIBERG can suggest an answer, the cleft in time begins to THROB and SHIMMER, slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes.  For a moment everything's back to normal --  -- and then, to their mounting horror, the room they're in begins to DISSOLVE AROUND THEM . . . FADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID.  A sudden percussive POP.  The white void seems to shrivel around them, collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge into . . .  241. EXT. VORTEX EFFECT DREIBERG, LAURIE and RORSCHACH spinning and tumbling through an otherdimensional funhouse of sound and color.  If space and time could be compressed into a single extravagant E-ticket joyride, this would be it.  Their bodies contract and distend, warp and elongate; their tortured mouths emit soundless shrieks; and then, before they know it, they find themselves deposited --  242. EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT -- smack in the middle of a busy intersection.  The three of them materialize from nowhere; a southbound VAN swerves to avoid them, slamming into a row of parked cars, and a northbound TAXICAB does the same, knocking over a fire hydrant.  LAURIE Dan, is this -- is this New York??  DREIBERG Those cars.  What year is this??  LAURIE Everything's changed --  It's a disorienting world they've landed in.  In fact, it's our world, our New York, and everything -- the cars, the clothing, the very look of the city -- seems just a trifle out of whack . . .  RORSCHACH Hnrrrrr -- we never happened.  BYSTANDERS cluster about, laughing and taunting, highly amused by the obvious puzzlement of the freakish trio in their midst.  There are, of course, no costumed heroes in our world, and their sudden presence prompts a Babel of speculation among the onlookers: Nuts?  Fruits?  Out-of-work actors?  RORSCHACH takes a swing at one of the curious, who gets a touch too close, and the mood begins to turn hostile.  The CROWD, now grown to several dozen people, is threatening to block the intersection altogether; a MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides up on his stallion and blows a shrill WHISTLE.  DREIBERG Oh my God, they still ride around on horses!  243. EXT. NEWSSTAND - THAT MOMENT The same newsstand we've seen all along -- but luckily, here in our world, the headlines are only mildly discouraging: "RUSSIAN SUMMIT TALKS COLLAPSE."  Like everyone else, our old friend the NEWS VENDOR is gapin at the ruckus on the street.  NEWS VENDOR Jesus Christ, it must be Halloween.  His sidekick, the small black KID who reads comic books, points to the befuddled trio on the street and LAUGHS in gleeful recognition.  KID Shit, man!  It's Rorschach!  And Night Owl!  NEWS VENDOR What are you talkin' about?  KID Superheroes!  Check it out!  He thrusts a COMIC BOOK into the NEWS VENDOR's hand and races off to join the growing throng of rubberneckers.  The NEWS VENDOR stares down at the costumed characters in the comic book -- "WATCHMEN" -- then throws a cockeyed squint at their real-life counterparts on the street.  KID All right!  They must be on a case.  244. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT HORNS BLARE.  ALL TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED.  The intersection is mobbed with curious ONLOOKERS.  By now a half-dozen BEAT COPS have arrived to clear the streets and restore order.  COP I Break it up!  Stand back!  COP II Come on, you three.  If this is some kind of publicity stunt --  DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH have fallen into a tight circle. They don't know what to expect and they're poised for a brawl.  The taunting crowd gives them plenty of room; even the COPS are hesitant to advance.  LAURIE Dan -- what do we do now?  DREIBERG (panicked) Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --  LAURIE We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't they -- ?  RORSCHACH They'd better.  And on RORSCHACH's final vicious HISS, we SHOCK CUT TO BLACK and  FADE OUT.  THE END1Embed;

I Believe In You And Me - Film Version;Whitney Houston;pop;You never know -Nickle-What's up! Do you guys have any favorite songs off your own album? Premier--My favorite is "U Looz" and "You Should Know"Premier, any truth to the rumors that you produced a song for 2Pac Shakur while he was signed to Death Row Records? Premier--I never Produced with 2Pac but I have a song for whenever I need to use it on Acapella. One day It will come out when I put a beat to itRoyce, who was your biggest inspiration growing up? There were many.. Cool J was a huge one -Nickle-Premo & Royce. First off, thanks so much for working together and breathing some life into hip hop. A couple questions: 1) what's a short back story as to how you guys linked up to doing Phryme 2) what was the biggest challenge working together? (Logistics, scheduling, styles) 3) Were you surprised that this happened? It's been a long time since the release of "Boom" Thanks again!  Premier-- 1. Mike Herrard who works at Shady brought the idea to us for a Slaughterhouse EP of 5 songs...After scheduling everyone was taking too long, Royce and I decided to do it together and that turned it into a full LP 2. The biggest challenge for me was Producing a full LP with ONLY sampling Adrian Younge's catalog of music. But Royce convinced me to give it a chance. I am happy that I took the chance to do something different. Now we have PRhyme December 9th. 2 3. I'm not surprised, "STREET HOP" was supposed to kind be a full LP but we have made it nowWho do you think will have a better showing at Ether on Saturday, Bizzy Bone or Cassidy? (Yes, Bizzy Bone is now on the card, opponent ain't been announced) Any info that you can share about Total Slaughter 2? If it going to happen? Who some names that might be on the show? Why y'all let Joe put the mic down though? Lol I dunno who will do better. i'm a fan of both guys.. Total Slaughter is definitely happening again.. I just got real busy with PRhyme.. I didn't let Joe put the mic down lol he did that on his own -Nickle-What was it like when you found out that your music was going to be featured in Grand Theft Auto III? Did you have any clue that the game would become such a huge success? Also, do you have any advice for an up and coming rap group? www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGpEsjUd3Tg I had a feeling the game was gonna be huge.. I actually got a first look at it and was honored... My only advice would be to believe in yourself.. Thats most important -Nickle-Are the rumours true about your beef with Biggie? And if so what was it about? Me and Big never had beef. There was some issues regarding one of my artists Jeru The Damaja but that got taken care of  Did that all come about from One Day? Can you touch on what caused the split between yourself and Jeru? His music has never been the same without you  Premier--"One Day" did spark the controversy. I went thru the motions but all is well and me and BIG cleared it up before he died. Plus BIG was NEVER called out on that record at all. speculation can sometimes lead to the wrong point getting across. As for Jeru, he and I are totally fine. We split over a business decision. We are gonna work this year on some new stuffHow do you prepare to make an album? Take a deep breath and just start writing -Nickle-Hey Royce and Preme! Great job with the album, especially getting it done and out so quickly. Will there perhaps be a sequel? (You knew someone was going to ask.) Royce, what do you think your greatest strengths and weaknesses are as an emcee? Also, for Preme - what is the status of the other collaborations you are said to have in the works - especially the one with Pete Rock which I have been looking forward to for YEARS Premier--We have talked about doing a sequel but we will see later down the line after this one comes out. As for the Pete Rock Album, we are doing a single in January to start the project. He is producing half of it and I am doing the other halfEh Prem! Why dont rap producers remix ish anymore? What can we do to bring the remix back? Word Right? I've done a few for Sam Smith and I did a Disclosure Remix for "Latch"....We will be dropping some PRhyme Remixes with special guestsIs there an album that you feel influenced you time & time again? Life after Death.. It was Written and The BlueprintPreemo! I'm an 80's baby, born/raised in NY (Queens!) and so I'm a huge fan of that grimey, gritty, heavy bass beats that were prevalent back in the 90's. My question is, do you think that kind of sound will ever make a come back? Or do you think that particular sound had its time and it's no longer as relevant in today's hip hop culture? Shit ! that's what I still do. There should be hundreds more of me doing the same thing. There's no excuse to ignore the sound of New York and you come from the birthplace of Hip Hop Culture. Do what you love, not what is trendingCan we expect more PRhyme after this album? Well whats crazy is that we have the option to do whatever so we're keeping that option ope -Nickle-Two questions - 1. I know you're planning to tour in support of this album - Any idea on when dates will be posted? (and will there be an STL one?) 2. Question for Royce - Will there be a Bar Exam 4? (please say yes.) 1. The tour dates will be posted VERY soon. As in days. Lol 2. Working on a lot now but I'll never rule out a Bar Exam 4. -Nickel You better come back to Australia! Dec 9th, we'll be announcing dates and routing.. as far as BE4... I'd LOVE TO! hahaha -Nickle-  Premier-- 1. yes we will tour February. Still working out the datesRoyce, who was your idol growing up? Sugar Ray Leonard -Nickle-Royce, did anyone get their ass beat for misspelling your legal name on the back cover of Death Is Certain? Nah lol -NIckle-  Royce, how has working with Eminem now changed from how it was back in the Slim Shady LP days? We've both grown as people and as artists so we push each other a little more lyrically these days -Nickle-When is glasshouse coming out? 2015 fa sure -Nickle-Premier? Why don't you open a club in Houston? I have one for you already. Lee Van Richardson Lee Van ?????? What's up man...I'm not the club business guy. It would have to make sense on a business level for me to do that. I wouldn't count it out but the numbers etc. would have to add up. R.I.P. Keith Bowdre....Loving your style as of late Royce! Any chance you tour up to Canada? Thank you and absolutely -Nickle-Royce, big fan, I've been listening since the Bar Exam Days lol...anyway who is the funniest member of Slaughterhouse? They're all pretty funny guys -Nickle-DJ Premier: What's it like working with Royce? Royce: What's it like working with Premo? (Loved Vegas, you go in.) Premier--Working with Royce is always easy. He is a perfectionist and so am I. We never have a dull moment ever. Chemistry is key to great records being made and we have thatWhat's one thing no one would expect about yourself? Premier--That I am a huge Rock & RoLL fan. I know my shit and I go to many many many concerts...Genesis, Van Halen, AC/DC, Rush, Iron Maiden, The Police, Ozzy Osbourne, Motley Crue....Dj Premier, I assume you have one of the dopest record collections ever. What are some of your personal favorite vinyls you own? Premier-- My David Axelrod LP's, all of my Jackson 5 Albums, James Brown, Parliament, Ohio Players, Curtis Mayfield, Al Green, Willie Hutch, Aretha Franklin, Luther Vandross, MAZE, Minnie Ripperton, Earth, Wind & Fire, Barry White, Henry Mancini, sooooooomany more...Royce you're the man! Any chance we hear a Truth or Truth Part 2 before Slaughterhouse's next album? We've done a few in that chamber since -Nickle-What's the worst job you've ever had? I worked at 7-11, Oil Dispatch and a department store all at the same time -Nickle-Are you still working on Christina Aguilera's new album? If so, what can you tell us about the tracks? I just sent her some new tracks. I don't know what she is going to use yet. We will soon see. She's about to get married so I know that is her focus right nowHey, Ryan and Chris, I'm a big fan of Shady Records, as well as Premier's work (one of the best producers ever), so I was really looking forward to this Prhyme joint! I'm glad you decided to do this AmA. I have a few questions (I won't ask nothing about Budden lol) 1) How many videos for the album are you planning on shooting? Is it gonna be anything like 50's Animal Ambition - a video for every song? 2) Why was the Courtesy video so short? That entire track is really dope, I wish the video was longer (btw my favorite line from the song is Daddy taught me if the ass is so fat it's a fact / That if you with your ho, don't matter it's still appropriate to scope at it lol) 3) What's your favorite track on the album? (hopefully you'll both answer) (Mine's PRhyme for now, I also really like Courtesy, Wishin' and Dat Sound Good) 4) Not a question, but you two should break down some of the PRhyme tracks on Rap.Genius! Royce recently did an interview about ShadyXV with Joel and Crooked, and we would like to hear something about this project as well! I'm gonna risk sounding corny A.F. but your music is really helping me through some tough times right now Can't wait for the album to drop! Premier-- 1. We plan on shooting a video to every song on the LP 1. There is a longer version but there were parts that could not be shot to complete it in time. So we did not want to waste the footage so we released it as a commercial to set up the LP coming out for now 2. I love "Wishin", "U Looz" and "Microphone Preem". It changes by the dayWhat is your favorite track off PRhyme? Does Premo rhyme at all on the album? He speaks with his hands on the album.. Its pretty amazing... I love all of the songs.. Theyre like my kids -Nickle- Premier--I spit 2 bars on "U Looz"....Enjoy because I don't rap LOLDo you use any daw software or do you still just use an MPC sequencer? MPC Renaissance is software but the formula is the same approach as Analog. I did the entire PRhyme LP on it and it is the first album that I used it forHey Premier, I�m a huge fan! I was inspired to start producing hip-hop beats after listening to your music for a long time. Do you have any advice for upcoming producers who are starting out? Study the great ones that have a long history of greatness under their belt. You must study just like Football and Basketball players study film. This is a professional business It is fun but MUST be taken serious in order to place yourself amongst usLet me say Royce, you're my favorite rapper first off, and Preem you're my favorite DJ. Now that that's out of the way, on to the questions (for both of you guys) 1. Any tips for a young upcoming rapper? 2. What is your favorite song you've ever done? 3. Are you coming to New Jersey anytime soon? Believe in yourself is the advice i always give bro -Nickle-  Premier-- 1. Compare yourself to artist that you highly respect to see where you fit in. You should want those artists to speak your name when you put some music out I have no favorite song. I love em all If New Jersey sends for me, I am there. I play anywhereBoth of your top 5 favorite albums? Premier-- (NOT IN ORDER) 1. Eric B. & Rakim--"Paid In Full" 2. Run-DMC-"Raising Hell" 3. LL Cool J--"Radio" 4. Boogie Down Productions--"Criminal Minded" 5. Public Enemy--"Yo ! Bum Rush The Show"Preme, whats your favorite beat youve produced? Royce, what do you think is your best verse ever? Damn.. I dont think i could name one -Nickle-  Premier---I don't have a favorite beat. Too many to count. I like listening to other peoples music honestly. I make mine to put out to the universe. I love a lot of songs that I've done but not "ONE" singles out the othersPrimo! I'm a huge fan! All your tracks are amazing. If you weren't spinning for a living/passion, what would you see yourself doing? What do you think would have happened if you didn't go after your career as a DJ Man I don't really know....I love football but I got hurt on my motorcycle years ago and that pretty much ended that career. I'm blessed to do music as a professionHey what's up Royce and Preemo! Can't wait for the album to drop. Like what I've been hearing! I wanted to ask were there any artists that you wanted a feature from on the album but weren't able to get in time? Also, are there any artists that everybody should look for that are on the come up? Thanks guys! Black Thought of the ROOTS but we are getting him on the "Wishin" REMIX. His manager had just died so he was not in the mood to write and record. More Remixes coming and a 3 song Deluxe Bonus cuts comingWho are you listening to the most these days? Are there any up and comers we should be watching out for? Look out for Kid Vishis! -Nickle-Yo I can't wait to buy that PRhyme album But, how soon is Glasshouse coming out? Keep it 100, nickle I need some more slaughter! Its coming my brother! -Nickle-Is it true that Ed Sheeran came to work with you due to Christina Aguileraa Back to Basics? Why didn't your tracks make his album I worked with Ed Sheeran last year on a song called "The Manor". It is still coming outWhat is a hobby of yours that people might not expect? Boxing -Nickle-Are you still using MPCs, or have you upgraded to modern hardware? How do you think your production has changed over the years? Oh, one more thing, will you start producing MOP albums again? I am using the MPC Renaissance. It is pretty much the same ad the 60 except it is equipped with more sample time and capable of using Plug Ins from outboard gear that i still use from the 90's As for M.O.P. I am on the upcoming LP. I did 5 so far. They have an EP out now but that was just to stall while they finish recording the album. They wanted to save mine for that insteadI have been waiting for you two do be a collective since I first heard royce's hip hop. Any plans on touring and will you hit Ireland? You work amazing together just as good as gang starr was imo. Rip guru We plan to eventually hit every city,Country etc -Nickle- Premier-- The tour details are being worked out so stay tuned. But Yes we will tourPreme- you ever consider writing a book? Hip hop history stories would be dope especially stories about Big L(RIP) and other greats Royce- you gonna hop in the battle rap scene and start killing foos and throw hands? Im open to the idea -Nickle-  Premier--I am doing a book with Harry Allen helping me on it. I also want to do a proper Gang Starr Book. Stay TunedPreemo I'm a huge fan! Finally been able to start getting my name a bit more recognized as a producer and I owe a huge part of that to you as I have listened to your production religiously over the past few years My question is do you ever run into a sort of writers block when it comes to finding samples? And if you do how do you overcome this? PRhyme is amazing btw. I can't get over the beat changes on Wishin. Great stuff from both you and Royce Premier-- Yes I get writers block all of the time...You just have to go back to it with a fresh head and somehow it comes. Everyday is not meant to be the day that a song will come out great. But it finally does. Stay in your zone and shut the phones off and ignore everyone while you are creatingPremier, who would you put in your top 5 (All time)? Premier--Rakim, KRS-ONE, Chuck D, Melle Mel, Big Daddy KaneRoyce Congratulations on your sobriety! How do you do it? As someone who struggles with substances, it's a really tough fight for me. How can someone with your fame, wealth and free lifestyle manage to remain sober for that long? Do you have any tips or words of encouragement? I'd appreciate anything! Well you have to want to stop.. I reached a point in my life where i just felt it was time.. I knew i needed help and i couldn't do it on my own so i reached out to who could help me.. Admitting that youre powerless over whatever youre addiction is, is probably the biggest act of strength you could ever portrayHey just wanted to say first off you guys' album is great and its gonna be on rotation for a while. All the songs are dope and I especially love Ab-Souls feature on there. Question for premo, what was your favorite beat to make ever? My personal favorite beat of yours is probably Work or Nas Is Like I do not have a favorite beat. Too many to focus on 1 favoritePreem! Huge fan of your work, love all of your shit all the way from No More Mr Nice Guy up until PHryme, you are probably my all time favorite producer and I don't think that will ever change That being said, why you gotta break my heart all the time. You announce some amazing projects like your collabs with people like Nas, KRS One & Pete Rock but then we never hear anymore. I know the Nas project is held up by label shit but what about you and KRS or Pete? Would love to hear some info on this Also i saw you and Pete when you came to Australia for your back2back tour and it was fucking amazing. Thank you so much for that night, even though you were late! I know Pete has been talking about the fact that he wants to make a reunion album with CL since Guru passed, do you have any information on that? Thanks for blessing us with so much amazing music over the years. You truly are one of the greatest Producers of all time Guru RIP The NAS LP you are correct. He has to finish his commitments to Def Jam first. As for KRS, we did 3 songs and then he went on tour. Haven't heard from him since, but that's what KRS does so when the time is right it will happen. As for Pete Rock, we both had other commitments that had to come first so that is just how our industry goes. Don't count them out though....I still continue to put music out if you are really keeping up with mePrem, I'm a big fan of you! What do you think of J Dilla? Premier-- Dilla is my dude. we hung out together many of times. He was with me when I recorded "Devil's Pie" with D'angelo. I have the picture. This was before he was sick and Alchemist came with me....Alchemist looks like a little kid back in 1998...R.I.P. Dilla DawgAyo Preemo, when are you gonna produce for K-Rino? He's so dope but needs better production Premier--K-Rino is on the new NYGz LP. Their LP will finally get a release date in January. The song he did with us is called "Introduction To Manhood" along with Lil Fame of M.O.P....K-Rino got busy on it. He and I talked about doing an albumPreme can you tell us a good guru story none of us would have heard, and what really went down with solar? Premier--I have many stories but too much to type. As for Solar i don't want to give him any shine. He don't deserve anything coming from me so I will stay positive to avoid all negative frontsPreemo: Did any other pop/R&B singers approach you for beats after your success with Xtina's 'Back to Basics' album? Miguel, Ed Sheeran, Anthony Hamilton, Rizzle Kicks, Becky HillRoyce, PRhyme and 2014 Forest Hills Drive (J Cole) come out the same day, what you think about? I dont really think about it -Nickle-Royce and Preme- what are some of your favorite clothing brands to wear? I dont usually shop brands.. I go for looks.. I really like layering.. Im a winter and fall dresser -Nickle-Royce huge fan for a long time wanted to ask if there is any untold funny memories you can talk about the great late Proof? Too man great memories with Gawd... He was the truest -Nickle-First, I am a huge fan of both of you and thanks for doing this AMA ! With that being said do you think the bar has been set VERY high for this album with great albums already dropped this year such as RTJ2 and Ab-soul ? Yes the bar is set extremely high.. We're up for the challenge tho -Nickle-  Premier-- The bar should ALWAYS BE SET HIGH. I would NEVER want to be an "alright " artist. I strive for excellence on a super high level at all timesHow many songs did you guys record for this album? 9 -Nickle-Primo- what's your best Kanye West story? Royce- how did you wind up on I Wanna Be Bad? Hahah They reached out and asked me to be a part of it. I liked the song so i did it -Nickle-First off, great album. I loved every track and I truly enjoyed the features, ranging from Mac Miller to Jay Electronica Royce, as a fellow Detroiter (from Metro-Detroit actually, but you get what I mean), I am well aware of your love for Detroit and support for the city. Allow me to express my appreciation for that! I have a few quick questions: What's your daily routine? In other words, what's an average day for Royce da 5'9" like? Also, do you record using studios primarily in Michigan or do you prefer to record elsewhere (i.e. Los Angeles, New York)? THank you my brother.. A day for me consists of gym, studio and more studio lol... I use Mr Porters studio in OP -Nickle-Are there any unheard Big L tracks in your vault or ones that you know about? (Big L RIP) Yall gonna keep making dope ass music together? BIG L's Estate with all of his unreleased music is being worked out so for now it is on holdFavorite memory of Christina Aguilera? Premier-- My favorite memory was hanging in the studio with her, Snoop Dogg, Bishop Don Magic Juan giving her a Wedding Gift while we were recording, Flava Flav coming to her house with Warren G playing Mario Cart. She's my little sister. Love her to deathWhat would both of you say is the highlight of your careers so far? Premier--My highlight was meeting James BrownWhat happened to the songs you worked with Christina Aguilera on her Bionic album? Premier-- She decided not to use them. All good. We never recorded vocals. Just laid the tracksIf Christina Aguilera made you executive producer of her next album, what direction would you take her in and why? Premier-- Let's just say, the entire LP would be a massive hit. I would LOVE to do a whole Executive Production of getting her the best songs ever because she can fuckin sang !If you could have Christina Aguilera duet with anyone for a track you produced, who would it be and why? Mary J. Blige. Because they both have soul and not too many singers nowadays have that. Without Soul, you are just a basic singer. There is a differenceFavorite Christina Aguilera song that you worked on and favorite Christina Aguilera song that you did not work on? Premier-- My favorite Christina Aguilera song is "Back In the Day" My favorite that I did not work on is "Welcome"Hey Royce! I can't wait for your guy's new album to drop! (I'll pre-order it asap I promise ha! broke college student here!) But Every time you and Premier get together, it's a guaranteed hit. Not to mention you got many other sick artists to colab with that you haven't before. That being said, Is there a track that you enjoyed making the most or had the most fun on? I've always wondered if artists had favorite songs on their own album ha We had fun doing them all.. Never a dull moment -Nickle-What's it like working working with each other? It's amazing! Preme is one of, if not the, greatest producers ever. What's there not to love about working on an entire project with him? -NickelRoyce - what are your top three favorite albums you've made? PRhyme.. Death is Certain and Bar Exam 2 -Nickle-You might also like4Embed;
Count On Me - from "Waiting to Exhale" - Original Soundtrack;Whitney Houston;pop;You never know -Nickle-What's up! Do you guys have any favorite songs off your own album? Premier--My favorite is "U Looz" and "You Should Know"Premier, any truth to the rumors that you produced a song for 2Pac Shakur while he was signed to Death Row Records? Premier--I never Produced with 2Pac but I have a song for whenever I need to use it on Acapella. One day It will come out when I put a beat to itRoyce, who was your biggest inspiration growing up? There were many.. Cool J was a huge one -Nickle-Premo & Royce. First off, thanks so much for working together and breathing some life into hip hop. A couple questions: 1) what's a short back story as to how you guys linked up to doing Phryme 2) what was the biggest challenge working together? (Logistics, scheduling, styles) 3) Were you surprised that this happened? It's been a long time since the release of "Boom" Thanks again!  Premier-- 1. Mike Herrard who works at Shady brought the idea to us for a Slaughterhouse EP of 5 songs...After scheduling everyone was taking too long, Royce and I decided to do it together and that turned it into a full LP 2. The biggest challenge for me was Producing a full LP with ONLY sampling Adrian Younge's catalog of music. But Royce convinced me to give it a chance. I am happy that I took the chance to do something different. Now we have PRhyme December 9th. 2 3. I'm not surprised, "STREET HOP" was supposed to kind be a full LP but we have made it nowWho do you think will have a better showing at Ether on Saturday, Bizzy Bone or Cassidy? (Yes, Bizzy Bone is now on the card, opponent ain't been announced) Any info that you can share about Total Slaughter 2? If it going to happen? Who some names that might be on the show? Why y'all let Joe put the mic down though? Lol I dunno who will do better. i'm a fan of both guys.. Total Slaughter is definitely happening again.. I just got real busy with PRhyme.. I didn't let Joe put the mic down lol he did that on his own -Nickle-What was it like when you found out that your music was going to be featured in Grand Theft Auto III? Did you have any clue that the game would become such a huge success? Also, do you have any advice for an up and coming rap group? www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGpEsjUd3Tg I had a feeling the game was gonna be huge.. I actually got a first look at it and was honored... My only advice would be to believe in yourself.. Thats most important -Nickle-Are the rumours true about your beef with Biggie? And if so what was it about? Me and Big never had beef. There was some issues regarding one of my artists Jeru The Damaja but that got taken care of  Did that all come about from One Day? Can you touch on what caused the split between yourself and Jeru? His music has never been the same without you  Premier--"One Day" did spark the controversy. I went thru the motions but all is well and me and BIG cleared it up before he died. Plus BIG was NEVER called out on that record at all. speculation can sometimes lead to the wrong point getting across. As for Jeru, he and I are totally fine. We split over a business decision. We are gonna work this year on some new stuffHow do you prepare to make an album? Take a deep breath and just start writing -Nickle-Hey Royce and Preme! Great job with the album, especially getting it done and out so quickly. Will there perhaps be a sequel? (You knew someone was going to ask.) Royce, what do you think your greatest strengths and weaknesses are as an emcee? Also, for Preme - what is the status of the other collaborations you are said to have in the works - especially the one with Pete Rock which I have been looking forward to for YEARS Premier--We have talked about doing a sequel but we will see later down the line after this one comes out. As for the Pete Rock Album, we are doing a single in January to start the project. He is producing half of it and I am doing the other halfEh Prem! Why dont rap producers remix ish anymore? What can we do to bring the remix back? Word Right? I've done a few for Sam Smith and I did a Disclosure Remix for "Latch"....We will be dropping some PRhyme Remixes with special guestsIs there an album that you feel influenced you time & time again? Life after Death.. It was Written and The BlueprintPreemo! I'm an 80's baby, born/raised in NY (Queens!) and so I'm a huge fan of that grimey, gritty, heavy bass beats that were prevalent back in the 90's. My question is, do you think that kind of sound will ever make a come back? Or do you think that particular sound had its time and it's no longer as relevant in today's hip hop culture? Shit ! that's what I still do. There should be hundreds more of me doing the same thing. There's no excuse to ignore the sound of New York and you come from the birthplace of Hip Hop Culture. Do what you love, not what is trendingCan we expect more PRhyme after this album? Well whats crazy is that we have the option to do whatever so we're keeping that option ope -Nickle-Two questions - 1. I know you're planning to tour in support of this album - Any idea on when dates will be posted? (and will there be an STL one?) 2. Question for Royce - Will there be a Bar Exam 4? (please say yes.) 1. The tour dates will be posted VERY soon. As in days. Lol 2. Working on a lot now but I'll never rule out a Bar Exam 4. -Nickel You better come back to Australia! Dec 9th, we'll be announcing dates and routing.. as far as BE4... I'd LOVE TO! hahaha -Nickle-  Premier-- 1. yes we will tour February. Still working out the datesRoyce, who was your idol growing up? Sugar Ray Leonard -Nickle-Royce, did anyone get their ass beat for misspelling your legal name on the back cover of Death Is Certain? Nah lol -NIckle-  Royce, how has working with Eminem now changed from how it was back in the Slim Shady LP days? We've both grown as people and as artists so we push each other a little more lyrically these days -Nickle-When is glasshouse coming out? 2015 fa sure -Nickle-Premier? Why don't you open a club in Houston? I have one for you already. Lee Van Richardson Lee Van ?????? What's up man...I'm not the club business guy. It would have to make sense on a business level for me to do that. I wouldn't count it out but the numbers etc. would have to add up. R.I.P. Keith Bowdre....Loving your style as of late Royce! Any chance you tour up to Canada? Thank you and absolutely -Nickle-Royce, big fan, I've been listening since the Bar Exam Days lol...anyway who is the funniest member of Slaughterhouse? They're all pretty funny guys -Nickle-DJ Premier: What's it like working with Royce? Royce: What's it like working with Premo? (Loved Vegas, you go in.) Premier--Working with Royce is always easy. He is a perfectionist and so am I. We never have a dull moment ever. Chemistry is key to great records being made and we have thatWhat's one thing no one would expect about yourself? Premier--That I am a huge Rock & RoLL fan. I know my shit and I go to many many many concerts...Genesis, Van Halen, AC/DC, Rush, Iron Maiden, The Police, Ozzy Osbourne, Motley Crue....Dj Premier, I assume you have one of the dopest record collections ever. What are some of your personal favorite vinyls you own? Premier-- My David Axelrod LP's, all of my Jackson 5 Albums, James Brown, Parliament, Ohio Players, Curtis Mayfield, Al Green, Willie Hutch, Aretha Franklin, Luther Vandross, MAZE, Minnie Ripperton, Earth, Wind & Fire, Barry White, Henry Mancini, sooooooomany more...Royce you're the man! Any chance we hear a Truth or Truth Part 2 before Slaughterhouse's next album? We've done a few in that chamber since -Nickle-What's the worst job you've ever had? I worked at 7-11, Oil Dispatch and a department store all at the same time -Nickle-Are you still working on Christina Aguilera's new album? If so, what can you tell us about the tracks? I just sent her some new tracks. I don't know what she is going to use yet. We will soon see. She's about to get married so I know that is her focus right nowHey, Ryan and Chris, I'm a big fan of Shady Records, as well as Premier's work (one of the best producers ever), so I was really looking forward to this Prhyme joint! I'm glad you decided to do this AmA. I have a few questions (I won't ask nothing about Budden lol) 1) How many videos for the album are you planning on shooting? Is it gonna be anything like 50's Animal Ambition - a video for every song? 2) Why was the Courtesy video so short? That entire track is really dope, I wish the video was longer (btw my favorite line from the song is Daddy taught me if the ass is so fat it's a fact / That if you with your ho, don't matter it's still appropriate to scope at it lol) 3) What's your favorite track on the album? (hopefully you'll both answer) (Mine's PRhyme for now, I also really like Courtesy, Wishin' and Dat Sound Good) 4) Not a question, but you two should break down some of the PRhyme tracks on Rap.Genius! Royce recently did an interview about ShadyXV with Joel and Crooked, and we would like to hear something about this project as well! I'm gonna risk sounding corny A.F. but your music is really helping me through some tough times right now Can't wait for the album to drop! Premier-- 1. We plan on shooting a video to every song on the LP 1. There is a longer version but there were parts that could not be shot to complete it in time. So we did not want to waste the footage so we released it as a commercial to set up the LP coming out for now 2. I love "Wishin", "U Looz" and "Microphone Preem". It changes by the dayWhat is your favorite track off PRhyme? Does Premo rhyme at all on the album? He speaks with his hands on the album.. Its pretty amazing... I love all of the songs.. Theyre like my kids -Nickle- Premier--I spit 2 bars on "U Looz"....Enjoy because I don't rap LOLDo you use any daw software or do you still just use an MPC sequencer? MPC Renaissance is software but the formula is the same approach as Analog. I did the entire PRhyme LP on it and it is the first album that I used it forHey Premier, I�m a huge fan! I was inspired to start producing hip-hop beats after listening to your music for a long time. Do you have any advice for upcoming producers who are starting out? Study the great ones that have a long history of greatness under their belt. You must study just like Football and Basketball players study film. This is a professional business It is fun but MUST be taken serious in order to place yourself amongst usLet me say Royce, you're my favorite rapper first off, and Preem you're my favorite DJ. Now that that's out of the way, on to the questions (for both of you guys) 1. Any tips for a young upcoming rapper? 2. What is your favorite song you've ever done? 3. Are you coming to New Jersey anytime soon? Believe in yourself is the advice i always give bro -Nickle-  Premier-- 1. Compare yourself to artist that you highly respect to see where you fit in. You should want those artists to speak your name when you put some music out I have no favorite song. I love em all If New Jersey sends for me, I am there. I play anywhereBoth of your top 5 favorite albums? Premier-- (NOT IN ORDER) 1. Eric B. & Rakim--"Paid In Full" 2. Run-DMC-"Raising Hell" 3. LL Cool J--"Radio" 4. Boogie Down Productions--"Criminal Minded" 5. Public Enemy--"Yo ! Bum Rush The Show"Preme, whats your favorite beat youve produced? Royce, what do you think is your best verse ever? Damn.. I dont think i could name one -Nickle-  Premier---I don't have a favorite beat. Too many to count. I like listening to other peoples music honestly. I make mine to put out to the universe. I love a lot of songs that I've done but not "ONE" singles out the othersPrimo! I'm a huge fan! All your tracks are amazing. If you weren't spinning for a living/passion, what would you see yourself doing? What do you think would have happened if you didn't go after your career as a DJ Man I don't really know....I love football but I got hurt on my motorcycle years ago and that pretty much ended that career. I'm blessed to do music as a professionHey what's up Royce and Preemo! Can't wait for the album to drop. Like what I've been hearing! I wanted to ask were there any artists that you wanted a feature from on the album but weren't able to get in time? Also, are there any artists that everybody should look for that are on the come up? Thanks guys! Black Thought of the ROOTS but we are getting him on the "Wishin" REMIX. His manager had just died so he was not in the mood to write and record.

I Love The Lord (with Georgia Mass Choir);Whitney Houston;pop; Alarmed for the condition in which the kingdom was likely to be involved by the king's death, an endeavor to prevent the consequences, which were but too plainly foreseen, was productive of the most serious and fatal effects. The king, in his long and lingering affliction, was induced to make a will, by which he bequeathed the English crown to Lady Jane, the daughter of the duke of Suffolk, who had been married to Lord Guilford, the son of the duke of Northumberland, and was the granddaughter of the second sister of King Henry, by Charles, duke of Suffolk. By this will, the succession of Mary and Elizabeth, his two sisters, was entirely superseded, from an apprehension of the returning system of popery; and the king's council, with the chief of the nobility, the lord-mayor of the city of London, and almost all the judges and the principal lawyers of the realm, subscribed their names to this regulation, as a sanction to the measure. Lord Chief Justice Hale, though a true Protestant and an upright judge, alone declined to unite his name in favor of the Lady Jane, because he had already signified his opinion that Mary was entitled to assume the reins of government. Others objected to Mary's being placed on the throne, on account of their fears that she might marry a foreigner, and thereby bring the crown into considerable danger. Her partiality to popery also left little doubt on the minds of any, that she would be induced to revive the dormant interests of the pope, and change the religion which had been used both in the days of her father, King Henry, and in those of her brother Edward: for in all his time she had manifested the greatest stubbornness and inflexibility of temper, as must be obvious from her letter to the lords of the council, whereby she put in her claim to the crown, on her brother's decease.  When this happened, the nobles, who had associated to prevent Mary's succession, and had been instrumental in promoting, and, perhaps, advising the measures of Edward, speedily proceeded to proclaim Lady Jane Gray, to be queen of England, in the city of London and various other populous cities of the realm. Though young, she possessed talents of a very superior nature, and her improvements under a most excellent tutor had given her many very great advantages.  Her reign was of only five days' continuance, for Mary, having succeeded by false promises in obtaining the crown, speedily commenced the execution of her avowed intention of extirpating and burning every Protestant. She was crowned at Westminster in the usual form, and her elevation was the signal for the commencement of the bloody persecution which followed.  Having obtained the sword of authority, she was not sparing in its exercise. The supporters of Lady Jane Gray were destined to feel its force. The duke of Northumberland was the first who experienced her savage resentment. Within a month after his confinement in the Tower, he was condemned, and brought to the scaffold, to suffer as a traitor. From his varied crimes, resulting out of a sordid and inordinate ambition, he died unpitied and unlamented.  The changes, which followed with rapidity, unequivocally declared that the queen was disaffected to the present state of religion. Dr. Poynet was displaced to make room for Gardiner to be bishop of Winchester, to whom she also gave the important office of lord-chancellor. Dr. Ridley was dismissed from the see of London, and Bonne introduced. J. Story was put out of the bishopric of Chichester, to admit Dr. Day. J. Hooper was sent prisoner to the Fleet, and Dr. Heath put into the see of Worcestor. Miles Coverdale was also excluded from Exeter, and Dr. Vesie placed in that diocese. Dr. Tonstall was also promoted to the see of Durham. These things being marked and perceived, great heaviness and discomfort grew more and more to all good men's hearts; but to the wicked great rejoicing. They that could dissemble took no great care how the matter went; but such, whose consciences were joined with the truth, perceived already coals to be kindled, which after should be the destruction of many a true Christian.The Words and Behavior of the Lady Jane upon the Scaffold The next victim was the amiable Lady Jane Gray, who, by her acceptance of the crown at the earnest solicitations of her friends, incurred the implacable resentment of the bloody Mary. When she first mounted the scaffold, she spoke to the specators in this manner: "Good people, I am come hither to die, and by a law I am condemned to the same. The fact against the queen's highness was unlawful, and the consenting thereunto by me: but, touching the procurement and desire thereof by me, or on my behalf, I do wash my hands thereof in innocency before God, and the face of you, good Christian people, this day:" and therewith she wrung her hands, wherein she had her book. Then said she, "I pray you all, good Christian people, to bear me witness, that I die a good Christian woman, and that I do look to be saved by no other mean, but only by the mercy of God in the blood of His only Son Jesus Christ: and I confess that when I did know the Word of God, I neglected the same, loved myself and the world, and therefore this plague and punishment is happily and worthily happened unto me for my sins; and yet I thank God, that of His goodness He hath thus given me a time and a respite to repent. And now, good people, while I am alive, I pray you assist me with your prayers." And then, kneeling down, she turned to Feckenham, saying, "Shall I say this Psalm?" and he said, "Yea." Then she said the Psalm of Miserere mei Deus, in English, in a most devout manner throughout to the end; and then she stood up, and gave her maid, Mrs. Ellen, her gloves and handkerchief, and her book to Mr. Bruges; and then she untied he gown, and the executioner pressed upon her to help her off with it: but she, desiring him to let her alone, turned towards her two gentlewomen, who helped her off therewith, and also with her frowes, paaft, and neckerchief, giving to her a fair handkerchief to put about her eyes.  Then the executioner kneeled down, and asked her forgiveness, whom she forgave most willingly. Then he desired her to stand upon the straw, which doing, she saw the block. Then she said, "I pray you, despatch me quickly." Then she kneeled down, saying, "Will you take it off before I lay me down?" And the executioner said, "No, madam." Then she tied a handkerchief about her eyes, and feeling for the block, she said, "What shall I do? Where is it? Where is it?" One of the standers-by guiding her therunto, she laid her head upon the block, and then stretched forth her body, and said, "Lord, into Thy hands I commend my spirit;" and so finished her life, in the year of our Lord 1554, the twelfth day of February, about the seventeenth year of her age.  Thus died Lady Jane; and on the same day Lord Guilford, her husband, one of the duke of Northumberland's sons, was likewise beheaded, two innocents in comparison with them that sat upon them. For they were both very young, and ignorantly accepted that which others had contrived, and by open proclamation consented to take from others, and give to them.  Touching the condemnation of this pious lady, it is to be noted that Judge Morgan, who gave sentence against her, soon after he had condemned her, fell mad, and in his raving cried out continually to have the Lady Jane taken away from him, and so he ended his life.  On the twenty-first day of the same month, Henry, duke of Suffolk, was beheaded on Tower-hill, the fourth day after his condemnation: about which time many gentlemen and yeomen were condemned, whereof some were executed at London, and some in the country. In the number of whom was Lord Thomas Gray, brother to the said duke, being apprehended not long after in North Wales, and executed for the same. Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, also, very narrowly escaped.John Rogers, Vicar of St. Sepulchre's, and Reader of St. Paul's, LondonJohn Rogers was educated at Cambridge, and was afterward many years chaplain to the merchant adventurers at Antwerp in Brabant. Here he met with the celebrated martyr William Tyndale, and Miles Coverdale, both voluntary exiles from their country for their aversion to popish superstition and idolatry. They were the instruments of his conversion; and he united with them in that translation of the Bible into English, entitled "The Translation of Thomas Matthew." From the Scriptures he knew that unlawful vows may be lawfully broken; hence he married, and removed to Wittenberg in Saxony, for the improvement of learning; and he there learned the Dutch language, and received the charge of a congregation, which he faithfully executed for many years. On King Edward's accession, he left Saxony to promote the work of reformation in England; and, after some time, Nicholas Ridley, then bishop of London, gave him a prebend in St. Paul's Cathedral, and the dean and chapter appointed him reader of the divinity lesson there. Here he continued until Queen Mary's succession to the throne, when the Gospel and true religion were banished, and the Antichrist of Rome, with his superstition and idolatry, introduced.  The circumstance of Mr. Rogers having preached at Paul's cross, after Queen Mary arrived at the Tower, has been already stated. He confirmed in his sermon the true doctrine taught in King Edward's time, and exhorted the people to beware of the pestilence of popery, idolatry, and superstition. For this he was called to account, but so ably defended himself that, for that time, he was dismissed. The proclamation of the queen, however, to prohibit true preaching, gave his enemies a new handle against him. Hence he was again summoned before the council, and commanded to keep his house. He did so, though he might have escaped; and though he perceived the state of the true religion to be desperate. Heknew he could not want a living in Germany; and he could not forget a wife and ten children, and to seek means to succor them. But all these things were insufficient to induce him to depart, and, when once called to answer in Christ's cause, he stoutly defended it, and hazarded his life for that purpose.  After long imprisonment in his own house, the restless Bonner, bishop of London, caused him to be committed to Newgate, there to be lodged among thieves and murderers.  After Mr. Rogers had been long and straitly imprisoned, and lodged in Newgate among thieves, often examined, and very uncharitably entreated, and at length unjustly and most cruelly condemned by Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, the fourth day of February, in the year of our Lord 1555, being Monday in the morning, he was suddenly warned by the keeper of Newgate's wife, to prepare himself for the fire; who, being then sound asleep, could scarce be awaked. At length being raised and awaked, and bid to make haste, then said he, "IKf it be so, I need not tie my points." And so was had down, first to bishop Bonner to be degraded: which being done, he craved of Bonner but one petition; and Bonner asked what that should be. Mr. Rogers replied that he might speak a few words with his wife before his burning, but that could not be obtained of him. When the time came that he should be brought out of Newgate to Smithfield, the place of his execution, Mr. Woodroofe, one of the sheriffs, first came to Mr. Rogers, and asked him if he would revoke his abominable doctrine, and the evil opinion of the Sacrament of the altar. Mr. Rogers answered, "That which I have preached I will seal with my blood." Then Mr. Woodroofe said, "Thou art an heretic." "That shall be known," quoth Mr. Rogers, "at the Day of Judgment." "Well," said Mr. Woodroofe, "I will never pray for thee." "But I will pray for you," said Mr. Rogers; and so was brought the same day, the fourth of February, by the sheriffs, towards Smithfield, saying the Psalm Miserere by the way, all the people wonderfully rejoicing at his constancy; with great praises and thanks to God for the same. And there in the presence of Mr. Rochester, comptroller of the queen's household, Sir Richard Southwell, both the sheriffs, and a great number of people, he was burnt to ashes, washing his hands in the flame as he was burning. A little before his burning, his pardon was brought, if he would have recanted; but he utterly refused it. He was the first martyr of all the blessed company that suffered in Queen Mary's time that gave the first adventure upon the fire. His wife and children, being eleven in number, ten able to go, and one sucking at her breast, met him by the way, as he went towards Smithfield. TGhis sorrowful sight of his own flesh and blood could nothing move him, but that he constantly and cheerfully took his death with wonderful patience, in the defence and quarrel of the Gospel of Christ."The Rev. Lawrence SaundersMr. Saunders, after passing some time in the school of Eaton, was chosen to go to King's College in Cambridge, where he continued three years, and profited in knowledge and learning very much for that time. Shortly after he quitted the university, and went to his parents, but soon returned to Cambridge again to his study, where he began to add to the knowledge of the Latin, the study of the Greek and Hebrew tongues, and gave himself up to the study of the Holy Scriptures, the better to qualify himself for the office of preacher.  In the beginning of King Edward's reign, when God's true religion was introduced, after license obtained, he began to preach, and was so well liked of them who then had authority that they appointed him to read a divinity lecture in the College of Forthringham. The College of Fothringham being dissolved he was placed to be a reader in the minster at Litchfield. After a certain space, he departed from Litchfield to a benefice in Leicestershire, called Church-langton, where he held a residence, taught diligently, and kept a liberal house. Thence he was orderly called to take a benefice in the city of London, namely, All-hallows in Bread-street. After this he preached at Northhampton, nothing meddling with the state, but boldly uttering his conscience against the popish doctrines which were likely to spring up again in England, as a just plague for the little love which the English nation then bore to the blessed Word of God, which had been so plentifully offered unto them.  The queen's party who were there, and heard him, were highly displeased with him for his sermon, and for it kept him among them as a prisoner. But partly for love of his brethren and friends, who were chief actors for the queen among them, and partly because there was no law broken by hbis preaching, they dismissed him.  Some of his friends, perceiving such fearful menacing, counselled him to fly out of the realm, which he refused to do. But seeing he was with violence kept from doing good in that place, he returned towards London, to visit his flock.  In the afternoon of Sunday, October 15, 1554, as he was reading in his church to exhort his people, the bishop of London interrupted him, by sending an officer for him.  His treason and sedition the bishop's charity was content to let slip until another time, but a heretic he meant to prove him, and all those, he said, who taught and believed that the administration of the Sacraments, and all orders of the Church, are the most pure, which come the nearest to the order of the primitive Church.  After much talk concerning this matter, the bishop desired him to write what he believed of transubstantiation. Lawrence Saunders did so, saying, "My Lord, you seek my blood, and you shall have it: I pray God that you may be so baptized in it that you may ever after loathe blood-sucking, and become a better man." Upon being closely charged with contumacy, the severe replies of Mr. Saunders to the bishop, (who had before, to get the favor of Henry VIII written and set forth in print, a book of true obedience, wherein he had openly declared Queen Mary to be a bastard) so irritated him that he exclaimed, "Carry away this frenzied fool to prison."  After this good and faithful martyr had been kept in prison one year and a quarter, the bishops at length called him, as they did his fellow-prisoners, openly to be examined before the queen's council.  His examination being ended, the officers led him out of the place, and stayed until the rest of his fellow-prisoners were likewise examined, that they might lead them all together to prison.  After his excommunication and delivery over to the secular power, he was brought by the sheriff of London to the Compter, a prison in his own parish of Bread-street, at which he rejoiced greatly, both because he found there a fellow-prisoner, Mr. Cardmaker, with whom he had much Christian and comfortable discourse; and because out of prison, as before in his pulpit, he might have an opportunity of preaching to his parishioners. On the fourth of February, Bonner, bishop of London, came to the prison to degrade him; the day following, in the morning the sheriff of London delivered him to certain of the queen's guard, who were appointed to carry him to the city of Coventry, there to be burnt.  When they had arrived at Coventry, a poor shoemaker, who used to serve him with shoes, came to him, and said, "O my good master, God strengthen and comfort you." "Good shoemaker," Mr. Saunders replied, "I desire thee to pray for me, for I am the most unfit man for this high office, that ever was appointed to it; but my gracious God and dear Father is able to make me strong enough." The next day, being the eighth of February, 1555, he was led to the place of execution, in the park, without the city. He went in an old gown and a shirt, barefooted, and oftentimes fell flat on the ground, and prayed. When he was come to nigh the place, the officer, appointed to see the execution done, said to Mr. Saunders that he was one of them who marred the queen's realm, but if he would recant, there was pardon for him. "Not I," replied the holy martyr, "but such as you have injured the realm. The blessed Gospel of Christ is what I hold; that do I believe, that have I taught, and that will I never revoke!" Mr. Saunders then slowly moved towards the fire, sank to the earth and prayed; he then rose up, embraced the stake, and frequently said, "Welcome, thou cross of Christ! welcome everlasting life!" Fire was then put to the fagots, and, he was overwhelmed by the dreadful flames, and sweetly slept in the Lord Jesus.The History, Imprisonment, and Examination of Mr. John Hooper, Bishop of Worcester and GloucesterJohn Hooper, student and graduate in the University of Oxford, was stirred with such fervent desire to the love and knowledge of the Scriptures that he was compelled to move from thence, and was retained in the house of Sir Thomas Arundel, as his steward, until Sir Thomas had intelligence of his opinions and religion, which he in no case did favor, though he exceedingly favored his person and condition and wished to be his friend. Mr. Hooper now prudently left Sir Thomas' house and arrived at Paris, but in a short time returned to England, and was retained by Mr. Sentlow, until the time that he was again molested and sought for, when he passed through France to the higher parts of Germany; where, commencing acquaintance with learned men, he was by them free and lovingly entertained, both at Basel, and especially at Zurich, by Mr. Bullinger, who was his singular friend; here also he married his wife, who was a Burgonian, and applied very studiously to the Hebrew tongue.  At length, when God saw it good to stay the bloody time of the six articles, and to give us King Edward to reign over this realm, with some peace and rest unto the Church, amongst many other English exiles, who then repaired homeward, Mr. Hooper also, moved in conscience, thought not to absent himself, but seeing such a time and occasion, offered to help forward the Lord's work, to the uttermost of his ability.  When Mr. Hooper had taken his farewell of Mr. Bullinger, and his friends in Zurich, he repaired again to England in the reign of King Edward VI, and coming to London, used continually to preach, most times twice, or at least once a day. In his sermons, according to his accustomed manner, he corrected sin, and sharply inveighed against the iniquity of the world and the corrupt abuses of the Church. The people in great flocks and companies daily came to hear his voice, as the most melodious sound and tune of Orpheus' harp, insomuch, that oftentimes when he was preaching, the church would be so full that none could enter farther than the doors thereof. In his doctrine he was earnest, in tongue eloquent, in the Scriptures perfect, in pains indefatigable, in his life exemplary.  Having preached before the king's majesty, he was soon after made bishop of Gloucester. In that office he continued two years, and behaved himself so well that his very enemies could find no fault with him, and after that he was made bishop of Worcester.  Dr. Hooper executed the office of a most careful and vigilant pastor, for the space of two years and more, as long as the state of religion in King Edward's time was sound and flourishing.  After he had been cited to appear before Bonner and Dr. Heath, he was led to the Council, accused falsely of owing the queen money, and in the next year, 1554, he wrote an account of his severe treatment during near eighteen months' confinement in the Fleet, and after his third examination, January 28, 1555, at St. Mary Overy's, he, with the Rev. Mr. Rogers, was conducted to the Compter in Southwark, there to remain until the next day at nine o'clock, to see whether they would recant. "Come, Brother Rogers," said Dr. Hooper, "must we two take this matter first in hand, and begin to fry in these fagots?" "Yes, Doctor," said Mr. Rogers, "by God's grace." "Doubt not," said Dr. Hooper, "but God will give us strength;" and the people so applauded their constancy that they had much ado to pass.  January 29, Bishop Hooper was degraded and condemned, and the Rev. Mr. Rogers was treated in like manner. At dark, Dr. Hooper was led through the city to Newgate; notwithstanding this secrecy, many people came forth to their doors with lights, and saluted him, praising God for his constancy.  During the few days he was in Newgate, he was frequently visited by Bonner and others, but without avail. As Christ was tempted, so they tempted him, and then maliciously reported that he had recanted. The place of his martyrdom being fixed at Gloucester, he rejoiced very much, lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, and praising God that he saw it good to send him among the people over whom he was pastor, there to confirm with his death the truth which he had before taught them.  On February 7, he came to Gloucester, about five o'clock, and lodged at one Ingram's house. After his first sleep, he continued in prayer ujntil morning; and all the day, except a little time at his meals, and when conversing such as the guard kindly permitted to speak to him, he spent in prayer.  Sir Anthony Kingston, at one time Dr. Hooper's good friend, was appointed by the queen's letters to attend at his execution. As soon as he saw the bishop he burst into tears. WIth tender entreaties he exhorted him to live. "True it is," said the bishop, "that death is bitter, and life is sweet; but alas! consider that the death to come is more bitter, and the life to come is more sweet."  The same day a blind boy obtained leave to be brought into Dr. Hooper's presence. The same boy, not long before, had suffered imprisonment at Gloucester for confessing the truth. "Ah! poor boy," said the bishop, "though God hath taken from thee thy outward sight, for what reason He best knoweth, yet He hath endued thy soul with the eye of knowledge and of faith. God give thee grace continually to pray unto Him, that thou lose not that sight, for then wouldst thou indeed be blind both in body and soul."  When the mayor waited upon him preparatory to his execution, he expressed his perfect obedience, and only requested that a quick fire might terminate his torments. After he had got up in the morning, he desired that no man should be suffered to come into the chamber, that he might be solitary until the hour of execution.  About eight o'clock, on February 9, 1555, he was led forth, and many thousand persons were collected, as it was market-day. All the way, being straitly charged not to speak, and beholding the people, who mourned bitterly for him, he would sometimes lift up his eyes towards heaven, and look very cheerfully upon such as he knew: and he was never known, during the time of his being among them, to look with so cheerful and ruddy a countenance as he did at that time. When he came to the place appointed where he should die, he smilingly beheld the stake and preparation made for him, which was near unto the great elm tree over against the college of priests, where he used to preach.  Now, after he had entered into prayer, a box was brought and laid before him upon a stool, with his pardon from the queen, if he would turn. At the sight whereof he cried, "If you love my soul, away with it!" The box being taken away, Lord Chandois said, "Seeing there is no remedy; despatch him quickly."  Command was now given that the fire should be kindled. But because there were not more green fagots than two horses could carry, it kindled not speedily, and was a pretty while also before it took the reeds upon the fagots. At length it burned about him, but the wind having full strength at that place, and being a lowering cold morning, it blew the flame from him, so that he was in a manner little more than touched by the fire. Within a space after, a few dry fagots were brought, and a new fire kindled with fagots, (for there were no more reeds) and those burned at the nether parts, but had small power above, because of the wind, saving that it burnt his hair and scorched his skin a little. In the time of which fire, even as at the first flame, he prayed, saying mildly, and not very loud, but as one without pain, "O Jesus, Son of David, have mercy upon me, and receive my soul!" After the second fire was spent, he wiped both his eyes with his hands, and beholding the people, he said with an indifferent, loud voice, "For God's love, good people, let me have more fire!" and all this while his nether parts did burn; but the fagots were so few that the flame only singed his upper parts.  The third fire was kindled within a while after, which was more extreme than the other two. In this fire he prayed with a loud voice, "Lord Jesus, have mercy upon me! Lord Jesus receive my spirit!" And these were the last words he was heard to utter. But when he was black in the mouth, and his tongue so swollen that he could not speak, yet his lips went until they were shrunk to the gums: and he knocked his breast with his hands until one of his arms fell off, and then knocked still with the other, while the fat, water, and blood dropped out at his fingers' ends, until by renewing the fire, his strength was gone, and his hand clave fast in knocking to the iron upon his breast. Then immediately bowing forwards, he yielded up his spirit.  Thus was he three quarters of an hour or more in the fire.  Even as a lamb, patiently he abode the extremity thereof, neither moving forwards, backwards, nor to any side; but he died as quietly as a child in his bed. And he now reigneth, I doubt not, as a blessed martyr in the joys of heaven, prepared for the faithful in Christ before the foundations of the world; for whose constancy all Christians are bound to praise God.The Life and Conduct of Dr. Rowland Taylor of HadleyDr. Rowland Taylor, vicar of Hadley, in Suffolk, was a man of eminent learning, and had been admitted to the degree of doctor of the civil and canon law.  His attachment to the pure and uncorrupted principles of Christianity recommended him to the favor and friendship of Dr. Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he lived a considerable time, until through his interest he obtained the living at Hadley.  Not only was his word a preaching unto them, but all his life and conversation was an example of unfeigned Christian life and true holiness. He was void of all pride, humble and meek as any child; so that none were so poor but they might boldly, as unto their father, resort unto him; neither was his lowliness childish or fearful, but, as occasion, time, and place required, he would be stout in rebuking the sinful and evildoers; so that none was so rich but he would tell them plainly his fault, with such earnest and grave rebukes as became a good curate and pastor. He was a man very mild, void of all rancor, grudge or evil will; ready to do good to all men; readily forgiving his enemies; and never sought to do evil to any.  To the poor that were blind, lame, sick, bedrid, or that had many children, he was a very father, a careful patron, and diligent provider, insomuch that he caused the parishioners to make a general provision for them; and he himself (beside the continual relief that they always found at his house) gave an honest portion yearly to the common almsbox. His wife also was an honest, discreet, and sober matron, and his children well nurtured, brought up in the fear of God and good learning.  He was a good salt of the earth, savorly biting the corrupt manners of evil men; a light in God's house, set upon a candlestick for all good men to imitate and follow.  Thus continued this good shepherd among his flock, governing and leadning them through the wilderness of this wicked world, all the days of the most innocent and holy king of blessed memory, Edward VI. But on his demise, and the succession of Queen Mary to the throne, he escaped not the cloud that burst on so many besdie; for two of his parishioners, Foster, an attorney, and Clark, a tradesman, out of blind zeal, resolved that Mass should be celebrated, in all its superstitious forms, in the parish church of Hadley, on Monday before Easter. This Dr. Taylor, entering the church, strictly forbade; but Clark forced the Doctor out of the church, celebrated Mass, and immediately informed the lord-chancellor, bishop of Winchester of his behavior, who summoned him to appear, and answer the complaints that were alleged against him.  The doctor upon the receipt of the summons, cheerfully prepared to obey the same; and rejected the advice of his friends to fly beyond sea. When Gardiner saw Dr. Taylor, he, according to his common custom, reviled him. Dr. Taylor heard his abuse patiently, and when the bishop said, "How darest thou look me in the face! knowest thou not who I am?" Dr. Taylor replied, "You are Dr. Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, and lord-chancellor, and yet but a mortal man. But if I should be afraid of your lordly looks, why fear ye not God, the Lord of us all? With what countenance will you appear before the judgment seat of Christ, and answer to your oath made first unto King Henry VIII, and afterward unto King Edward VI, his son?"  A long conversation ensued, in which Dr. Taylor was so piously collected and severe upon his antagonist, that he exclaimed:  "Thou art a blasphemous heretic! Thou indeed blasphemist the blessed Sacrament, (here he put off his cap) and speakest against the holy Mass, which is made a sacrifice for the quick and the dead." The bishop afterward committed him into the king's bench.  When Dr. Taylor came there, he found the virtuous and vigilant preacher of God's Word, Mr. Bradford; who equally thanked God that He had provided him with such a comfortable fellow-prisoner; and they both together praised God, and continued in prayer, reading and exhorting one another.  After Dr. Taylor had lain some time in prison, he was cited to appear in the arches of Bow-church.  Dr. Taylor being condemned, was committed to the Clink, and the keepers were charged to treat him roughly; at night he was removed to the Poultry Compter.  When Dr. Taylor had lain in the Compter about a week on the fourth of February, Bonner came to degrade him, bringing with him such ornaments as appertained to the massing mummery; but the Doctor refused these trappings until they were forced upon him.  The night after he was degraded his wife came with John Hull, his servant, and his son Thomas, and were by the gentleness of the keepers permitted to sup with him.  After supper, walking up and down, he gave God thanks for His grace, that had given him strength to abide by His holy Word. With tears they prayed together, and kissed one another. Unto his son Thomas he gave a Latin book, containing the notable sayings of the old martyrs, and in the end of that he wrote his testament:  "I say to my wife, and to my children, The Lord gave you unto me, and the Lord hath taken me from you, and you from me: blessed be the name of the Lord! I believe that they are blessed which die in the Lord. God careth for sparrows, and for the hairs of our heads. I have ever found Him more faithful and favorable, than is any father or husband. Trust ye therefore in Him by the means of our dear Savior Christ's merits: believe, love, fear, and obey Him: pray to Him, for He hath promised to help. Count me not dead, for I shall certainly live, and never die. I go before, and you shall follow after, to our long home."  On the morrow the sheriff of London with his officers came to the Compter by two o'clock in the morning, and brought forth Dr. Taylor; and without any light led him to the Woolsack, an inn without Aldgate. Dr. Taylor's wife, suspecting that her husband should that night be carried away, watched all night in St. Botolph's church-porch beside Aldgate, having her two children, the one named Elizabeth, of thirteen years of age (whom, being left without father or mother, Dr. Taylor had brought up of alms from three years old), the other named Mary, Dr. Taylor's own daughter.  Now, when the sheriff and his company came against St.  Botolph's church, Elizabeth cried, saying, "O my dear father! mother, mother, here is my father led away." Then his wife cried, "Rowland, Rowland, where art thou?"-for it was a very dark morning, that the one could not well see the other. Dr. Taylor answered, "Dear wife, I am here"; and stayed. The sheriff's men would have led him forth, but the sheriff said, "Stay a little, masters, I pray you; and let him speak to his wife"; and so they stayed.  Then came she to him, and he took his daughter Mary in his arms; and he, his wife, and Elizabeth kneeled down and said the Lord's Prayer, at which sight the sheriff wept apace, and so did divers others of the company. After they had prayed, he rose up and kissed his wife, and shook her by the hand, and said, "Farewell, my dear wife; be of good comfort, for I am quiet in my conscience. God shall stir up a father for my children."  All the way Dr. Taylor was joyful and merry, as one that ccounted himself going to a most pleasant banquet or bridal. He spake many notable things to the sheriff and yeomen of the guard that conducted him, and often moved them to weep, through his much earnest calling upon them to repent, and to amend their evil and wicked living. Oftentimes also he caused them to wonder and rejoice, to see him so constant and steadfast, void of all fear, joyful in heart, and glad to die.  When Dr. Taylor had arrived at Aldham Common, the place where he should suffer, seeing a great multitude of people, he asked, "What place is this, and what meaneth it that so much people are gathered hither?" It was answered, "It is Aldham Common, the place where you must suffer; and the people have come to look upon you." Then he said, "Thanked be God, I am even at home"; and he alighted from his horse and with both hands rent the hood from his head.  His head had been notched and clipped like as a man would clip a fool's; which cost the good bishop Bonner had bestowed upon him. But when the people saw his reverend and ancient face, with a long white beard, they burst out with weeping tears, and cried, saying: "God save thee, good Dr. Taylor! Jesus Christ strengthen thee, and help thee! the Holy Ghost comfort thee!" with such other like good wishes.  When he had prayed, he went to the stake and kissed it, and set himself into a pitch barrel, which they had put for him to stand in, and stood with his back upright against the stake, with his hands folded together, and his eyes towards heaven, and continually prayed.  They then bound him with the chains, and having set up the fagots, one Warwick cruelly cast a fagot at him, which struck him on his head, and cut his face, sot hat the blood ran down. Then said Dr. Taylor, "O friend, I have harm enough; what needed that?"  Sir John Shelton standing by, as Dr. Taylor was speaking, and saying the Psalm Miserere in English, struck him on the lips:  "You knave," he said, "speak Latin: I will make thee." At last they kindled the fire; and Dr. Taylor holding up both his hands, calling upon God, and said, "Merciful Father of heaven! for Jesus Christ, my Savior's sake, receive my soul into Thy hands!" So he stood still without either crying or moving, with his hands folded together, until Soyce, with a halberd struck him on the head until his brains fell out, and the corpse fell down into the fire.  Thus rendered up this man of God his blessed soul into the hands of his merciful Father, and to his most dear Savior Jesus Christ, whom he most entirely loved, faithfully and earnestly preached, obediently followed in living, and constantly glorified in death.Martyrdom of William HunterWilliam Hunter had been trained to the doctrines of the Reformation from his earliest youth, being descended from religious parents, who carefully instructed him in the principles of true religion.  Hunter, then nineteen years of age, refusing to receive the communion at Mass, was threatened to be brought before the bishop; to whom this valiant young martyr was conducted by a constable.  Bonner caused William to be brought into a chamber, where he began to reason with him, proimising him security and pardon if he would recant. Nay, he would have been content if he would have gone only to receive and to confession, but William would not do so for all the world.  Upon this the bishop commanded his men to put William in the stocks in his gate house, where he sat two days and nights, with a crust of brown bread and a cup of water only, which he did not touch.  At the two days' end, the bishop came to him, and finding him steadfast in the faith, sent him to the convict prison, and commanded the keeper to lay irons upon him as many as he could bear. He continued in prison three quarters of a year, during which time he had been before the bishop five times, besides the time when he was condemned in the consistory in St. Paul's, February 9, at which time his brother, Robert Hunter, was present.  Then the bishop, calling William, asked him if he would recant, and finding he was unchangeable, pronounced sentence upon him, that he should go from that place to Newgate for a time, and thence to Brentwood, there to be burned.  About a month afterward, William was sent down to Brentwood, where he was to be executed. On coming to the stake, he knelt down and read the Fifty-first Psalm, until he came to these words, "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise." Steadfast in refusing the queen's pardon, if he would become an apostate, at length one Richard Ponde, a bailiff, came, and made the chain fast about him.  William now cast his psalter into his brother's hand, who said, "William, think on the holy passion of Christ, and be not afraid of death." "Behold," answered William, "I am not afraid." Then he lifted up his hands to heaven, and said, "Lord, Lord, Lord, receive my spirit;" and casting down he head again into the smothering smoke, he yielded up his life for the truth, sealing it with his blood to the praise of God.Dr. Robert FarrarThis worthy and learned prelate, the bishop of St. David's in Wales, having in the former reign, as well as since the accession of Mary, been remarkably zealous in promoting the reformed doctrines, and exploding the rrors of popish idolatry, was summoned, among others, before the persecuting bishop of Winchester, and other commissioners set apart for the abominable work of devastation and massacre.  His principal accusers and persecutors, on a charge of praemunire in the reign of Edward VI were George Constantine Walter, his servant; Thomas Young, chanter of the cathedral, afterward bishop of Bangor, etc. Dr. Farrar ably replied to the copies of information laid against him, consisting of fifty-six articles. The whole process of this trial was long and tedious. Delay succeeded delay, and after that Dr. Farrar had been long unjustly detained in custody under sureties, in the reign of King Edward, because he had been promoted by the duke of Somerset, whence after his fall he found fewer friends to support him against such as wanted his bishopric by the coming in of Queen Mary, he was accused and examined not for any matter of praemunire, but for his faith and doctrine; for which he was called before the bishop of Winchester with Bishop Hooper, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Bradford, Mr. Saunders, and others, February 4, 1555; on which day he would also with them have been condemned, but his condemnation was deferred, and he sent to prison again, where he continued until February 14, and then was sent into Wales to receive sentence. He was six times brought up before Henry Morgan, bishop of St. David's, who demanded if he would abjure; from which he zealously dissented, and appealed to Cardinal Pole; notwithstanding which, the bishop, proceeding in his rage, pronounced him a heretic excommunicate, and surrendered him to the secular power.  Dr. Farrar, being condemned and degraded, was not long after brought to the place of execution in the town of Carmathen, in the market-place of which, on the south side of the market-cross, March 30, 1555, being Saturday next before Passion Sunday, he most constantly sustained the torments of the fire.  Concerning his constancy, it is said that one Richard Jones, a knight's son, coming to Dr. Farrar a little before his death, seemed to lament the painfulness of the death he had to suffer; to whom the bishop answered that if he saw him once stir in the pains of his burning, he might then give no credit to his doctrine; and as he said, so did he maintain his promise, patiently standing without emotion, until one Richard Gravell with a staff struck him down.Martyrdom of Rawlins WhiteRawlins White was by his calling and occupation a fisherman, living and continuing in the said trade for the space of twenty years at least, in the town of Cardiff, where he bore a very good name amongst his neighbors.  Though the good man was altogether unlearned, and withal very simple, yet it pleased God to remove him from error and idolatry to a knowledge of the truth, through the blessed Reformation in Edward's reign. He had his son taught to read English, and after the little boy could read pretty well, his father every night after supper, summer and winter, made the boy read a portion of the Holy Scriptures, and now and then a part of some other good book.  When he had continued in his profession the space of five years, King Edward died, upon whose decease Queen Mary succeeded and with her all kinds of superstition crept in. White was taken by the officers of the town, as a man suspected of heresy, brought before the Bishop Llandaff, and committed to prison in Chepstow, and at last removed to the castle of Cardiff, where he continued for the space of one whole year. Being brought before the bishop in his chapel, he counselled him by threats and promises. But as Rawlins would in no wise recant his opinions, the bishop told him plainly that he must proceed against him by law, and condemn him as a heretic.  Before they proceeded to this extremity, the bishop proposed that prayer should be said for his conversion. "This," said White, "is like a godly bishop, and if your request be godly and right, and you pray as you ought, no doubt God will hear you; pray you, therefore, to your God, and I will pray to my God." After the bishop and his party had done praying, he asked Rawlins if he would now revoke. "You find," said the latter, "your prayer is not granted, for I remain the same; and God will strengthen me in support of this truth." After this, the bishop tried what saying Mass would do; but Rawlins called all the people to witness that he did not bow down to the host. Mass being ended, Rawlins was called for again; to whom the bishop used many persuasions; but the blessed man continued so steadfast in his former profession that the bishop's discourse was to no purpose. The bishop now caused the definitive sentence to be read, which being ended, Rawlins was carried again to Cardiff, to a loathsome prison in the town, called Cockmarel, where he passed his time in prayer, and in the singing of Psalms. In about three weeks the order came from town for his execution.  When he came to the place, where his poor wife and children stood weeping, the sudden sight of them so pierced his heart, that the tears trickled down his face. Being come to the altar of his sacrifice, in going toward the stake, he fell down upon his knees, and kissed the ground; and in rising again, a little earth sticking on his face, he said these words. "Earth unto earth, and dust unto dust; thou art my mother, and unto thee I shall return."  When all things were ready, directly over against the stake, in the face of Rawlins White, there was a stand erected, whereon stepped up a priest, addressing himself to the people, but, as he spoke of the Romish doctrines of the Sacraments, Rawlins cried out, "Ah! thou wicked hypocrite, dost thou presume to prove thy false doctrine by Scripture? Look in the text that followeth; did not Christ say, 'Do this in remembrance of me?'"  Then some that stood by cried out, "Put fire! set on fire!" which being done, the straw and reeds cast up a great and sudden flame. In which flame this good man bathed his hands so long, until such time as the sinews shrank, and the fat dropped away, saving that once he did, as it were, wipe his face with one of them. All this while, which was somewhat long, he cried with a loud voice, "O Lord, receive my spirit!" until he could not open his mouth. At last the extremity of the fire was so vehement against his legs that they were consumed almost before the rest of his body was hurt, which made the whole body fall over the chains into the fire sooner than it would have done. Thus died this good old man for his testimony of God's truth, and is now rewarded, no doubt, with the crown of eternal life.The Rev. George MarshGeorge Marsh, born in the parish of Deane, in the county of Lancaster, received a good education and trade from his parents; about his twenty-fifth year he married, and lived, blessed with several children, on his farm until his wife died. He then went to study at Cambridge, and became the curate of Rev. Lawrence Saunders, in which duty he constantly and zealously set forth the truth of God's Word, and the false doctrines of the modern Antichrist.  Being confined by Dr. Coles, the bishop of Chester, within the precincts of his own house, he was dept from any intercourse with his friends during four months; his friends and mother, earnestly wished him to have flown from "the wrath to come;" but Mr. Marsh thought that such a step would ill agree with that profession he had during nine years openly made. He, however, secreted himself, but he had much struggling, and in secret prayer begged that God would direct him, through the advice of his best friends, for his own glory and to what was best. At length, determined by a letter he received, boldly to confess the faith of Christ, he took leave of his mother-in-law and other friends, recommending his children to their care and departed for Smethehills, whence he was, with others, conducted to Lathum, to undergo examination before the earl of Derby, Sir William Nores, Mr. Sherburn, the parson of Garpnal, and others. The various questions put to him he answered with a good conscience, but when Mr. Sherburn interrogated him upon his belief of the Sacrament of the altar, Mr. Marsh answered like a true Protestant that the essence of the bread and wine was not at all changed, hence, after receiving dreadful threats from some, and fair words from others, for his opinions, he was remanded to ward, where he lay two nights without any bed.  On Palm Sunday he underwent a second examination, and Mr.  Marsh much lamented that his fear should at all have induced him to prevaricate, and to seek his safety, as long as he did not openly deny Christ; and he again cried more earnestly to God for strength that he might not be overcome by the subtleties of those who strove to overrule the purity of his faith. He underwent three examinations before Dr. Coles, who, finding him steadfast in the Protestant faith, began to read his sentence; but he was interrupted by the chancellor, who prayed the bishop to stay before it was too late. The priest then prayed for Mr. Marsh, but the latter, upon being again solicited to recant, said he durst not deny his Savior Christ, lest he lose His everlasting mercy, and so obtain eternal death. The bishop then proceeded in the sentence. He was committed to a dark dungeon, and lay deprived of the consolation of any one (for all were afraid to relieve or communicate with him) until the day appointed came that he should suffer. The sheriffs of the city, Amry and Couper, with their officers, went to the north gate, and took out Mr. George Marsh, who walked all the way with the Book in his hand, looking upon the same, whence the people said, "This man does not go to his death as a thief, nor as one that deserveth to die."  When he came to the place of execution without the city, near Spittal=Boughton, Mr. Cawdry, deputy chamberlain of Chester, showed Mr. Marsh a writing under a great seal, saying that it was a pardon for him if he would recant. He answered that he would gladly accept the same did it not tend to pluck him from God.  After that, he began to speak to the people showing the cause of his death, and would have exhorted them to stick unto Christ, but one of the sheriffs prevented him. Kneeling down, he then said his prayers, put off his clothes unto his shirt, and was chained to the post, having a number of fagots under him, and a thing made like a firkin, with pitch and tar in it, over his head. The fire being unskilfully made, and the wind driving it in eddies, he suffered great extremity, which notwithstanding he bore with Christian fortitude.  When he had been a long time tormented in the fire without moving, having his flesh so broiled and puffed up that they who stood before him could not see the chain wherewith he was fastened, and therefore supposed that he had been dead, suddenly he spread abroad his arms, saying, "Father of heaven have mercy upon me!" and so yielded his spirit into the hands of the Lord. Upon this, many of the people said he was a martyr, and died gloriously patient. This caused the bishop shortly after to make a sermon in the cathedral church, and therein he affirmed, that the said 'Marsh was a heretic, burnt as such, and is a firebrand in hell.' Mr. Marsh suffered April 24, 1555.William FlowerWilliam Flower, otherwise Branch, was born at Snow-hill, in the county of Cambridge, where he went to school some years, and then came to the abby of Ely. After he had remained a while he became a professed monk, was made a priest in the same house, and there celebrated and sang Mass. After that, by reason of a visitation, and certain injunctions by the authority of Henry VIII he took upon him the habit of a secular priest, and returned to Snow-hill, where he was born, and taught children about half a year.  He then went to Ludgate, in Suffolk, and served as a secular priest about a quarter of a year; from thence to Stoniland; at length to Tewksbury, where he married a wife, with whom he ever after faithfully and honestly continued. After marriage he resided at Tewksbury about two years, and thence went to Brosley, where he practiced physic and surgery; but departing from those parts he came to London, and finally settled at Lambeth, where he and his wife dwelt together. However, he was generally abroad, excepting once or twice in a month, to visit and see his wife. Being at home upon Easter Sunday morning, he came over the water from lambeth into St. Margaret's Church at Westminster; when seeing a priest, named John Celtham, administering and giving the Sacrament of the alter to the people, and being greatly offended in his conscience with the priest for the same, he struck and wounded him upon the head, and also upon the arm and hand, with his wood knife, the priest having at the same time in his hand a chalice with the consecrated host therein, which became sprinkled with blood.  Mr. Flower, for this injudicious zeal, was heavily ironed, and put into the gatehouse at Westminster; and afterward summoned before bishop Bonner and his ordinary, where the bishop, after he had sworn him upon a Book, ministered articles and interrogatories to him.  After examination, the bishop began to exhort him again to return to the unity of his mother the Catholic Church, with many fair promises. These Mr. Flower steadfastly rejecting, the bishop ordered him to appear in the same place in the afternoon, and in the meantime to consider well his former answer; but he, neither apologizing for having struck the priest, nor swerving from his faith, the bishop assigned him the next day, April 20, to receive sentence if he would not recant. The next morning, the bishop accordingly proceeded to the sentence, condemning and excommunicating him for a heretic, and after pronouncing him to be degraded, committed him to the secular power.  On April 24, St. Mark's eve, he was brought to the place of martyrdom, in St. Margaret's churchyard, Westminster, where the fact was committed: and there coming to the stake, he prayed to Almighty God, made a confession of his faith, and forgave all the world.  This done, his hand was held up against the stake, and struck off, his left hand being fastened behind him. Fire was then set to him, and he burning therein, cried with a loud voice, "O Thou Son of God receive my soul!" three times. His speech being now taken from him, he spoke no more, but notwithstanding he lifted up the stump with his other arm as long as he could.  Thus he endured the extremity of the fire, and was cruelly tortured, for the few fagots that were brought being insufficient to burn him they were compelled to strike him down into the fire, where lying along upon the ground, his lower part was consumed in the fire, whilst his upper part was little injured, his tongue moving in his mouth for a considerable time.The Rev. John Cardmaker and John WarneMay 30, 1555, the Rev. John Cardmaker, otherwise called Taylor, prebendary of the Church of Wells, and John Warne, upholsterer, of St. John's, Walbrook, suffered together in Smithfield. Mr. Cardmaker, who first was an observant friar before the dissolution of the abbeys, afterward was a married minister, and in King Edward's time appointed to be a reader in St. Paul's; being apprehended in the beginning of Queen Mary's reign, with Dr. Barlow, bishop of Bath, he was brought to London, and put in the Fleet prison, King Edward's laws being yet in force. In Mary's reign, when brought before the bishop of Winchester, the latter offered them the queen's mercy, if they would recant.  Articles having been preferred against Mr. John Warne, he was examined upon them by Bonner, who earnestly exhorted him to recant his opinions, to whom he answered, "I am persuaded that I am in the right opinion, and I see no cause to recant; for all the filthiness and idolatry lies in the Church of Rome."  The bishop then, seeing that all his fair promises and terrible threatenings could not prevail, pronounced the definitive sentence of condemnation, and ordered May 30, 1555, for the execution of John Cardmaker and John Warne, who were brought by the sheriffs to Smithfield. Being come to the stake, the sheriffs called Mr. Cardmaker aside, and talked with him secretly, during which Mr. Warne prayed, was chained to the stake, and had wood and reeds set about him.  The people were greatly afflicted, thinking that Mr. Cardmaker would recant at the burning of Mr. Warne. At length Mr. Cardmaker departed from the sheriffs, and came towards the stake, knelt down, and made a long prayer in silence to himself. He then rose up, put off his clothes to his shirt, and went with a bold courage unto the stake and kissed it; and taking Mr. Warne by the hand, he heartily comforted him, and was bound to the stake, rejoicing. The people seeing this so suddenly done, contrary to their previous expectation, cried out, "God be praised! the Lord strengthen thee, Cardmaker! the Lord Jesus receive thy spirit!" And this continued while the executioner put fire to them, and both had passed through the fire to the blessed rest and peace among God's holy saints and martyrs, to enjoy the crown of triumph and victory prepared for the elect soldiers and warriors of Christ Jesus in His blessed Kingdom, to whom be glory and majesty forever. Amen.John Simpson and John ArdeleyJohn Simpson and John Ardeley were condemned on the same day with Mr. Carmaker and John Warne, which was the twenty-fifth of May. They were shortly after sent down from London to Essex, where they were burnt in one day, John Simpson at Rochford, and John Ardeley at Railey, glorifying God in His beloved Son, and rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer.Thomas Haukes, Thomas Watts, and Anne AskewThomas Haukes, with six others, was condemned on the ninth of February, 1555. In education he was erudite; in person, comely, and of good stature; in manners, a gentleman, and a sincere Christian. A little before death, several of Mr. Hauke's friends, terrified by the sharpness of the punishment he was going to suffer, privately desired that in the midst of the flames he should show them some token, whether the pains of burning were so great that a man might not collectedly endure it. This he promised to do; and it was agreed that if the rage of the pain might be suffered, then he should lift up his hands above his head towards heaven, before he gave up the ghost.  Not long after, Mr. Haukes was led away to the place appointed for slaughter by Lord Rich, and being come to the stake, mildly and patiently prepared himself for the fire, having a strong chain cast about his middle, with a multitude of people on every side compassing him about, unto whom after he had spoken many things, and poured out his soul unto God, the fire was kindled.  When he had continued long in it, and his speech was taken away by violence of the flame, his skin drawn together, and his fingers consumed with the fire, so that it was thought that he was gone, suddenly and contrary to all expectation, this good man being mindful of his promise, reached up his hands burning in flames over his head to the living God, and with great rejoicings as it seemed, struck or clapped them three times together. A great shout followed this wonderful circumstance, and then this blessed martyr of Christ, sinking down in the fire, gave up his spirit, June 10, 1555.  Thomas Watts, of Billerica, in Essex, of the diocese of London, was a linen draper. He had daily expected to be taken by God's adversaries, and this came to pass on the fifth of April, 1555, when he was brought before Lord Rich, and other commissioners at Chelmsford, and accused for not coming to the church.  Being consigned over to the bloody bishop, who gave him several hearings, and, as usual, many arguments, with much entreaty, that he would be a disciple of Antichrist, but his preaching availed not, and he resorted to his last revenge-that of condemnation.  At the stake, after he had kissed it, he spake to Lord Rich, charging him to repent, for the Lord would revenge his death. Thus did this good martyr offer his body to the fire, in defence of the true Gospel of the Savior.  Thomas Osmond, William Bamford, and Nicholas Chamberlain, all of the town of Coxhall, being sent up to be examined, Bonner, after several hearings, pronounced them obstinate heretics, and delivered them to the sheriffs, in whose custody they remained until they were delivered to the sheriff of Essex county, and by him were executed, Chamberlain at Colchester, the fourteenth of June; Thomas Osmond at Maningtree, and William Bamford, alias Butler, at Harwich, the fifteenth of June, 1555; all dying full of the glorious hope of immortality.  Then Wriotheseley, lord chancellor, offered Anne Askew the king's pardon if she would recant; who made this answer, that she came not thither to deny her Lord and Master. And thus the good Anne Askew, being compassed in with flames of fire, as a blessed sacrifice unto God, slept in the Lord, A.D. 1546, leaving behind her a singular example of Christian constancy for all men to follow.Rev. John Bradford, and John Leaf, an ApprenticeRev. John Bradford was born at Manchester, in Lancashire; he was a good Latin scholar, and afterward became a servant of Sir John Harrington, knight.  He continued several years in an honest and thriving way; but the Lord had elected him to a better function. Hence he departed from his master, quitting the Temple, at London, for the University of Cambridge, to learn, by God's law, how to further the building of the Lord's temple. In a few years after, the university gave him the degree of master of arts, and he became a fellow of Pembroke Hall.  Martin Bucer first urged him to preach, and when he modestly doubted his ability, Bucer was wont to reply, "If thou hast not fine wheat bread, yet give the poor people barley bread, or whatsoever else the Lord hath committed unto thee." Dr. Ridley, that worthy bishop of London, and glorious martyr of Christ, first called him to take the degree of a deacon and gave him a prebend in his cathedral Church of St. Paul.  In this preaching office Mr. Bradford diligently labored for the space of three years. Sharply he reproved sin, sweetly he preached Christ crucified, ably he disproved heresies and errors, earnestly he persuaded to godly life. After the death of blessed King Edward VI Mr. Bradford still continued diligent in preaching, until he was suppressed by Queen Mary.  An act now followed of the blackest ingratitude, and at which a pagan would blush. It has been recited, that a tumult was occasioned by Mr. Bourne's (then bishop of Bath) preaching at St. Paul's Cross; the indignation of the people placed his life in imminent danger; indeed a dagger was thrown at him. In this situation he entreated Mr. Bradford, who stood behind him. to speak in his place, and assuage the tumult. The people welcomed Mr. Bradford, and the latter afterward kept close to him, that his presence might prevent the populace from renewing their assaults.  The same Sunday in the afternoon, Mr. Bradford preached at Bow Church in Cheapside, and reproved the people sharply for their seditious misdemeanor. Notwithstanding this conduct, within three days after, he was sent for to the Tower of London, where the queen then was, to appear before the Council. There he was charged with this act of saving Mr. Bourne, which was called seditious, and they also objected against him for preaching. Thus he was committed, first to the Tower, then to other prisons, and, after his condemnation, to the Poultry Compter, where he preached twice a day continually, unless sickness hindered him. Such as his credit with the keeper of the king's Bench, that he permitted him in an evening to visit a poor, sick person near the steel-yard, upon his promise to return in time, and in this he never failed.  The night before he was sent to Newgate, he was troubled in his sleep by foreboding dreams, that on Monday after he should be burned in Smithfield. In the afternoon the keeper's wife came up and announced this dreadful news to him, but in him it excited only thankfulness to God. At night half a dozen friends came, with whom he spent all the evening in prayer and godly exercises.  When he was removed to Newgate, a weeping crowd accompanied him, and a rumor having been spread that he was to suffer at four the next morning, an immense multitude attended. At nine o'clock Mr. Bradford was brought into Smithfield. The cruelty of the sheriff deserves notice; for his brother-in-law, Roger Beswick, having taken him by the hand as he passed, Mr. Woodroffe, with his staff, cut his head open.  Mr. Bradford, being come to the place, fell flat on the ground, and putting off his clothes unto the shirt, he went to the stake, and there suffered with a young man of twenty years of age, whose name was John Leaf, an apprentice to Mr. Humphrey Gaudy, tallow-chandler, of Christ-church, London. Upon Friday before Palm Sunday, he was committed to the Compter in Bread-street, and afterward examined and condemned by the bloody bishop.  It is reported of him, that, when the bill of his confession was read unto him, instead of pen, he took a pin, and pricking his hand, sprinkled the blood upon the said bill, desiring the reader thereof to show the bishop that he had sealed the same bill with his blood already.  They both ended this mortal life, July 12, 1555, like two lambs, without any alteration of their countenances, hoping to obtain that prize they had long run for; to which may Almighty God conduct us all, through the merits of Christ our Savior!  We shall conclude this article with mentioning that Mr.  Sheriff Woodroffe, it is said, within half a year after, was struck on the right side with a palsy, and for the space of eight years after, (until his dying day,) he was unable to turn himself in his bed; thus he became at last a fearful object to behold.  The day after Mr. Bradford and John Leaf suffered in Smithfield William Minge, priest, died in prison at Maidstone. With as great constancy and boldness he yielded up his life in prison, as if it had pleased God to have called him to suffer by fire, as other godly men had done before at the stake, and as he himself was ready to do, had it pleased God to have called him to this trial.Rev. John Bland, Rev. John Frankesh, Nicholas Shetterden, and Humphrey MiddletonThese Christian persons were all burnt at Canterbury for the same cause. Frankesh and Bland were ministers and preachers of the Word of God, the one being parson of Adesham, and the other vicar of Rolvenden. Mr. Bland was cited to answer for his opposition to antichristianism, and underwent several examinations before Dr. Harpsfield, archdeacon of Canterbury, and finally on the twenty-fifth of June, 1555, again withstanding the power of the pope, he was condemned, and delivered to the secular arm. On the same day were condemned John Frankesh, Nicholas Shetterden, Humphrey Middleton, Thacker, and Crocker, of whom Thacker only recanted.  Being delivered to the secular power, Mr. Bland, with the three former, were all burnt together at Canterbury, July 12, 1555, at two several stakes, but in one fire, when they, in the sight of God and His angels, and before men, like true soldiers of Jesus Christ, gave a constant testimony to the truth of His holy Gospel.Dirick Carver and John LaunderThe twenty-second of July, 1555, Dirick Carver, brewer, of Brighthelmstone, aged forty, was burnt at Lewes. And the day following John Launder, husbandman, aged twenty-five, of Godstone, Surrey, was burnt at Stening.  Dirick Carver was a man whom the Lord had blessed as well with temporal riches as with his spiritual treasures. At his coming into the town of Lewes to be burnt, the people called to him, beseeching God to strengthen him in the faith of Jesus Christ; and, as he came to the stake, he knelt down, and prayed earnestly. Then his Book was thrown into the barrel, and when he had stripped himself, he too, went into a barrel. As soon as he was in, he took the Book, and threw it among the people, upon which the sheriff commanded, in the name of the king and queen, on pain of death , to throw in the Book again. And immediately the holy martyr began to address the people. After he had prayed a while, he said, "O Lord my God, Thou hast written, he that will not forsake wife, children, house, and every thing that he hath, and take up Thy cross and follow Thee, is not worthy of Thee! but Thou, Lord, knowest that I have forsaken all to come unto Thee. Lord, have mercy upon me, for unto Thee I commend my spirit! and my soul doth rejoice in Thee!" These were the last words of this faithful servant of Christ before enduring the fire. And when the fire came to him, he cried, "O Lord, have mercy upon me!" and sprang up in the fire, calling upon the name of Jesus, until he gave up the ghost.  James Abbes. This young man wandered about to escape apprehension, but was at last informed against, and brought before the bishop of Norwich, who influenced him to recant; to secure him further in apostasy, the bishop afterward gave him a piece of money; but the interference of Providence is here remarkable. This bribe lay so heavily upon his conscience, that he returned, threw back the money, and repented of his conduct. Like Peter, he was contrite, steadfast in the faith, and sealed it with his blood at Bury, August 2, 1555, praising and glorifying God.John Denley, John Newman, and Patrick PackinghamMr. Denley and Newman were returning one day to Maidstone, the place of their abode, when they were met by E. Tyrrel, Esq., a bigoted justice of the peace in Essex, and a cruel persecutor of the Protestants. He apprehended them merely on suspicion. On the fifth of July, 1555, they were condemned, and consigned to the sheriffs, who sent Mr. Denley to Uxbridge, where he perished, August eighth, 1555. While suffering in agony, and singing a Psalm, Dr. Story inhumanly ordered one of the tormentors to throw a fagot at him, which cut his face severely, caused him to cease singing, and to raise his hands to his face. Just as Dr. Story was remarking in jest that he had spoiled a good song, the pious martyr again changed, spread his hands abroad in the flames, and through Christ Jesus resigned his soul into the hands of his Maker.  Mr. Packingham suffered at the same town on the twenty-eigth of the same month.  Mr. Newman, pewterer, was burnt at Saffron Waldon, in Essex, August 31, for the same cause, and Richard Hook about the same time perished at Chichester.W. Coker, W. Hooper, H. Laurence, R. Colliar, R. Wright and W. StereThese persons all of Kent, were examined at the same time with Mr. Bland and Shetterden, by Thornton, bishop of Dover, Dr. Harpsfield, and others. These six martyrs and witnesses of the truth were consigned to the flames in Canterbury, at the end of August, 1555.  Elizabeth Warne, widow of John Warne, upholsterer, martyr, was burnt at Stratford-le-bow, near London, at the end of August, 1555.  George Tankerfield, of London, cook, born at York, aged twenty-seven, in the reign of Edward VI had been a papist; but the cruelty of bloody Mary made him suspect the truth of those doctrines which were enforced by fire and torture. Tankerfield was imprisoned in Newgate about the end of February, 1555, and on August 26, at St. Alban's, he braved the excruciating fire, and joyfully died for the glory of his Redeemer.  Rev. Robert Smith was first in the service of Sir T. Smith, provost of Eton; and was afterward removed to Windsor, where he had a clerkship of ten pounds a year.  He was condemned, July 12, 1555, and suffered August 8, at Uxbridge. He doubted not but that God would give the spectators some token in support of his own cause; this actually happened; for, when he was nearly half burnt, and supposed to be dead, he suddenly rose up, moved the remaining parts of his arms and praised God, then, hanging over the fire, he sweetly slept in the Lord Jesus.  Mr. Stephen Harwood and Mr. Thomas Fust suffered about the same time with Smith and Tankerfield, with whom they were condemned. Mr. William Hale also, of Thorp, in Essex, was sent to Barnet, where about the same time he joined the ever-blessed company of martyrs.  George King, Thomas Leyes, and John Wade, falling sick in Lollard's Tower, were removed to different houses, and died. Their bodies were thrown out in the common fields as unworthy of burial, and lay until the faithful conveyed them away at night.  Mr. William Andrew of Horseley, Essex, was imprisoned in Newgate for heresy; but God chose to call him to himself by the severe treatment he endured in Newgate, and thus to mock the snaguinary expectations of his Catholic persecutors. His body was thrown into the open air, but his soul was received into the everlasting mansions of his heavenly Creator.The Rev. Robert SamuelThis gentleman was minister ofr Bradford, Suffolk, where he industriously taught the flock committed to his charge, while he was openly permitted to discharge his duty. He was first persecuted by Mr. Foster, of Copdock, near Ipswich, a severe and bigoted persecutor of the followers of Christ, according to the truth in the Gospel. Notwithstanding Mr. Samuel was ejected from his living, he continued to exhort and instruct privately; nor would he obey the order for putting away his wife, whom he had married in King Edward's reign; but kept her at Ipswich, where Foster, by warrant, surprised him by night with her. After being imprisoned in Ipswich jail, he was taken before Dr. Hopton, bishop of Norwich, and Dr. Dunnings, his chancellor, two of the most sanguinary among the bigots of those days. To intimidate the worthy pastor, he was in prison chained to a post in such a manner that the weight of his body was supported by the points of his toes: added to this his allowance of provision was reduced to a quantity so insufficient to sustain nature that he was almost ready to devour his own flesh. From this dreadful extremity there was even a degree of mercy in ordering him to the fire. Mr. Samuel suffered August 31, 1555.Bishop Ridley and Bishop LatimerThese reverend prelates suffered October 17, 1555, at Oxford, on the same day Wolsey and Pygot perished at Ely. Pillars of the Church and accomplished ornaments of human nature, they were the admiration of the realm, amiably conspicuous in their lives, and glorious in their deaths.  Dr. Ridley was born in Northumberland, was first tauht grammar at Newcastle, and afterward removed to Cambridge, where his aptitude in education raised him gradually until he came to be the head of Pembroke College, where he received the title of Doctor of Divinity. Having returned from a trip to Paris, he was appointed chaplain by Henry VIII and bishop of Rochester, and was afterwards translated to the see of London in the time of Edward VI.  To his sermons the people resorted, swarming about him like bees, coveting the sweet flowers and wholesome juice of the fruitful doctrine, which he did not only preach, but showed the same by his life, as a glittering lanthorn to the eyes and senses of the blind, in such pure order that his very enemies could not reprove him in any one jot.  His tender treatment of Dr. Heath, who was a prisoner with him during one year, in Edward's reign, evidently proves that he had no Catholic cruelty in his disposition. In person he was erect and well proportioned; in temper forgiving; in self-mortification severe. His first duty in the morning was private prayer: he remained in his study until ten o'clock, and then attended the daily prayer used in his house. Dinner being done, he sat about an hour, conversing pleasantly, or playing at chess. His study next engaged his attention, unless business or visits occurred; about five o'clock prayers followed; and after he would recreate himself at chess for about an hour, then retire to his study until eleven o'clock, and pray on his knees as in the morning. In brief, he was a pattern of godliness and virtue, and such he endeavored to make men wherever he came.  His attentive kindness was displayed particularly to old Mrs. Bonner, mother of Dr. Bonner, the cruel bishop of London. Dr. Ridley, when at his manor at Fulham, always invited her to his house, placed her at the head of his table, and treated her like his own mother; he did the same by Bonner's sister and other relatives; but when Dr. Ridley was under persecution, Bonner pursued a conduct diametrically opposite, and would have sacrificed Dr. Ridley's sister and her husband, Mr. George Shipside, had not Providence delivered him by the means of Dr. Heath, bishop of Worcester.  Dr. Ridley was first in part converted by reading Bertram's book on the Sacrament, and by his conferences with archbishop Cranmer and Peter Martyr.  When Edward VI was removed from the throne, and the bloody Mary succeeded, Bishop Ridley was immediately marked as an object of slaughter. He was first sent to the Tower, and afterward, at Oxford, was consigned to the common prison of Bocardo, with archbishop Cranmer and Mr. Latimer. Being separated from them, he was placed in the house of one Irish, where he remained until the day of his martyrdom, from 1554, until October 16, 1555.  It will easily be supposed that the conversations of these chiefs of the martyrs were elaborate, learned, and instructive. Such indeed they were, and equally beneficial to all their spiritual comforts. Bishop Ridley's letters to various Christian brethren in bonds in all parts, and his disputations with the mitred enemies of Christ, alike proved the clearness of his head and the integrity of his heart. In a letter to Mr. Grindal, (afterward archbishop of Canterbury,) he mentions with affection those who had preceded him in dying for the faith, and those who were expected to suffer; he regrets that popery is re-established in its full abomination, which he attributes to the wrath of God, made manifest in return for the lukewarmness of the clergy and the people in justly appreciating the blessed light of the Reformation.  This old practiced soldier of Christ, Master Hugh Latimer, was the son of one Hugh Latimer, of Thurkesson in the county of Leicester, a husbandman, of a good and wealthy estimation; where also he was born and brought up until he was four years of age, or thereabout: at which time his parents, having him as then left for their only son, with six daughters, seeing his ready, prompt, and sharp wit, purposed to train him up in erudition, and knowledge of good literature; wherein he so profited in his youth at the common schools of his own country, that at the age of fourteen years, he was sent to the University of Cambridge; where he entered into the study of the school divinity of that day, and was from principle a zealous observer of the Romish superstitions of the time. In his oration when he commenced bachelor of divinity, he inveighed against the reformer Melancthon, and openly declaimed against good Mr. Stafford, divinity lecturer in Cambridge.  Mr. Thomas Bilney, moved by a brotherly pity towards Mr. Latimer, begged to wait upon him in his study, and to explain to him the groundwork of his (Mr. Bilney's) faith. This blessed interview effected his conversion: the persecutor of Christ became his zealous advocate, and before Dr. Stafford died he became reconciled to him.  Once converted, he became eager for the conversion of others, and commenced to be public preacher, and private instructor in the university. His sermons were so pointed against the absurdity of praying in the Latin tongue, and withholding the oracles of salvation from the people who were to be saved by belief in them, that he drew upon himself the pulpit animadversions of several of the resident friars and heads of houses, whom he subsequently silenced by his severe criticisms and eloquent arguments. This was at Christmas, 1529. At length Dr. West preached against Mr. Latimer at Barwell Abbey, and prohibited him from preaching again in the churches of the university, notwithstanding which, he continued during three years to advocate openly the cause of Christ, and even his enemies confessed the power of those talents he possessed. Mr. Bilney remained here some time with Mr. Latimer, and thus the place where they frequently walked together obtained the name of Heretics' Hill.  Mr. Latimer at this time traced out the innocence of a poor woman, accused by her husband of the murder of her child. Having preached before King Henry VIII at Windsor, he obtained the unfortunate mother's pardon. This, with many other benevolent acts, served only to excite the spleen of his adversaries. He was summoned before Cardinal Wolsey for heresy, but being a strenuous supporter of the king's supremacy, in opposition to the pope's, by favor of Lord Cromwell and Dr. Buts, (the king's physician,) he obtained the living of West Kingston, in Wiltshire. For his sermons here against purgatory, the immaculacy of the Virgin, and the worship of images, he was cited to appear before Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, and John, bishop of London. He was required to subscribe certain articles, expressive of his conformity to the accustamed usages; and there is reason to think, after repeated weekly examinations, that he did subscribe, as they did not seem to involve any important article of belief.  Guided by Providence, he escaped the subtle nets of his persecutors, and at length, through the powerful friends before mentioned, became bishop of Worcester, in which function he qualified or explained away most of the papal ceremonies he was for form's sake under the necessity of complying with. He continued in this active and dignified employment some years.  Beginning afresh to set forth his plow he labored in the Lord's harvest most fruitfully, discharging his talent as well in divers places of this realm, as before the king at the court. In the same place of the inward garden, which was before applied to lascivious and courtly pastimes, there he dispensed the fruitful Word of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ, preaching there before the king and his whole court, to the edification of many.  He remained a prisoner in the Tower until the coronation of Edward VI, when he was again called to the Lord's harvest in Stamford, and many other places: he also preached at London in the convocation house, and before the young king; indeed he lectured twice every Sunday, regardless of his great age (then above sixty-seven years,) and his weakness through a bruise received from the fall of a tree. Indefatigable in his private studies, he rose to them in winter and in summer at two o'clock in the morning.  By the strength of his own mind, or of some inward light from above, he had a prophetic view of what was to happen to the Church in Mary's reign, asserting that he was doomed to suffer for the truth, and that Winchester, then in the Tower, was preserved for that purpose. Soon after Queen Mary was proclaimed, a messenger was sent to summon Mr. Latimer to town, and there is reason to believe it was wished that he should make his escape.  Thus Master Latimer coming up to London, through Smithfield (where merrily he said that Smithfield had long groaned for him), was brought before the Council, where he patiently bore all the mocks and taunts given him by the scornful papists. He was cast into the Tower, where he, being assisted with the heavenly grace of Christ, sustained imprisonment a long time, notwithstanding the cruel and unmerciful handling of the lordly papists, which thought then their kingdom would never fall; he showed himself not only patient, but also cheerful in and above all that which they could or would work against him. Yea, such a valiant spirit the Lord gave him, that he was able not only to despise the terribleness of prisons and torments, but also to laugh to scorn the doings of his enemies.  Mr. Latimer, after remaining a long time in the Tower, was transported to Oxford, with Cranmer and Ridley, the disputations at which place have been already mentioned in a former part of this work. He remained imprisoned until October, and the principal objects of all his prayers were three-that he might stand faithful to the doctrine he had professed, that God would restore his Gospel to England once again, and preserve the Lady Elizabeth to be queen; all of which happened. When he stood at the stake without the Bocardo gate, Oxford, with Dr. Ridley, and fire was putting to the pile of fagots, he raised his eyes benignantly towards heaven, and said, "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able." His body was forcibly penetrated by the fire, and the blood flowed abundantly from the heart; as if to verify his constant desire that his heart's blood might be shed in defence of the Gospel. His polemical and friendly letters are lasting monuments of his integrity and talents. It has been before said, that public disputation took place in April, 1554, new examinations took place in October, 1555, previous to the degradation and condemnation of Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer. We now draw to the conclusion of the lives of the two last.  Dr. Ridley, the night before execution, was very facetious, had himself shaved, and called his supper a marriage feast; he remarked upon seeing Mrs. Irish (the keeper's wife) weep, "Though my breakfast will be somewhat sharp, my supper will be more pleasant and sweet."  The place of death was on the northside of the town, opposite Baliol College. Dr. Ridley was dressed in a black gown furred, and Mr. Latimer had a long shroud on, hanging down to his feet. Dr. Ridley, as he passed Bocardo, looked up to see Dr. Cranmer, but the latter was then engaged in disputation with a friar. When they came to the stake, Mr. Ridley embraced Latimer fervently, and bid him: "Be of good heart, brother, for God will either assuage the fury of the flame, or else strengthen us to abide it." He then knelt by the stake, and after earnestly praying together, they had a short private conversation. Dr. Smith then preached a short sermon against the martyrs, who would have answered him, but were prevented by Dr. Marshal, the vice-chancellor. Dr. Ridley then took off his gown and tippet, and gave them to his brother-in-law, Mr. Shipside. He gave away also many trifles to his weeping friends, and the populace were anxious to get even a fragment of his garments. Mr. Latimer gave nothing, and from the poverty of his garb, was soon stripped to his shroud, and stood venerable and erect, fearless of death.  Dr. Ridley being unclothed to his shirt, the smith placed an iron chain about their waists, and Dr. Ridley bid him fasten it securely; his brother having tied a bag of gunpowder about his neck, gave some also to Mr. Latimer.  Dr. Ridley then requested of Lord Williams, of Fame, to advocate with the queen the cause of some poor men to whom he had, when bishop, granted leases, but which the present bishop refused to confirm. A lighted fagot was now laid at Dr. Ridley's feet, which caused Mr. Latimer to say: "Be of good cheer, Ridley; and play the man. We shall this day, by God's grace, light up such a candle in England, as I trust, will never be put out."  When Dr. Ridley saw the fire flaming up towards him, he cried with a wonderful loud voice, "Lord, Lord, receive my spirit." Master Latimer, crying as vehemently on the other side, "O Father of heaven, receive my soul!" received the flame as it were embracing of it. After that he had stroked his face with his hands, and as it were, bathed them a little in the fire, he soon died (as it appeareth) with very little pain or none.  Well! dead they are, and the reward of this world they have already. What reward remaineth for them in heaven, the day of the Lord's glory, when he cometh with His saints, shall declare.  In the following month died Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester and lord chancellor of England. This papistical monster was born at Bury, in Suffolk, and partly educated at Cambridge. Ambitious, cruel, and bigoted, he served any cause; he first espoused the king's part in the affair of Anne Boleyn: upon the establishment of the Reformation he declared the supremacy of the pope an execrable tenet; and when Queen Mary came to the crown, he entered into all her papistical bigoted views, and became a second time bishop of Winchester. It is conjectured it was his intention to have moved the sacrifice of Lady Elizabeth, but when he arrived at this point, it pleased God to remove him.  It was on the afternoon of the day when those faithful soldiers of Christ, Ridley and Latimer, perished, that Gardiner sat down with a joyful heart to dinner. Scarcely had he taken a few mouthfuls, when he was seized with illness, and carried to his bed, where he lingered fifteen days in great torment, unable in any wise to evacuate, and burnt with a devouring fever, that terminated in death. Execrated by all good Christians, we pray the Father of mercies, that he may receive that mercy above he never imparted below.Mr. John PhilpotThis martyr was the son of a knight, born in Hampshire, and brought up at New College, Oxford, where for several years he studied the civil law, and became eminent in the Hebrew tongue. He was a scholar and a gentleman, zealous in religion, fearless in disposition, and a detester of flattery. After visiting Italy, he returned to England, affairs in King Edward's days wearing a more promising aspect. During this reign he continued to be archdeacon of Winchester under Dr. Poinet, who succeeded Gardiner. Upon the accession of Mary, a convocation was summoned, in which Mr. Philpot defended the Reformation against his ordinary, Gardiner, again made bishop of Winchester, and soon was conducted to Bonner and other commissioners for examination, October 2, 1555, after being eighteen months' imprisoned. Upon his demanding to see the commission, Dr. Story cruelly observed, "I will spend both my gown and my coat, but I will burn thee! Let him be in Lollard's tower, (a wretched prison,) for I will sweep the king's Bench and all other prisons of these heretics!"  Upon Mr. Philpot's second examination, it was intimated to him that Dr. Story had said that the lord chancellor had commanded that he should be made away with. It is easy to foretell the result of this inquiry. He was committed to Bonner's coal house, where he joined company with a zealous minister of Essex, who had been induced to sign a bill of recantation; but afterward, stung by his conscience, he asked the bishop to let him see the instrument again, when he tore it to pieces; which induced Bonner in a fury to strike him repeatedly, and tear away part of his beard. Mr. Philpot had a private interview with Bonner the same night, and was then remanded to his bed of straw like other prisoners, in the coal house. After seven examinations, Bonner ordered him to be set in the stocks, and on the following Sunday separated him from his fellow-prisoners as a sower of heresy, and ordered him up to a room near the battlements of St. Paul's, eight feet by thirteen, on the other side of Lollard's tower, and which could be overlooked by any one in the bishop's outer gallery. Here Mr. Philpot was searched, but happily he was successful in secreting some letters containing his examinations.  In the eleventh investigation before various bishops, and Mr. Morgan, of Oxford, the latter was so driven into a corner by the close pressure of Mr. Philpot's arguments, that he said to him, "Instead of the spirit of the Gospel which you boast to possess, I think it is the spirit of the buttery, which your fellows have had, who were drunk before their death, and went, I believe, drunken to it." To this unfounded and brutish remark, Mr. Philpot indignantly replied, "It appeareth by your communication that you are better acquainted with that spirit than the Spirit of God; wherefore I tell thee, thou painted wall and hypocrite, in the name of the living God, whose truth I have told thee, that God shall rain fire and brimstone upon such blasphemers as thou art!" He was then remanded by Bonner, with an order not to allow him his Bible nor candlelight.  On December 4, Mr. Philpot had his next hearing, and this was followed by two more, making in all, fourteen conferences, previous to the final examination in which he was condemned; such were the perseverance and anxiety of the Catholics, aided by rthe argumentative abilities of the most distinguished of the papal bishops, to bring him into the pale of their Church. Those examinations, which were very long and learned, were all written down by Mr. Philpot, and a stronger proof of the imbecility of the Catholic doctors, cannot, to an unbiased mind, be exhibited.  On December 16, in the consistory of St. Paul's Bishop Bonner, after laying some trifling accusations to his charge, such as secreting powder to make ink, writing some private letters, etc., proceeded to pass the awful sentence upon him, after he and the other bishops had urged him by every inducement to recant. He was afterward conducted to Newgate, where the avaricious Catholic keeper loaded him with heavy irons, which by the humanity of Mr. Macham were ordered to be taken off. On December 17, Mr. Philpot received intimation that he was to die next day, and the next morning about eight o'clock, he joyfully met the sheriffs, who were to attend him to the place of execution.  Upon entering Smithfield, the ground was so muddy that two officers offered to carry him to the stake, but he replied:  "Would you make me a pope? I am content to finish my journey on foot." Arriving at the stake, he said, "Shall I disdain to suffer at the stake, when my Redeemer did not refuse to suffer the most vile death upon the cross for me?" He then meekly recited the One hundred and seventh and One hundred and eighth Psalms, and when he had finished his prayers, was bound to the post, and fire applied to the pile. On December 18, 1555, perished this illustrious martyr, reverenced by man, and glorified in heaven!John Lomas, Agnes Snoth, Anne Wright, Joan Sole, and Joan CatmerThese five martyrs suffered together, January 31, 1556. John Lomas was a young man of Tenterden. He was cited to appear at Catnerbury, and was examined January 17. His answers being adverse to the idolatrous doctrine of the papacy, he was condemned on the following day, and suffered January 31.  Agnes Snoth, widow, of Smarden Parish, was several times summoned before the Catholic Pharisees, and rejecting absolution, indulgences, transubstantiation, and auricular confession, she was adjudged worthy to suffer death, and endured martyrdom, January 31, with Anne Wright and Joan Sole, who were placed in similar circumstances, and perished at the same time, with equal resignation. Joan Catmer, the last of this heavenly company, of the parish Hithe, was the wife of the martyr George Catmer.  Seldom in any country, for political controversy, have four women been led to execution, whose lives were irreproachable, and whom the pity of savages would have spared. We cannot but remark here that, when the Protestant power first gained the ascendency over the Catholic superstition, and some degree of force in the laws was necessary to enforce uniformity, whence some bigoted people suffered privation in their person or goods, we read of few burnings, savage cruelties, or poor women brought to the stake, but it is the nature of error to resort to force instead of argument, and to silence truth by taking away existence, of which the Redeemer himself is an instance.  The above five persons were burnt at two stakes in one fire, singing hosannahs to the glorified Savior, until the breath of life was extinct. Sir John Norton, who was present, wept bitterly at their unmerited sufferings.Archbishop CranmerDr. Thomas Cranmer was descended from an ancient family, and was born at the village of Arselacton, in the county of Northampton. After the usual school education he was sent to Cambridge, and was chosen fellow Jesus College. Here he married a gentleman's daughter, by which he forfeited his fellowship, and became a reader in Buckingham College, placing his wife at the Dolphin Inn, the landlady of which was a relation of hers, whence arose the idle report that he was an ostler. His lady shortly after dying in childbed; to his credit he was re-chosen a fellow of the college before mentioned. In a few years after, he was promoted to be Divinity Lecturer, and appointed one of the examiners over those who were ripe to become Bachelors or Doctors in Divinity. It was his principle to judge of their qualifications by the knowledge they possessed of the Scriptures, rather than of the ancient fathers, and hence many popish priests were rejected, and others rendered much improved.  He was strongly solicited by Dr. Capon to be one of the fellows on the foundation of Cardinal Wolsey's college, Oxford, of which he hazarded the refusal. While he continued in Cambridge, the question of Henry VIII's divorce with Catharine was agitated. At that time, on account of the plague, Dr. Cranmer removed to the house of a Mr. Cressy, at Waltham Abbey, whose two sons were then educating under him. The affair of divorce, contrary to the king's approbation, had remained undecided above two or three years, from the intrigues of the canonists and civilians, and though the cardinals Campeius and Wolsey were commissioned from Rome to decide the question, they purposely protracted the sentence.  It happened that Dr. Gardiner (secretary) and Dr. Fox, defenders of the king in the above suit, came to the house of Mr. Cressy to lodge, while the king removed to Greenwich. At supper, a conversation ensued with Dr. Cranmer, who suggested that the question whether a man may marry his brother's wife or not, could be easily and speedily decided by the Word of God, and this as well in the English courts as in those of any foreign nation. The king, uneasy at the delay, sent for Dr. Gardiner and Dr. Fox to consult them, regretting that a new commission must be sent to Rome, and the suit be endlessly protracted. Upon relating to the king the conversation which had passed on the previous evening with Dr. Cranmer, his majesty sent for him, and opened the tenderness of conscience upon the near affinity of the queen. Dr. Cranmer advised that the matter should be referred to the most learned divines of Cambridge and Oxford, as he was unwilling to meddle in an affair of such weight; but the king enjoined him to deliver his sentiments in writing, and to repair for that purpose to the earl of Wiltshire's, who would accommodate him with books,a nd everything requisite for the occasion.  This Dr. Cranmer immediately did, and in his declaration not only quoted the authority of the Scriptures, of general councils, and the ancient writers, but maintained that the bishop of Rome had no authority whatever to dispense with the Word of God. The king asked him if he would stand by this bold declaration, to which replying in the affirmative, he was deputed ambassador to Rome, in conjunction with the earl of Wiltshire, Dr. Stokesley, Dr. Carne, Dr. Bennet, and others, previous to which, the marriage was discussed in most of the universities of Christendom and at home.  When the pope presented his toe to be kissed, as customary, the earl of Wiltshire and his party refused. Indeed, it is affirmed that a spaniel of the earl's attracted by the littler of the pope's toe, made a snap at it, whence his holiness drew in his sacred foot, and kicked at the offender with the other.  Upon the pope demanding the cause of their embassy, the earl presented Dr. Cranmer's book, declaring that his learned friends had come to defend it. The pope treated the embassy honorably, and appointed a day for the discussion, which he delayed, as if afraid of the issue of the investigation. The earl returned, and Dr. Cranmer, by the king's desire, visited the emperor, and was successful in bringing him over to his opinion. Upon the doctor's return to England, Dr. Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, having quitted this transitory life, Dr. Cranmer was deservedly, and by Dr. Warham's desire, elevated to that eminent station.  In this function, it may be said that he followed closely the charge of St. Paul. Diligent in duty, he rose at five in the morning, and continued in study and prayer until nine: between then and dinner, he devoted to temporal affairs. After dinner, if any suitors wanted hearing, he would determine their business with such an affability that even the defaulters were scarcely displeased. Then he would play at chess for an hour, or see others play, and at five o'clock he heard the Common Prayer read, and from this until supper he took the recreation of walking. At supper his conversation was lively and entertaining; again he walked or amused himself until nine o'clock, and then entered his study.  He ranked high in favor with King Henry, and even had the purity and the interest of the English Church deeply at heart. His mild and forgiving disposition is recorded in the following instance. An ignorant priest, in the country, had called Cranmer an ostler, and spoken very derogatory of his learning. Lord Cromwell receiving information of it, the man was sent to the Fleet, and his case was told to the archbishop by a Mr. Chertsey, a grocer, and a relation of the priest's. His grace, having sent for the offender, reasoned with him, and solicited the priest to question him on any learned subject. This the man, overcome by the bishop's good nature, and knowing his own glaring incapacity, declined, and entreated his forgiveness, which was immediately granted, with a charge to employ his time better when he returned to his parish. Cromwell was much vexed at the lenity displayed, but the bishop was ever more ready to receive injury than to retaliate in any other manner than by good advice and good offices.  At the time that Cranmer was raised to be archbishop, he was king's chaplain, and archdeacon of Taunton; he was also constituted by the pope the penitentiary general of England. It was considered by the king that Cranmer would be obsequious; hence the latter married the king to Anne Boleyn, performed her coronation, stood godfather to Elizabeth, the first child, and divorced the king from Catharine. Though Cranmer received a confirmation of his dignity from the pope, he always protested against acknowledging any other authority than the king's, and he persisted in the same independent sentiments when before Mary's commissioners in 1555.  One of the first steps after the divorce was to prevent preaching throughout his diocese, but this narrow measure had rather a political view than a religious one, as there were many who inveighed against the king's conduct. In his new dignity Cranmer agitated the question of supremacy, and by his powerful and just arguments induced the parliament to "render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's." During Cranmer's residence in Germany, 1531, he became acquainted with Ossiander, at Nuremberg, and married his niece, but left her with him while on his return to England. After a season he sent for her privately, and she remained with him until the year 1539, when the Six Articles compelled him to return her to her friends for a time.  It should be remembered that Ossiander, having obtained the approbation of his friend Cranmer, published the laborious work of the Harmony of the Gospels in 1537. In 1534 the archbishop completed the dearest wish of his heart, the removal of every obstacle to the perfection of the Reformation, by the subscription of the nobles and bishops to the king's sole supremacy. Only Bishop Fisher and Sir Thomas More made objection; and their agreement not to oppose the succession Cranmer was willing to consider at sufficient, but the monarch would have no other than an entire concession.  Not long after, Gardiner, in a privat einterview with the king, spoke inimically of Cranmer, (whom he maliciously hated) for assumiong the title of primate of all England, as derogatory to the supremacy of the king. This created much jealousy against Cranmer, and his translation of the Bible was strongly opposed by Stokesley, bishop of London. It is said, upon the demise of Queen Catharine, that her successor Anne Boleyn rejoiced-a lesson this to show how shallow is the human judgment! since her own execution took place in the spring of the following year, and the king, on the day following the beheading of this sacrificed lady, married the beautiful Jane Seymour, a maid of honor to the late queen. Cranmer was ever the friend of Anne Boleyn, but it was dangerous to oppose the will of the carnal tyrannical monarch.  In 1538, the Holy Scriptures were openly exposed to sale; and the places of worship overflowed everywhere to hear its holy doctrines expounded. Upon the king's passing into a law the famous Six Articles, which went nearly again to establish the essential tenets of the Romish creed, Cranmer shone forth with all the luster of a Christian patiot, in resisting the doctrines they contained, and in which he was supported by the bishops of Sarum, Worcester, Ely, and Rochester, the two former of whom resigned their bishoprics. The king, though now in opposition to Cranmer, still revered the sincerity that marked his conduct. The death of Lord Cromwell in the Tower, in 1540, the good friend of Cranmer, was a severe blow to the wavering Protestant cause, but even now Cranmer, when he saw the tide directly adverse to the truth, boldly waited on the king in person, and by his manly and heartfelt pleading, caused the Book of Articles to be passed on his side, to the great confusion of his enemies, who had contemplated his fall as inevitable.  Cranmer now lived in as secluded a manner as possible, until the rancor of Winchester preferred some articles against him, relative to the dangerous opinion he taught in his family, joined to other treasonable charges. These the king himself delivered to Cranmer, and believing firmly the fidelity and assertions of innocence of the accused prelate, he caused the matter to be deeply investigated, and Winchester and Dr. Lenden, with Thornton and Barber, of the bishop's household, were found by the papers to be the real conspirators. The mild, forgiving Cranmer would have interceded for all remission of publishment, had not Henry, pleased with the subsidy voted by parliament, let them be discharged. These nefarious men, however, again renewing their plots against Cranmer, fell victims to Henry's resentment, and Gardiner forever lost his confidence. Sir G. Gostwick soon after laid charges against the archbishop, which Henry quashed, and the primate was willing to forgive.  In 1544, the archbishop's palace at Canterbury was burnt, and his brother-in-law with others perished in it. These various afflictions may serve to reconcile us to a humble state; for of what happiness could this great and good man boast, since his life was constantly harassed either by political, religious, or natural crosses? Again the inveterate Gardfiner laid high charges against the meek archbishop and would have sent him to the Tower; but the king was his friend, gave him his signet that he might defend him, and in the Council not only declared the bishop one of the best affected men in his realm, but sharpoly rebuked his accusers for their calumny.  A peace having been made, Henry, and the French king, Henry the Great, were unanimous to have the Mass abolished in their kingdom, and Cranmer set about this great work; but the death of the English monarch, in 1546, suspended the precedure, and King Edwarrd his successor continued Cranmer in the same functions, upon whose coronation he delivered a charge that will ever honor his memory, for its purity, freedom, and truth. During this reign he prosecuted the glorious Reformation with unabated zeal, even in the year 1552, when he was seized with a severe ague, from which it pleased God to restore him that he might testify by his death the truth of that seed he had diligently sown.  The death of Edward, in 1553, exposed Cranmer to all the rage of his enemies. Though the archbishop was among those who supported Mary's accession, he was attainted at the meeting of parliament, and in November adjudged guilty of high treason at Guildhall, and degraded from his dignities. He sent a humble letter to Mary, explaining the cause of his signing the will in favor of Edward, and in 1554 he wrote to the Council, whom he pressed to obtain a pardon from the queen, by a letter delivered to Dr. Weston, but which the letter opened, and on seeing its contents, basely returned.  Treason was a charge quite inapplicable to Cranmer, who supported the queen's right; while others, who had favored Lady Jane were dismissed upon paying a small fine. A calumny was now spread against Cranmer that he complied with some of the popish ceremonies to ingratiate himself with the queen, which he dared publicly to disavow, and justified his articles of faith. The active part which the prelate had taken in the divorce of Mary's mother had ever rankled deeply in the heart of the queen, and revenge formed a prominent feature in the death of Cranmer.  We have in this work noticed the public disputations at Oxford, in which the talents of Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer shone so conspicuously, and tended to their condemnation. The first sentence was illegal, inasmuch as the usurped power of the pope had not yet been re-established by law.  Being kept in prison until this was effected, a commission was despatched from Rome, appointing Dr. Brooks to sit as the representative of his holiness, and Drs. Story and Martin as those of the queen. Cranmer was willing to bow to the authority of Drs. Story and Martin, but against that of Dr. Brooks he protested. Such were the remarks and replies of Cranmer, after a long examination, that Dr. Broks observed, "We come to examine you, and methinks you examine us."  Being sent back to confinement, he received a citation to appear at Rome within eighteen days, but this was impracticable, as he was imprisoned in England; and as he stated, even had he been at liberty, he was too poor to employ an advocate. Absurd as it must appear, Cranmer was condemned at Rome, and on February 14, 1556, a new commission was appointed, by which, Thirlby, bishop of Ely, and Bonner, of London, were deputed to sit in judgment at Christ-church, Oxford. By virtue of this instrument, Cranmer was gradually degraded, by putting mere rags on him to represent the dress of an archbishop; then stripping him of his attire, they took off his own gown, and put an old worn one upon him instead. This he bore unmoved, and his enemies, finding that severity only rendered him more determined, tried the opposite course, and placed him in the house of the dean of Christ-church, where he was treated with every indulgence.  This presented such a contrast to the three years' hard imprisonment he had received, that it threw him off his guard. His open, generous nature was more easily to be seduced by a liberal conduct than by threats and fetters. When Satan finds the Christian proof against one mode of attack, he tries another; and what form is so seductive as smiles, rewards, and power, after a long, painful imprisonment? Thus it was with Cranmer: his enemies promised him his former greatness if he would but recant, as well as the queen's favor, and this at the very time they knew that his death was determined in council. To soften the path to apostasy, the first paper brought for his signature was conceived in general terms; this once signed, five others were obtained as explanatory of the first, until finally he put his hand to the following detestable instrument:  "I, Thomas Cranmer, late archbishop of Canterbury, do renounce, abhor, and detest all manner of heresies and errors of Luther and Zuinglius, and all other teachings which are contrary to sound and true doctrine. And I believe most constantly in my heart, and with my mouth I confess one holy and Catholic Church visible, without which there is no salvation; and therefore I acknowledge the Bishop of Rome to be supreme head on earth, whom I acknowledge to be the highest bishop and pope, and Christ's vicar, unto whom all Christian people ought to be subject.  "And as concerning the sacraments, I believe and worship int he sacrament of the altar the body and blood of Christ, being contained most truly under the forms of bread and wine; the bread, through the mighty power of God being turned into the body of our Savior Jesus Christ, and the wine into his blood.  "And in the other six sacraments, also, (alike as in this) I believe and hold as the universal Church holdeth, and the Church of Rome judgeth and determineth.  "Furthermore, I believe that there is a place of purgatory, where souls departed be punished for a time, for whom the Church doth godily and wholesomely pray, like as it doth honor saints and make prayers to them.  "Finally, in all things I profess, that I do not otherwise believe than the Catholic Church and the Church of Rome holdeth and teacheth. I am sorry that I ever held or thought otherwise. And I beseech Almighty God, that of His mercy He will vouchsafe to forgive me whatsoever I have offended against God or His Church, and also I desire and beseech all Christian people to pray for me.  "And all such as have been deceived either by mine example or doctrine, I require them by the blood of Jesus Christ that they will return to the unity of the Church, that we may be all of one mind, without schism or division.  "And to conclude, as I submit myself to the Catholic Church of Christ, and to the supreme head thereof, so I submit myself unto the most excellent majesties of Philip and Mary, king and queen of this realm of England, etc., and to all other their laws and ordinances, being ready always as a faithful subject ever to obey them. And God is my witness, that I have not done this for favor or fear of any person, but willingly and of mine own conscience, as to the instruction of others."  "Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall!" said the apostle, and here was a falling off indeed! The papists now triumphed in their turn: they had acquired all they wanted short of his life. His recantation was immediately printed and dispersed, that it might have its due effect upon the astonished Protestants. But God counter worked all the designs of the Catholics by the extent to which they carried the implacable persecution of their prey. Doubtless, the love of life induced Cranmer to sign the above declaration: yet death may be said to have been preferable to life to him who lay under the stings of a goaded conscience and the contempt of every Gospel Christian; this principle he strongly felt in all its force and anguish.  The queen's revenge was only to be satiated by Cranmer's blood, and therefore she wrote an order to Dr. Pole, to prepare a sermon to be preached March 21, directly before his martyrdom, at St. Mary's, Oxford. Dr. Pole visited him the day previous, and was induced to believe that he would publicly deliver his sentiments in confirmation of the articles to which he had subscribed. About nine in the morning of the day of sacrifice, the queen's commissioners, attended by the magistrates, conducted the amiable unfortunate to St. Mary's Church. His torn, dirty garb, the same in which they habited him upon his degradation, excited the commiseration of the people. In the church he found a low mean stage, erected opposite to the pulpit, on which being placed, he turned his face, and fervently prayed to God.  The church was crowded with persons of both persuasions, expecting to hear the justification of the late apostasy: the Catholics rejoicing, and the Protestants deeply wounded in spirit at the deceit of the human heart. Dr. Pole, in his sermon, represented Cranmer as having been guilty of the most atrocious crimes; encouraged the deluded sufferer not to fear death, not to doubt the support of God in his torments, nor that Masses would be said in all the churches of Oxford for the repose of his soul. The doctor then noticed his conversion, and which he ascribed to the evident working of Almighty power and in order that the people might be convinced of its reality, asked the prisoner to give them a sign. This Cranmer did, and begged the congregation to pray for him, for he had committed many and grievous sins; but, of all, there was one which awfully lay upon his mind, of which he would speak shortly.  During the sermon Cranmer wept bitter tears: lifting up his hands and eyes to heaven, and letting them fall, as if unworthy to live: his grief now found vent in words: before his confession he fell upon his knees, and, in the following words unveiled the deep contrition and agitation which harrowed up his soul.  "O Father of heaven! O Son of God, Redeemer of the world! O Holy Ghost, three persons all one God! have mercy on me, most wretched caitiff and miserable sinner. I have offended both against heaven and earth, more than my tongue can express. Whither then may I go, or whither may I flee? To heaven I may be ashamed to lift up mine eyes and in earth I find no place of refuge or succor. To Thee, therefore, O Lord, do I run; to Thee do I humble myself, saying, O Lord, my God, my sins be great, but yet have mercy upon me for Thy great mercy. The great mystery that God became man, was not wrought for little or few offences. Thou didst not give Thy Son, O Heavenly Father, unto death for small sins only, but for all the greatest sins of the world, so that the sinner return to Thee with his whole heart, as I do at present. Wherefore, have mercy on me, O God, whose property is always to have mercy, have mercy upon me, O Lord, for Thy great mercy. I crave nothing for my own merits, but for Thy name's sake, that it may be hallowed thereby, and for Thy dear Son, Jesus Christ's sake. And now therefore, O Father of Heaven, hallowed be Thy name," etc.  Then rising, he said he was desirous before his death to give them some pious exhortations by which God might be glorified and themselves edified. He then descanted upon the danger of a love for the world, the duty of obedience to their majesties, of love to one another and the necessity of the rich administering to the wants of the poor. He quoted the three verses of the fifth chapter of James, and then proceeded, "Let them that be rich ponder well these three sentences: for if they ever had occasion to show their charity, they have it now at this present, the poor people being so many, and victual so dear.  "And now forasmuch as I am come to the last end of my life, whereupon hangeth all my life past, and all my life to come, either to live with my master Christ for ever in joy, or else to be in pain for ever with the wicked in hell, and I see before mine eyes presently, either heaven ready to receive me, or else hell ready to swallow me up; I shall therefore declare unto you my very faith how I believe, without any color of dissimulation: for now is no time to dissemble, whatsoever I have said or written in times past.  "First, I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, etc. And I believe every article of the Catholic faith, every word and sentence taught by our Savior Jesus Christ, His apostles and prophets, in the New and Old Testament.  "And now I come to the great thing which so much troubleth my conscience, more than any thing that ever I did or said in my whole life, and that is the setting abroad of a writing contrary to the truth, which now here I renounce and refuse, as things written with my hand contrary to the truth which I thought in my heart, and written for fear of death, and to save my life, if it might be; and that is, all such bills or papers which I have written or signed with my hand since my degradation, wherein I have written many things untrue. And forasmuch as my hand hath offended, writing contrary to my heart, therefore my hand shall first be punished; for when I come to the fire it shall first be burned.  "And as for the pope, I refuse him as Christ's enemy, and Antichrist, with all his false doctrine."  Upon the conclusion of this unexpected declaration, amazement and indignation were conspicuous in every part of the church. The Catholics were completely foiled, their object being frustrated, Cranmer, like Samson, having completed a greater ruin upon his enemies in the hour of death, than he did in his life.  Cranmer would have proceeded in the exposure of the popish doctrines, but the murmurs of the idolaters drowned his voice, and the preacher gave an order to "lead the heretic away!" The savage command was directly obeyed, and the lamb about to suffer was torn from his stand to the place of slaughter, insulted all the way by the revilings and taunts of the pestilent monks and friars.  With thoughts intent upon a far higher object than the empty threats of man, he reached the spot dyed with the blood of Ridley and Latimer. There he knelt for a short time in earnest devotion, and then arose, that he might undress and prepare for the fire. Two friars who had been parties in prevailing upon him to abjure, now endeavored to draw him off again from the truth, but he was steadfast and immovable in what he had just professed, and publicly taught. A chain was provided to bind him to the stake, and after it had tightly encircled him, fire was put to the fuel, and the flames began soon to ascend.  Then were the glorious sentiments of the martyr made manifest; then it was, that stretching out his right hand, he held it unshrinkingly in the fire until it was burnt to a cinder, even before his body wa sinjured, frequently exclaiming, "This unworthy right hand."  His body did abide the burning with such steadfastness that he seemed to have no more than the stake to which he was bound; his eyes were lifted up to heaven, and he repeated "this unworthy right hand," as long as his voice would suffer him; and using often the words of Stephen, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit," in the greatness of the flame, he gave up the ghost.The Vision of Three LaddersWhen Robert Samuel was brought forth to be burned, certain there were that heard him declare what strange things had happened unto him during the time of his imprisonment; to wit, that after he had famished or pined with hunger two or three days together, he then fell into a sleep, as it were one half in a slumber, at which time one clad all in white seemed to stand before him, who ministered comfort unto him by these words:  "Samuel, Samuel, be of good cheer, and take a good heart unto thee: for after this day shalt thou never be either hungry or thirsty."  No less memorable it is, and worthy to be noted, concerning the three ladders which he told to divers he saw in his sleep, set up toward heaven; of the which there was one somewhat longer than the rest, but yet at length they became one, joining (as it were) all three together.  As this godly martyr was going to the fire, there came a certain maid to him, which took him about the neck, and kissed him, who, being marked by them that were present, was sought for the next day after, to be had to prison and burned, as the very party herself informed me: howbeit, as God of His goodness would have it, she escaped their fiery hands, keeping herself secret in the town a good while after.  But as this maid, called Rose Nottingham, was marvellously preserved by the providence of God, so there were other two honest women who did fall into the rage and fury of that time. The one was a brewer's wife, the other was a shoemaker's wife, but both together now espoused to a new husband, Christ.  With these two was this maid aforesaid very familiar and well acquainted, who, on a time giving counsel to the one of them, that she should convey herself away while she had time and space, had this answer at her hand again: "I know well," saith she, "that it is lawful enough to fly away; which remedy you may use, if you list. But my case standeth otherwise. I am tied to a husband, and have besides young children at home; therefore I am minded, for the love of Christ and His truth, to stand to the extremity of the matter."  And so the next day after Samuel suffered, these two godly wives, the one called Anne Potten, the other called Joan Trunchfield, the wife of Michael Trunchfield, shoemaker, of Ipswich, were apprehended, and had both into one prison together. As they were both by sex and nature somewhat tender, so were they at first less able to endure the straitness of the prison; and especially the brewer's wife was cast into marvellous great agonies and troubles of mind thereby. But Christ, beholding the weak infirmity of His servant, did not fail to help her when she was in this necessity; so at the length they both suffered after Samuel, in 1556, February 19. And these, no dobut, were those two ladders, which, being joined with the third, Samuel saw stretched up into heaven. This blessed Samuel, the servant of Christ, suffered the thirty-first of August, 1555.  The report goeth among some that were there present, and saw him burn, that his body in burning did shine in the eyes of them that stood by, as bright and white as new-tried silver.  When Agnes Bongeor saw herself separated from her prison-fellows, what piteous moan that good woman made, how bitterly she wept, what strange thoughts came into her mind, how naked and desolate she esteemed herself, and into what plunge of despair and care her poor soul was brought, it was piteous and wonderful to see; which all came because she went not with them to give her life in the defence of her Christ; for of all things in the world, life was least looked for at her hands.  For that morning in which she was kept back from burning, had she put on a smock, that she had prepared only for that purpose. And also having a child, a little young infant sucking on her, whom she kept with her tenderly all the time that she was in prison, against that day likewise did she send away to another nurse, and prepared herself presently to give herself for the testimony of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ. So little did she look for life, and so greatly did God's gifts work in her above nature, that death seemed a great deal better welcome than life. After which, she began a little to stay herself, and gave her whole exercise to reading and prayer, wherein she found no little comfort.  In a short time came a writ from London for the burning, which according to the effect thereof, was executed.Hugh Laverick and John ApriceHere we perceive that neither the impotence of age nor the affliction of blindness, could turn aside the murdering fangs of these Babylonish monsters. The first of these unfortunates was of the parish of Barking, aged sixty-eight, a painter and a cripple. The other was blind, dark indeed in his visual faculties, but intellectually illuminated with the radiance of the everlasting Gospel of truth. Inoffensive objects like these were informed against by some of the sons of bigotry, and dragged before the prelatical shark of London, where they underwent examination, and replied to the articles propounded to them, as other Christian martyrs had done before. On the ninth day of May, in the consistory of St. Paul's, they were entreated to recant, and upon refusal, were sent to Fulham, where Bonner, by way of a dessert after dinner, condemned them to the agonies of the fire. Being consigned to the secular officers, May 15, 1556, they were taken in a cart from Newgate to Stratford-le-Bow, where they were fastened to the stake. When Hugh Laverick was secured by the chain, having no further occasion for his crutch, he threw it away saying to his fellow-martyr, while consoling him, "Be of good cheer my brother; for my lord of London is our good physician; he will heal us both shortly-thee of thy blindness, and me of my lameness." They sank down in the fire, to rise to immortality!  The day after the above martyrdoms, Catharine Hut, of Bocking, widow; Joan Horns, spinster, of Billerica; Elizabeth Thackwel, spinster, of Great Burstead, suffered death in Smithfield.  Thomas Dowry. We have again to record an act of unpitying cruelty, exercised on this lad, whom Bishop Hooper, had confirmed in the Lord and the knowledge of his Word.  How long this poor sufferer remained in prison is uncertain.  By the testimony of one John Paylor, register of Gloucester, we learn that when Dowry was brought before Dr. Williams, then chancellor of Gloucester, the usual articles were presented him for subscription. From these he dissented; and, upon the doctor's demanding of whom and where he had learned his heresies, the youth replied, "Indeed, Mr. Chancellor, I learned from you in that very pulpit. On such a day (naming the day) you said, in preaching upon the Sacrament, that it was to be exercised spiritually by faith, and not carnally and really, as taught by the papists." Dr. Williams then bid him recant, as he had done; but Dowry had not so learned his duty. "Though you," said he, "can so easily mock God, the world, and your own conscience, yet will I not do so."Preservation of George Crow and His TestamentThis poor man, of Malden, May 26, 1556, put to sea, to lade in Lent with fuller's earth, but the boat, being driven on land, filled with water, and everything was washed out of her; Crow, however, saved his Testament, and coveted nothing else. With Crow was a man and a boy, whose awful situation became every minute more alarming, as the boat was useless, and they were ten miles from land, expecting the tide should in a few hours set in upon them. After prayer to God, they got upon the mast, and hung there for the space of ten hours, when the poor boy, overcome by cold and exhaustion, fell off, and was drowned. The tide having abated, Crow proposed to take down the masts, and float upon them, which they did; and at ten o'clock at night they were borne away at the mercy of the waves. On Wednesday, in the night, Crow's companion died through the fatigue and hunger, and he was left alone, calling upon God for succor. At length he was picked up by a Captain Morse, bound to Antwerp, who had nearly steered away, taking him for some fisherman's buoy floating in the sea. As soon as Crow was got on board, he put his hand in his bosom, and drew out his Testament, which indeed was wet, but not otherwise injured. At Antwerp he was well received, and the money he had lost was more than made good to him.Executions at Stratford-le-BowAt this sacrifice, which we are about to detail no less than thirteen were doomed to the fire.  Each one refusing to subscribe contrary to conscience, they were condemned, and the twenty-seventh of June, 1556, was appointed for their execution at Stratford-le-Bow. Their constancy and faith glorified their Redeemer, equally in life and in death.Rev. Julius PalmerThis gentleman's life presents a singular instance of error and conversion. In the time of Edward, he was a rigid and obstinate papist, so adverse to godly and sincere preaching, that he was even despised by his own party; that this frame of mind should be changed, and he suffer persecution and death in Queen Mary's reign, are among those events of omnipotence at which we wonder and admire.  Mr. Palmer was born at Coventry, where his father had been mayor. Being afterward removed to Oxford, he became, under Mr. Harley, of Magdalen College, an elegant Latin and Greek scholar. He was fond of useful disputation, possessed of a lively wit, and a strong memory. Indefatigable in private study, he rose at four in the morning, and by this practice qualified himself to become reader in logic in Magralen College. The times of Edward, however, favoring the Reformation, Mr. Palmer became frequently punished for his contempt of prayer and orderly behavior, and was at length expelled the house.  He afterwards embraced the doctrines of the Reformation, which occasioned his arrest and final condemnation.  A certain nobleman offered him his life if he would recant.  "If so," said he, "thou wilt dwell with me. And if thou wilt set thy mind to marriage, I will procure thee a wife and a farm, and help to stuff and fit thy farm for thee. How sayst thou?"  Palmer thanked him very courteously, but very modestly and reverently concluded that as he had already in two places renounced his living for Christ's sake, so he would with God's grace be ready to surrender and yield up his life also for the same, when God should send time.  When Sir Richard perceived that he would by no means relent:  "Well, Palmer," saith he, "then I perceive one of us twain shall be damned: for we be of two faiths, and certain I am there is but one faith that leadeth to life and salvation."  Palmer: "O sir, I hope that we both shall be saved."Sir Richard: "How may that be?"Palmer: "Right well, sir. For as it hath pleased our merciful Savior, according to the Gospel's parable, to call me at the third hour of the day, even in my flowers, at the age of four and twenty years, even so I trust He hath called, and will call you, at the eleventh hour of this your old age, and give you everlasting life for your portion."  Sir Richard: "Sayest thou so? Well, Palmer, well, I would I might have thee but one month in my house: I doubt not but I would convert thee, or thou shouldst convert me."  Then said Master Winchcomb, "Take pity on thy golden years, and pleasant flowers of lusty youth, before it be too late."  Palmer: "Sir, I long for those springing flowers that shall never fade away."  He was tried on the fifteenth of July, 1556, together with one Thomas Askin, fellow prisoner. Askin and one John Guin had been sentenced the day before, and Mr. Palmer, on the fifteenth, was brought up for final judgment. Execution was ordered to follow the sentence, and at five o'clock in the same afternoon, at a place called the Sand-pits, these three martyrs were fastened to a stake. After devoutly praying together, they sung the Thirty-first Psalm.  When the fire was kindled, and it had seized their bodies, without an appearance of enduring pain, they continued to cry, "Lord Jesus, strengthen us! Lord Jesus receive our souls!" until animation was suspended and human suffering was past. It is remarkable, that, when their heads had fallen together in a mass as it were by the force of the flames, and the spectators thought Palmer as lifeless, his tongue and lips again moved, and were heard to pronounce the name of Jesus, to whom be glory and honor forever!Joan Waste and OthersThis poor, honest woman, blind from her birth, and unmarried, aged twenty-two, was of the parish of Allhallows, Derby. Her father was a barber, and also made ropes for a living: in which she assisted him, and also learned to knit several articles of apparel. Refusing to communicate with those who maintained doctrines contrary to those she had learned in the days of the pious Edward, she was called before Dr. Draicot, the chancellor of Bishop Blaine, and Peter Finch, official of Derby.  With sophisitcal arguments and threats they endeavored to confound the poor girl; but she proffered to yield to the bishop's doctrine, if he would answer for her at the Day of Judgment, (as pious Dr. Taylor had done in his sermons) that his belief of the real presence of the Sacrament was true. The bishop at first answered that he would; but Dr. Draicot reminding him that he might not in any way answer for a heretic, he withdrew his confirmation of his own tenets; and she replied that if their consciences would not permit them to answer at God's bar for that truth they wished her to subscribe to, she would answer no more questions. Sentence was then adjudged, and Dr. Draicot appointed to preach her condemned sermon, which took place August 1, 1556, the day of her martyrdom. His fulminating discourse being finished, the poor, sightless object was taken to a place called Windmill Pit, near the town, where she for a time held her brother by the hand, and then prepared herself for the fire, calling upon the pitying multitude to pray with her, and upon Christ to have mercy upon her, until the glorious light of the everlasting Sun of righteousness beamed upon her departed spirit.  In November, fifteen martyrs were imprisoned in Canterbury castle, of whom all were either burnt or famished. Among the latter were J. Clark, D. Chittenden, W. Foster of Stonc, Alice Potkins, and J. Archer, of Cranbrooke, weaver. The two first of these had not received condemnation, but the others were sentenced to the fire. Foster, at his examination, observed upon the utility of carrying lighted candles about on Candlemas-day, that he might as well carry a pitchfork; and that a gibbet would have as good an effect as the cross.  We have now brought to a close the sanguinary proscriptions of the merciless Mary, in the year 1556, the number of which amounted to above EIGHTY-FOUR!  The beginning of the year 1557, was remarkable for the visit of Cardinal Pole to the University of Cambridge, which seemed to stand in need of much cleansing from heretical preachers and reformed doctrines. One object was also to play the popish farce of trying Martin Bucer and Paulus Phagius, who had been buried about three or four years; for which purpose the churches of St. Mary and St. Michael, where they lay, were interdicted as vile and unholy places, unfit to worship God in, until they were perfumed and washed with the pope's holy water, etc., etc. The trumpery act of citing these dead reformers to appear, not having had the least effect upon them, on January 26, sentence of condemnation was passed, part of which ran in this manner, and may serve as a specimen of proceedings of this nature: "We therefore pronounce the said Martin Bucer and Paulus Phagius excommunicated and anathematized, as well by the common law, as by letters of process; and that their memory be condemned, we also condemn their bodies and bones (which in that wicked time of schism, and other heresies flourishing in this kingdom, were rashly buried in holy ground) to be dug up, and cast far from the bodies and bones of the faithful, according to the holy canons, and we command that they and their writings, if any be there found, be publicly burnt; and we interdict all persons whatsoever of this university, town, or places adjacent, who shall read or conceal their heretical book, as well by the common law, as by our letters of process!"  After the sentence thus read, the bishop commanded their bodies to be dug out of their graves, and being degraded from holy orders, delivered them into the hands of the secular power; for it was not lawful for such innocent persons as they were, abhorring all bloodshed, and detesting all desire of murder, to put any man to death.  February 6, the bodies, enclosed as they were in chests, were carried into the midst of the market place at Cambrdige, accompanied by a vast concourse of people. A great post was set fast in the ground, to which the chests were affixed with a large iron chain, and bound round their centers, in the same manner as if the dead bodies had been alive. When the fire began to ascend, and caught the coffins, a number of condemned books were also launched into the flames, and burnt. Justice, however, was done to the memories of these pious and learned men in Queen Elizabeth's reign, when Mr. Ackworth, orator of the university, and Mr. J. Pilkington, pronounced orations in honor of their memory, and in reprobation of their Catholic persecutors.  Cardinal Pole also inflicted his harmless rage upon the dead body of Peter Martyr's wife, who, by his command, was dug out of her grave, and buried on a distant dunghill, partly because her bones lay near St. Fridewide's relics, held once in great esteem in that college, and partly because he wished to purify Oxford of heretical remains as well as Cambridge. In the succeeding reign, however, her remains were restored to their former cemetery, and even intermingled with those of the Catholic saint, to the utter astonishment and mortification of the disciples of his holiness the pope.  Cardinal Pole published a list of fifty-four articles, containing instructions to the clergy of his diocese of Canterbury, some of which are too ludicrous and puerile to excite any other sentiment than laughter in these days.Persecutions in the Diocese of CanterburyIn the month of February, the following persons were committed to prison: R. Coleman, of Waldon, laborer; Joan Winseley, of Horsley Magna, spinster; S. Glover, of Rayley; R. Clerk, of Much Holland, mariner; W. Munt, of Much Bentley, sawyer; Marg. Field, of Ramsey, spinster; R. Bongeor, currier; R. Jolley, mariner;  Allen Simpson, Helen Ewire, C. Pepper, widow; Alice Walley (who recanted), W. Bongeor, glazier, all of Colchester; R. Atkin, of Halstead, weaver; R. Barcock, of Wilton, carpenter; R. George, of Westbarhonlt, laborer; R. Debnam of Debenham, weaver; C. Warren, of Cocksall, spinster; Agnes Whitlock, of Dover-court, spinster;  Rose Allen, spinster; and T. Feresannes, minor; both of Colchester.  These persons were brought before Bonner, who would have immediately sent them to execution, but Cardinal Pole was for more merciful measures, and Bonner, in a letter of his to the cardinal, seems to be sensible that he had displeased him, for he has this expression: "I thought to have them all hither to Fulham, and to have given sentence against them; nevertheless, perceiving by my last doing that your grace was offended, I thought it my duty, before I proceeded further, to inform your grace." This circumstance verifies the account that the cardinal was a humane man; and though a zealous Catholic, we, as Protestants, are willing to render him that honor which his merciful character deserves. Some of the bitter persecutors denounced him to the pope as a favorer of heretics, and he was summoned to Rome, but Queen Mary, by particular entreaty, procured his stay. However, before his latter end, and a little before his last journey from Rome to England, he was strongly suspected of favoring the doctrine of Luther.  As in the last sacrifice four women did honor to the truth, so in the following auto da fe we have the like number of females and males, who suffered June 30, 1557, at Canterbury, and were J. Fishcock, F. White, N. Pardue, Barbary Final, widow, Bardbridge's widow, Wilson's wife, and Benden's wife.  Of this group we shall more particularly notice Alice Benden, wife of Edward Bender, of Staplehurst, Kent. She had been taken up in October, 1556, for non-attendance, and released upon a strong injunction to mind her conduct. Her husband was a bigoted Catholic, and publicly speaking of his wife's contumacy, she was conveyed to Canterbury Castle, where knowing, when she should be removed to the bishop's prison, she should be almost starved upon three farthings a day, she endeavored to prepare herself for this suffering by living upon twopence halfpenny per day.  On January 22, 1557, her husband wrote to the bishop that if his wife's brother, Roger Hall, were to be kept from consoling and relieving her, she might turn; on this account, she was moved to a prison called Monday's Hole. Her brother sought diligently for her, and at the end of five weeks providentially heard her voice in the dungeon, but could not otherwise relieve her, than by putting soe money in a loaf, and sticking it on a long pole. Dreadful must have been the situation of this poor victim, lying on straw, between stone walls, without a change of apparel, or the meanest requisites of cleanliness, during a period of nine weeks!  On March 25 she was summoned before the bishop, who, with rewards, offered her liberty if she would go home and be comfortable; but Mrs. Benden had been inured to suffering, and, showing him her contracted limbs and emaciated appearance, refused to swerve from the truth. She was however removed from this black hole to the West Gate, whence, about the end of April, she was taken out to be condemned, and then committed to the castle prison until the nineteenth of June, the day of her burning. At the stake, she gave her handkerchief to one John Banks, as a memorial; and from her waist she drew a white lace, desiring him to give it to her brother, and tell him that it was the last band that had bound her, except the chain; and to her father she returned a shilling he had sent her.  The whole of these seven martyrs undressed themselves with alacrity, and, being prepared, knelt down, and prayed with an earnestness and Christian spirit that even the enemies of the cross were affected. After invocation made together, they were secured to the stake, and, being encompassed with the unsparing flames, they yielded their souls into the hands of the living Lord.  Matthew Plaise, weaver, a sincere and shrewd Christian, of Stone, Kent, was brought before Thomas, bishop of Dover, and other inquisitors, whom he ingeniously teased by his indirect answers, of which the following is a specimen.  Dr. Harpsfield. Christ called the bread His body; what dost thou say it is? Plaise. I do believe it was that which He gave them. Dr. H. What as that? P. That which He brake. Dr. H. What did He brake? P. That which He took. Dr. H. What did He take? P. I say, what He gave them, that did they eat indeed. Dr. H. Well, then, thou sayest it was but bread which the disciples did eat. P. I say, what He gave them, that did they eat indeed.  A very long disputation followed, in which Plaise was desired to humble himself to the bishop; but this he refused. Whether this zealous person died in prison, was executed, or delivered, history does not mention.Rev. John HullierRev. John Hullier was brought up at Eton College, and in process of time became curate of Babram, three miles from Cambridge, and went afterward to Lynn; where, opposing the superstition of the papists, he was carried before Dr. Thirlby, bishop of Ely, and sent to Cambridge castle: here he lay for a time, and was then sent to Tolbooth prison, where, after three months, he was brought to St. Mary's Church, and condemned by Dr. Fuller. On Maunday Thursday he was brought to the stake: while undressing, he told the people to bear witness that he was about to suffer in a just cause, and exhorted them to believe that there was no other rock than Jesus Christ to build upon. A priest named Boyes, then desired the mayor to silence him. After praying, he went meekly to the stake, and being bound with a chain, and placed in a pitch barrel, fire was applied to the reeds and wood; but the wind drove the fire directly to his back, which caused him under the severe agony to pray the more fervently. His friends directed the executioner to fire the pile to windward of his face, which was immediately done.  A quantity of books were now thrown into the fire, one of which (the Communion Service) he caught, opened it, and joyfully continued to read it, until the fire and smoke deprived him of sight; then even, in earnest prayer, he pressed the book to his heart, thanking God for bestowing on him in his last moments this precious gift.  The day being hot, the fire burnt fiercely; and at a time when the spectators supposed he was no more, he suddenly exclaimed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit," and meekly resigned his life. He was burnt on Jesus Green, not far from Jesus College. He had gunpowder given him, but he was dead before it became ignited. This pious sufferer afforded a singular spectacle; for his flesh was so burnt from the bones, which continued erect, that he presented the idea of a skeleton figure chained to the stake. His remains were eagerly seized by the multitude, and venerated by all who admired his piety or detested inhuman bigotry.Simon Miller and Elizabeth CooperIn the following month of July, received the crown of martyrdom. Miller dwelt at Lynn, and came to Norwich, where, planting himself at the door of one of the churches, as the people came out, he requested to know of them where he could go to receive the Communion. For this a priest brought him before Dr. Dunning, who committed him to ward; but he was suffered to go home, and arrange his affairs; after which he returned to the bishop's house, and to his prison, where he remained until the thirteenth of July, the day of his burning.  Elizabeth Coope, wife of a pewterer, of St. Andrews, Norwich, had recanted; but tortured for what she had done by the worm which dieth not, she shortly after voluntarily entered her parish church during the time of the popish service, and standing up, audibly proclaimed that she revoked her former recantation, and cautioned the people to avoid her unworthy example. She was taken from her own house by Mr. Sutton the sheriff, who very reluctantly complied with the letter of the law, as they had been servants and in friendship together. At the stake, the poor sufferer, feeling the fire, uttered the cry of "Oh!" upon which Mr. Miller, putting his hand behind him towards her, desired her to be of a good courage, "for (said he) good sister, we shall have a joyful and a sweet supper." Encouraged by this example and exhortation, she stood the fiery ordeal without flinching, and, with him, proved the power of faith over the flesh.Executions at ColchesterIt was before mentioned that twenty-two persons had been sent up from Colchester, who upon a slight submission, were afterward released. Of these, William Munt, of Much Bentley, husbandman, with Alice, his wife, and Rose Allin, her daughter, upon their return home, abstained from church, which induced the bigoted priest secretly to write to Bonner. For a short time they absconded, but returniong again, March 7, one Edmund Tyrrel, (a relation of the Tyrrel who murdered King Edward V and his brother) with the officers, entered the house while Munt and his wife were in bed, and informed them that they must go to Colchester Castle. Mrs. Munt at that time being very ill, requested her daughter to get her some drink; leave being permitted, Rose took a candle and a mug; and in returning through the house was met by Tyrrel, who cautioned her to advise her parents to become good Catholics. Rose briefly informed him that they had the Holy Ghost for their adviser; and that she was ready to lay down her own life for the same cause. Turning to his company, he remarked that she was willing to burn; and one of them told him to prove her, and see what she would do by and by. The unfeeling wretch immediately executed this project; and, seizing the young woman by the wrist, he held the lighted candle under her hand, burning it crosswise on the back, until the tendons divided from the flesh, during which he loaded her with many opprobrious epithets. She endured his rage unmoved, and then, when he had ceased the torture, she asked him to begin at her feet or head, for he need not fear that his employer would one day repay him. After this she took the drink to her mother.  This cruel act of torture does not stand alone on record.  Bonner had served a poor blind harper in nearly the same manner, who had steadily maintained a hope that if every joint of him were to be burnt, he should not fly from the faith. Bonner, upon this, privately made a signal to his men, to bring a burning coal, which they placed in the poor man's hand, and then by force held it closed, until it burnt into the flesh deeply.  George Eagles, tailor, was indicted for having prayed that 'God would turn Queen Mary's heart, or take her away'; the ostensible cause of his death was his religion, for treason could hardly be imagined in praying for the reformation of such an execrable soul as that of Mary. Being condemned for this crime, he was drawn to the place of execution upon a sledge, with two robbers, who were executed with him. After Eagles had mounted the ladder, and been turned off a short time, he was cut down before he was at all insensible; a bailiff, named William Swallow, then dragged him to the sledge, and with a common blunt cleaver, hacked off the head; in a manner equally clumsy and cruel, he opened his body and tore out the heart.  In all this suffering the poor martyr repined not, but to the last called upon his Savior. The fury of these bigots did not end here; the intestines were burnt, and the body was quartered, the four parts being sent to Colchester, Harwich, Chelmsford, and St. Rouse's. Chelmsford had the honor of retaining his head, which was affixed to a long pole in the market place. In time it was blown down, and lay several days in the street, until it was buried at night in the churchyard. God's judgment not long after fell upon Swallow, who in his old age became a beggar, and who was affected with a leprosy that made him obnoxious even to the animal creation; nor did Richard Potts, who troubled Eagles in his dying moments, escape the visiting hand of God.Mrs. Joyce LewesThis lady was the wife of Mr. T. Lewes, of Manchester. She had received the Romish religion as true, until the burning of that pious martyr, Mr. Saunders, at Coventry. Understanding that his death arose from a refusal to receive the Mass, she began to inquire into the ground of his refusal, and her conscience, as it began to be enlightened, became restless and alarmed. In this inquietude, she resorted to Mr. John Glover, who lived near, and requested that he would unfold those rich sources of Gospel knowledge he possessed, particularly upon the subject of transubstantiation. He easily succeeded in convincing her that the mummery of popery and the Mass were at variance with God's most holy Word, and honestly reproved her for following too much the vanities of a wicked world. It was to her indeed a word in season, for she soon became weary of her former sinful life and resolved to abandon the Mass and dilatrous worship. Though compelled by her husband's violence to go to church, her contempt of the holy water and other ceremonies was so manifest, that she was accused before the bishop for despising the sacramentals.  A citation, addressed to her, immediately followed, which was given to Mr. Lewes, who, in a fit of passion, held a dagger to the throat of the officer, and made him eat it, after which he caused him to drink it down, and then sent him away. But for this the bishop summoned Mr. Lewest before him as well as his wife; the former readily submitted, but the latter resolutely affirmed, that, in refusing holy water, she neither offended God, nor any part of his laws. She was sent home for a month, her husband being bound for her appearance, during which time Mr. Glover impressed upon her the necessity of doing what she did, not from self-vanity, but for the honor and glory of God.  Mr. Glover and others earnestly exhorted Lewest to forfeit the money he was bound in, rather than subject his wife to certain death; but he was deaf to the voice of humanity, and delivered her over to the bishop, who soon found sufficient cause to consign her to a loathsome prison, whence she was several times brought for examination. At the last time the bishop reasoned with her upon the fitness of her coming to Mass, and receiving as sacred the Sacrament and sacramentals of the Holy Ghost. "If these things were in the Word of God," said Mrs. Lewes, "I would with all my heart receive, believe, and esteem them." The bishop, with the most ignorant and impious effrontery, replied, "If thou wilt believe no more than what is warranted by Scriptures, thou art in a state of damnation!" Astonished at such a declaration, this worthy sufferer ably rejoined that his words were as impure as they were profane.  After condemnation, she lay a twelvemonth in prison, the sheriff not being willing to put her to death in his time, though he had been but just chosen. When her death warrant came from London, she sent for some friends, whom she consulted in what manner her death might be more glorious to the name of God, and injurious to the cause of God's enemies. Smilingly, she said: "As for death, I think but lightly of. When I know that I shall behold the amiable countenance of Christ my dear Savior, the ugly face of death does not much trouble me." The evening before she suffered, two priests were anxious to visit her, but she refused both their confession and absolution, when she could hold a better communication with the High Priest of souls. About three o'clock in the morning, Satan began to shoot his fiery darts, by putting into her mind to doubt whether she was chosen to eternal life, and Christ died for her. Her friends readily pointed out to her those consolatory passages of Scripture which comfort the fainting heart, and treat of the Redeemer who taketh away the sins of the world.  About eight o'clock the sheriff announced to her that she had but an hour to live; she was at first cast down, but this soon passed away, and she thanked God that her life was about to be devoted to His service. The sheriff granted permission for two friends to accompany her to the stake-an indulgence for which he was afterward severely handled. Mr. Reniger and Mr. Bernher led her to the place of execution; in going to which, from its distance, her great weakness, and the press of the people, she had nearly fainted. Three times she prayed fervently that God would deliver the land from popery and the idolatrous Mass; and the people for the most part, as well as the sheriff, said Amen.  When she had prayed, she took the cup, (which had been filled with water to refresh her,) and said, "I drink to all them that unfeignedly love the Gospel of Christ, and wish for the abolition of popery." Her friends, and a great many women of the place, drank with her, for which most of them afterward were enjoined penance.  When chained to the stake, her countenance was cheerful, and the roses of her cheeks were not abated. Her hands were extended towards heaven until the fire rendered them powerless, when her soul was received int o the arms of the Creator. The duration of her agony was but short, as the under-sheriff, at the request of her friends, had prepared such excellent fuel that she was in a few minutes overwhelmed with smoke and flame. The case of this lady drew a tear of pity from everyone who had a heart not callous to humanity.Executions at IslingtonAbout the seventeenth of September, suffered at Islington the following four professors of Christ: Ralph Allerton, James Austoo, Margery Austoo, and Richard Roth.  James Austoo and his wife, of St. Allhallows, Barking, London, were sentenced for not believing in the presence. Richard Roth rejected the seven Sacraments, and was accused of comforting the heretics by the following letter written in his own blood, and intended to have been sent to his friends at Colchester:  "O dear Brethren and Sisters, "How much reason have you to rejoice in God, that He hath given you such faith to overcome this bloodthirsty tyrant thus far! And no doubt He that hath begun that good work in you, will fulfill it unto the end. O dear hearts in Christ, what a crown of glory shall ye receive with Christ in the kingdom of God! O that it had been the good will of God that I had been ready to have gone with you; for I lie in my lord's Little-ease by day, and in the night I lie in the Coalhouse, apart from Ralph Allerton, or any other; and we look every day when we shall be condemned; for he said that I should be burned within ten days before Easter; but I lie still at the pool's brink, and every man goeth in before me; but we abide patiently the Lord's leisure, with many bonds, in fetters and stocks, by which we have received great joy of God. And now fare you well, dear brethren and sisters, in this world, but I trust to see you in the heavens face to face. "O brother Munt, with your wife and my sister Rose, how blessed are you in the Lord, that God hath found you worthy to suffer for His sake! with all the rest of my dear brethren and sisters known and unknown. O be joyful even unto death. Fear it not, saith Christ, for I have overcome death. O dear heart, seeing that Jesus Christ will be our help, O tarry you the Lord's leisure. Be strong, let your hearts be of good comfort, and wait you still for the Lord. He is at hand. Yea, the angel of the Lord pitcheth his tent round about them that fear him, and delivereth them which way he seeth best. For our lives are in the Lord's hands; and they can do nothing unto us before God suffer them. Therefore give all thanks to God. "O dear hearts, you shall be clothed in long white garments upon the mount of Sion, with the multitude of saints, and with Jesus Christ our Savior, who will never forsake us. O blessed virgins, ye have played the wise virgins' part, in that ye have taken oil in your lamps that ye may go in with the Bridegroom, when he cometh, into the everlasting joy with Him. But as for the foolish, they shall be shut out, because they made not themselves ready to suffer with Christ, neither go about to take up His cross. O dear hearts, how precious shall your death be in the sight of the Lord! for dear is the death of His saints. O fare you well, and pray. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen, Amen. Pray, pray, pray! "Written by me, with my own blood,"RICHARD ROTH."This letter, so justly denominating Bonner the "bloodthirsty tyrant," was not likely to excite his compassion. Roth accused him of bringing them to secret examination by night, because he was afraid of the people by day. Resisting every temptation to recant, he was condemned, and on September 17, 1557, these four martyrs perished at Islington, for the testimony of the Lamb, who was slain that they might be of the redeemed of God.  John Noyes, a shoemaker, of Laxfield, Suffolk, was taken to Eye, and at midnight, September 21, 1557, he was brought from Eye to Laxfield to be burned. On the following morning he was led to the stake, prepared for the horrid sacrifice. Mr. Noyes, on coming to the fatal spot, knelt down, prayed, and rehearsed the Fiftieth Psalm. When the chain enveloped him, he said, "Fear not them that kill the body, but fear him that can kill both body and soul, and cast it into everlasting fire!" As one Cadman placed a fagot against him, he blessed the hour in which he was born to die for the truth; and while trusting only upon the all-sufficient merits of the Redeemer, fire was set to the pile, and the blazing fagots in a short time stifled his last words, "Lord, have mercy on me! Christ, have mercy upon me!" The ashes of the body were buried in a pit, and with them one of his feet, whole to the ankle, with the stocking on.Mrs. Cicely OrmesThis young martyr, aged twenty-two, was the wife of Mr. Edmund Ormes, worsted weaver of St. Lawrence, Norwich. At the death of Miller and Elizabeth Cooper, before mentioned, she had said that she would pledge them of the same cup they drank of. For these words she was brought to the chanellor, who would have discharged her upon promising to go to church, and to keep her belief to herself. As she would not consent to this, the chancellor urged that he had shown more lenity to her than any other person, and was unwilling to condemn her, because she was an ignorant foolish woman; to this she replied, (perhaps with more shrewdness than he expected,) that however great his desire might be to spare her sinful flesh, it could not equal her inclination to surrender it up in so great a quarrel. The chancellor then pronounced the fiery sentence, and September 23, 1557, she was brought to the stake, at eight o'clock in the morning.  After declaring her faith to the people, she laid her hand on the stake, and said, "Welcome, thou cross of Christ." Her hand was sooted in doing this, (for it was the same stake at which Miller and Cooper were burnt,) and she at first wiped it; but directly after again welcomed and embraced it as the "sweet cross of Christ." After the tormentors had kindled the fire, she said, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit doth rejoice in God my Savior." Then crossing her hands upon her breast, and looking upwards with the utmost serenity, she stood the fiery furnace. Her hands continued gradually to rise until the sinews were dried, and then they fell. She uttered no sigh of pain, but yielded her life, an emblem of that celestial paradise in which is the presence of God, blessed forever.  It might be contended that this martyr voluntarily sought her own death, as the chancellor scarcely exacted any other penance of her than to keep her belief to herself; yet it should seem in this instance as if God had chosen her to be a shining light, for a twelve-month before she was taken, she had recanted; but she was wretched until the chancellor was informed, by letter, that she repented of her recantation from the bottom of her heart. As if to compensate for her former apostasy, and to convince the Catholics that she meant to more to compromise for her personal security, she boldly refused his friendly offer of permitting her to temporize. Her courage in such a cause deserves commendation-the cause of Him who has said, "Whoever is ashamed of me on earth, of such will I be ashamed in heaven."Rev. John RoughThis pious martyr was a Scotchman. At the age of seventeen, he entered himself as one of the order of Black Friars, at Stirling, in Scotland. He had been kept out of an inheritance by his friends, and he took this step in revenge for their conduct to him. After being there sixteen years, Lord Hamilton, earl of Arran, taking a liking to him, the archbishop of St. Andrew's induced the provincial of the house to dispense with his habit and order; and he thus became the earl's chaplain. He remained in this spiritual employment a year, and in that time God wrought in him a saving knowledge of the truth; for which reason the earl sent him to preach in the freedom of Ayr, where he remained four years; but finding danger there from the religious complexion of the times, and learning that there was much Gospel freedom in England, he travelled up to the duke of Somerset, then Lord Protector of England, who gave him a yearly salary of twenty pounds, and authorized him, to preach at Carlisle, Berwick, and Newcastle, where he married. He was afterward removed to a benefice at Hull, in which he remained until the death of Edward VI.  In consequence of the tide of persecution then setting in, he fled with his wife to Friesland, and at Nordon they followed the occupation of knitting hose, caps, etc., for subsistence. Impeded in his business by the want of yarn, he came over to England to procure a quantity, and on November 10, arrived in London, where he soon heard of a secret society of the faithful, to whom he joined himself, and was in a short time elected their minister, in which occupation he strengthened them in every good resolution.  On December 12, through the information of one Taylor, a member of the society, Mr. Rough, with Cuthbert Symson and others, was taken up in the Saracen's Head, Islington, where, under the pretext of coming to see a play, their religious exercises were holden. The queen's vice-chamberlain conducted Rough and Symson before the Council, in whose presence they were charged with meeting to celebrate the Communion. The Council wrote to Bonner and he lost no time in this affair of blood. In three days he had him up, and on the next (the twentieth) resolved to condemn him. The charges laid against him were, that he, being a priest, was married, and that he had rejected the service in the Latin tongue. Rough wanted not arguments to reply to these flimsy tenets. In short, he was degraded and condemned.    Mr. Rough, it should be noticed, when in the north, in Edward VI's reign, had saved Dr. Watson's life, who afterward sat with Bishop Bonner on the bench. This ungrateful prelate, in return for the kind act he had received, boldly accused Mr. Rough of being the most pernicious heretic in the country. The godly minister reproved him for his malicious spirit; he affirmed that, during the thirty years he had lived, he had never bowed the knee to Baal; and that twice at Rome he had seen the pope born about on men's shoulders with the false-named Sacrament carried before him, presenting a true picture of the very Antichrist; yet was more reverence shown to him than to the wafer, which they accounted to be their God. "Ah?" said Bonner, rising, and making towards him, as if he would have torn his garment, "Hast thou been at Rome, and seen our holy father the pope, and dost thou blaspheme him after this sort?" This said, he fell upon him, tore off a piece of his beard, and that the day might begin to his own satisfaction, he ordered the object of his rage to be burnt by half-past five the following morning.Cuthbert SymsonFew professors of Christ possessed more activity and zeal than this excellent person. He not only labored to preserve his friends from the contagion of popery, but he labored to guard them against the terrors of persecution. He was deacon of the little congregation over which Mr. Rough presided as minister.  Mr. Symson has written an account of his own sufferings, which he cannot detail better than in his own words:  "On the thirteenth of December, 1557, I was committed by the Council to the Tower of London. On the following Thursday, I was called into the ward-room, before the constable of the Tower, and the recorder of London, Mr. Cholmly, who commanded me to inform them of the names of those who came to the English service. I answered that I would declare nothing; in consequence of my refusal, I was set upon a rack of iron, as I judge for the space of three hours! "They then asked me if I would confess: I answered as before. After being unbound, I was carried back to my lodging. The Sunday after I was brought to the same place again, before the lieutenant and recorder of London, and they examined me. As I had answered before, so I answered now. Then the lieutenant swore by God I should tell; after which my two forefingers were bound together, and a small arrow placed between them, they drew it through so fast that the blood followed, and the arrow brake. "After enduring the rack twice again, I was retaken to my lodging, and ten days after the lieutenant asked me if I would not now confess that which they had before asked of me. I answered, that I had already said as much as I would. Three weeks after I was sent to the priest, where I was greatly assaulted, and at whose hand I received the pope's curse, for bearing witness of the resurrection of Christ. And thus I commend you to God, and to the Word of His grace, with all those who unfeignedly call upon the name of Jesus; desiring God of His endless mercy, through the merits of His dear Son Jesus Christ, to bring us all to His everlasting Kingdom, Amen. I praise God for His great mercy shown upon us. Sing Hosanna to the Highest with me, Cuthbert Symson. God forgive my sins! I ask forgiveness of all the world, and I forgive all the world, and thus I leave the world, in the hope of a joyful resurrection!"  If this account be duly considered, what a picture of repeated tortures does it present! But even the cruelty of the narration is exceeded by the patient meekness with which it was endured. Here are no expressions of malice, no invocations even of God's retributive justice, not a complaint of suffering wrongfully! On the contrary, praise to God, forgiveness of sin, and a forgiving all the world, concludes this unaffected interesting narrative.  Bonner's admiration was excited by the steadfast coolness of this martyr. Speaking of Mr. Symson in the consistory, he said, "You see what a personable man he is, and then of his patience, I affirm, that, if he were not a heretic, he is a man of the greatest patience that ever came before me. Thrice in one day has he been racked in the Tower; in my house also he has felt sorrow, and yet never have I seen his patience broken."  The day before this pious deacon was to be condemned, while in the stocks in the bishop's coal-house, he had the vision of a glorified form, which much encouraged him. This he certainly attested to his wife, to Mr. Austen, and others, before his death.  With this ornament of the Christian Reformation were apprehended Mr. Hugh Foxe and John Devinish; the three were brought before Bonner, March 19, 1558, and the papistical articles tendered. They rejected them, and were all condemned. As they worshipped together in the same society, at Islington, so they suffered together in Smithfield, March 28; in whose death the God of Grace was glorified, and true believers confirmed!Thomas Hudson, Thomas Carman, and William SeamenWere condemned by a bigoted vicar of Aylesbury, named Berry.  The spot of execution was called Lollard's Pit, without Bishipsgate, at Norwich. After joining together in humble petition to the throne of grace, they rose, went to the stake, and were encircled with their chains. To the great surprise of the spectators, Hudson slipped from under his chains, and came forward. A great opinion prevailed that he was about to recant; others thought that he wanted further time. In the meantime, his companions at the stake urged every promise and exhortation to support him. The hopes of the enemies of the cross, however, were disappointed: the good man, far from fearing the smallest personal terror at the approaching pangs of death, was only alarmed thathis Savior's face seemed to be hidden from him. Falling upon his knees, his spirit wrestled with God, and God verified the words of His Son, "Ask, and it shall be given." The martyr rose in an ecstasy of joy, and exclaimed, "Now, I thank God, I am strong! and care not what man can do to me!" With an unruffled countenance he replaced himself under the chain, joined his fellow-sufferers, and with them suffered death, to the comfort of the godly, and the confusion of Antichrist.  Berry, unsatiated with this demoniacal act, summoned up two hundred persons in the town of Aylesham, whom he compelled to kneel to the cross at Pentecost, and inflicted other punishments. He struck a poor man for a trifling word, with a flail, which proved fatal to the unoffending object. He also gave a woman named Alice Oxes, so heavy a blow with his fist, as she met him entering the hall when he was in an ill-humor, that she died with the violence. This priest was rich, and possessed great authority; he was a reprobate, and, like the priesthood, he abstained from marriage, to enjoy the more a debauched and licentious life. The Sunday after the death of Queen Mary, he was revelling with one of his concubines, before vespers; he then went to church, administered baptism, and in his return to his lascivious pastime, he was smitten by the hand of God. Without a moment given for repentance, he fell to the ground, and a groan was the only articulation permitted him. In him we may behold the difference between the end of a martyr and a persecutor.The Story of Roger HollandIn a retired close near a field, in Islington, a company of decent persons had assembled, to the number of forty. While they were religiously engaged in praying and expounding the Scripture, twenty-seven of them were carried before Sir Roger Cholmly. Some of the women made their escape, twenty-two were committed to Newgate, who continued in prison seven weeks. Previous to their examination, they were informed by the keeper, Alexander, that nothing more was requisite to procure their discharge, than to hear Mass. Easy as this condition may seem, these martyrs valued their purity of conscience more than loss of life or property; hence, thirteen were burnt, seven in Smithfield, and six at Brentford; two died in prison, and the other seven were providentially preserved. The names of the seven who suffered were, H. Pond, R. Estland, R. Southain, M. Ricarby, J. Floyd, J. Holiday, and Roger Holland. They were sent to Newgate, June 16, 1558, and executed on the twenty-seventh.  This Roger Holland, a merchant-tailor of London, was first an apprentice with one Master Kemption, at the Black Boy in Watling Street, giving himself to dancing, fencing, gaming, banqueting, and wanton company. He had received for his master certain money, to the sum of thirty pounds; and lost every groat at dice. Therefore he purposed to convey himself away beyond the seas, either into France or into Flanders.  With this resolution, he called early in the morning on a discreet servant in the house, named Elizabeth, who professed the Gospel, and lived a life that did honor to her profession. To her he revealed the loss his folly had occasioned, regretted that he had not followed her advice, and begged her to give his master a note of hand from him acknowledging the debt, which he would repay if ever it were in his power; he also entreated his disgraceful conduct might be kept secret, lest it would bring the gray hairs to his father with sorrow to a premature grave.  The maid, with a generosity and Christian principle rarely surpassed, conscious that his imprudence might be his ruin, brought him the thirty pounds, which was part of a sum of money recently left her by legacy. "Here," said she, "is the sum requisite: you shall take the money, and I will keep the note; but expressly on this condition, that you abandon all lewd and vicious company; that you neither swear nor talk immodestly, and game no more; for, should I learn that you do, I will immediately show this note to your master. I also require, that you shall promise me to attend the daily lecture at Allhallows, and the sermon at St. Paul's every Sunday; that you cast away all your books of popery, and in their place substitute the Testament and the Book of Service, and that you read the Scriptures with reverence and fear, calling upon God for his grace to direct you in his truth. Pray also fervently to God, to pardon your former offences, and not to remember the sins of your youth, and would you obtain his favor ever dread to break his laws or offend his majesty. So shall God have you in His keeping, and grant you your heart's desire." We must honor the memory of this excellent domestic, whose pious endeavors were equally directed to benefit the thoughtless youth in this life and that which is to come. God did not suffer the wish of this excellent domestic to be thrown upon a barren soil; within half a year after the licentious Holland became a zealous professor of the Gospel, and was an instrument of conversion to his father and others whom he visited in Lancashire, to their spiritual comfort and reformation from popery.  His father, pleased with his change of conduct, gave him forty pounds to commence business with in London.  Then Roger repaired to London again, and came to the maid that lent him the money to pay his master withal, and said unto her, "Elizabeth, here is thy money I borrowed of thee; and for the friendship, good will, and the good counsel I have received at thy hands, to recompense thee I am not able, otherwise than to make thee my wife." And soon after they were married, which was in the first year of Queen Mary.  After this he remained in the congregations of the faithful, until, the last year of Queen Mary, he, with the six others aforesaid, were taken.  And after Roger Holland there was none suffered in Smithfield for the testimony of the Gospel, God be thanked.Flagellations by BonnerWhen this Catholic hyena found that neither persuasions, threats, nor imprisonment, could produce any alteration in the mind of a youth named Thomas Hinshaw, he sent him to Fulham, and during the first night set him in the stocks, with no other allowance than bread and water. The following morning he came to see if this punishment had worked any change in his mind, and finding none, he sent Dr. Harpsfield, his archdeacon, to converse with him. The doctor was soon out f humor at his replies, called him peevish boy, and asked him if he thought he went about to damn his soul? "I am persuaded," said Thomas, "that you labor to promote the dark kingdom of the devil, not for the love of the truth." These words the doctor conveyed to the bishop, who, in a passion that almost prevented articulation, came to Thomas, and said, "Dost thou answer my archdeacon thus, thou naughty boy? But I'll soon handle thee well enough for it, be assured!" Two willow twigs were then brought him, and causing the unresisting youth to kneel against a long bench, in an arbor in his garden, he scourged him until he was compelled to cease for want of breath and fatigue. One of the rods was worn quite away.  Many other conflicts did Hinsaw undergo from the bishop; who, at length, to remove him effectually, procured false witnesses to lay articles against him, all of which the young man denied, and, in short, refused to answer any interrogatories administered to him. A fortnight after this, the young man was attacked by a burning ague, and at the request of his master. Mr. Pugson, of St. Paul's church-yard, he was removed, the bishop not doubting that he had given him his death in the natural way; he however remained ill above a year, and in the mean time Queen Mary died, by which act of providence he escaped Bonner's rage.  John Willes was another faithful person, on whom the scourging hand of Bonner fell. He was the brother of Richard Willes, before mentioned, burnt at Brentford. Hinshaw and Willes were confined in Bonner's coal house together, and afterward removed to Fulham, where he and Hinshaw remained during eight or ten days, in the stocks. Bonner's persecuting spirit betrayed itself in his treatment of Willes during his examinations, often striking him on the head with a stick, seizing him by the ears, and filliping him under the chin, saying he held down his head like a thief. This producing no signs of recantation, he took him into his orchard, and in a small arbor there he flogged him first with a willow rod, and then with birch, until he was exhausted. This cruel ferocity arose from the answer of the poor sufferer, who, upon being asked how long it was since he had crept to the cross, replied, 'Not since he had come to years of discretion, nor would he, though he should be torn to pieces by wild horses.' Bonner then bade him make the sign of the cross on his forehead, which he refused to do, and thus was led to the orchard.  One day, when in the stocks, Bonner asked him how he liked his lodging and fare. "Well enough," said Willes, "might I have a little straw to sit or lie upon." Just at this time came in Willes' wife, then largely pregnant, and entreated the bishop for her husband, boldly declaring that she would be delivered in the house, if he were not suffered to go with her. To get rid of the good wife's importunity, and the trouble of a lying-in woman in his palace, he bade Willes make the sign of the cross, and say, In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, Amen. Willes omitted the sign, and repeated the words, "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen." Bonner would have the words repeated in Latin, to which Willes made no objection, knowing the meaning of the words. He was then permitted to go home with his wife, his kinsman Robert Rouze being charged to bring him to St. Paul's the next day, whither he himself went, and subscribing to a Latin instrument of little importance, was liberated. This is the last of the twenty-two taken at Islington.Rev. Richard YeomanThis devout aged person was curate to Dr. Taylor, at Hadley, and eminently qualified for his sacred function. Dr. Taylor left him the curacy at his departure, but no sooner had Mr. Newall gotten the benefice, than he removed Mr. Yeoman, and substituted a Romish priest. After this he wandered from place to place, exhorting all men to stand faithfully to God's Word, earnestly to give themselves unto prayer, with patience to bear the cross now laid upon them for their trial, with boldness to confess the truth before their adversaries, and with an undoubted hope to wait for the crown and reward of eternal felicity. But when he perceived his adversaries lay wait for him, he went into Kent, and with a little packet of laces, pins, points, etc., he travelled from village to village, selling such things, and in this manner subsisted himself, his wife, and children.  At last Justice Moile, of Kent, took Mr. Yeoman, and set him in the stocks a day and a night; but, having no evident matter to charge him with, he let him go again. Coming secretly again to Hadley, he tarried with his poor wife, who kept him privately, in a chamber of the town house, commonly called the Guildhall, more than a year. During this time the good old father abode in a chamber locked up all the day, spending his time in devout prayer, in reading the Scriptures, and in carding the wool which his wife spun. His wife also begged bread for herself and her children, by which precarious means they supported themselves. Thus the saints of God sustained hunger and misery, while the prophets of Baal lived in festivity, and were costily pampered at Jezebel's table.  Information being at length given to Newall, that Yeoman was secreted by his wife, he came, attended by the constables, and broke into the room where the object of his search lay in bed with his wife. He reproached the poor woman with being a whore, and would have indecently pulled the clothes off, but Yeoman resisted both this act of violence and the attack upon his wife's character, adding that he defied the pope and popery. He was then taken out, and set in stocks until day.  In the cage also with him was an old man, named John Dale, who had sat there three or four days, for exhorting the people during the time service was performing by Newall and his curate. His words were, "O miserable and blind guides, will ye ever be blind leaders of the blind? Will ye never amend? Will ye never see the truth of God's Word? Will neither God's threats nor promises enter into your hearts? Will the blood of the martyrs nothing mollify your stony stomachs? O obdurate, hard-hearted, perverse, and crooked generation! to whom nothing can do good."  These words he spake in fervency of spirit agains tthe superstitious religion of Rome; wherefore Newall caused him forthwith to be attached, and set in the stocks in a cage, where he was kept until Sir Henry Doile, a justice, came to Hadley.  When Yeoman was taken, the parson called earnestly upon Sir Henry Doile to send them both to prison. Sir Henry Doile as earnestly entreated the parson to consider the age of the men, and their mean condition; they were neither persons of note nor preachers; wherefore he proposed to let them be punished a day or two and to dismiss them, at least John Dale, who was no priest, and therefore, as he had so long sat in the cage, he thought it punishment enough for this time. When the parson heard this, he was exceedingly mad, and in a great rage called them pestilent heretics, unfit to live in the commonwealth of Christians.  Sir Henry, fearing to appear too merciful, Yeoman and Dale were pinioned, bound like thieves with their legs under the horses' bellies, and carried to Bury jail, where they were laid in irons; and because they continually rebuked popery, they were carried into the lowest dungeon, where John Dale, through the jail-sickness and evil-keeping, died soon after: his body was thrown out, and buried in the fields. He was a man of sixty-six years of age, a weaver by occupation, well learned in the holy Scriptures, steadfast in his confession of the true doctrines of Christ as set forth in King Edward's time; for which he joyfully suffered prison and chains, and from this worldly dungeon he departed in Christ to eternal glory, and the blessed paradise of everlasting felicity.  After Dale's death, Yeoman was removed to Norwich prison, where, after strait and evil keeping, he was examined upon his faith and religion, and required to submit himself to his holy father the pope. "I defy him, (quoth he), and all his detestable abomination: I will in no wise have to do with him." The chief articles objected to him, were his marriage and the Mass sacrifice. Finding he continued steadfast in the truth, he was condemned, degraded, and not only burnt, but most cruelly tormented in the fire. Thus he ended this poor and miserable life, and entered into that blessed bosom of Abraham, enjoying with Lazarus that rest which God has prepared for His elect.Thomas BenbridgeMr. Benbridge was a single gentleman, in the diocese of Winchester. He might have lived a gentleman's life, in the wealthy possessions of this world; but he chose rather to enter through the strait gate of persecution to the heavenly possession of life in the Lord's Kingdom, than to enjoy present pleasure with disquietude of conscience. Manfully standing against the papists for the defence of the sincere doctrine of Christ's Gospel, he was apprehended as an adversary to the Romish religion, and led for examination before the bishop of Winchester, where he underwent several conflicts for the truth against the bishop and his colleague; for which he was condemned, and some time after brought to the place of martyrdom by Sir Richard Pecksal, sheriff.  When standing at the stake he began to untie his points, and to prepare himself; then he gave his gown to the keeper, by way of fee. His jerkin was trimmed with gold lace, which he gave to Sir Richard Pecksal, the high sheriff. His cap of velvet he took from his head, and threw away. Then, lifting his mind to the Lord, he engaged in prayer.  When fastened to the stake, Dr. Seaton begged him to recant, and he should have his pardon; but when he saw that nothing availed, he told the people not to pray for him unless he would recant, no more than they would pray for a dog.  Mr. Benbridge, standing at the stake with his hands together in suchj a manner as the priest holds his hands in his Memento, Dr. Seaton came to him again, and exhorted him to recant, to whom he said, "Away, Babylon, away!" One that stood by said, "Sir, cut his tongue out"; another, a temporal man, railed at him worse than Dr. Seaton had done.  When they saw he would not yield, they bade the tormentors to light the pile, before he was in any way covered with fagots. The fire first took away a piece of his beard, at which he did not shrink. Then it came on the other side and took his legs, and the nether stockings of his hose being leather, they made the fire pierce the sharper, so that the intolerable heat made him exclaim, "I recant!" and suddenly he trust the fire from him. Two or three of his friends being by, wished to save him; they stepped to the fire to help remove it, for which kindness they were sent to jail. The sheriff also of his own authority took him from the stake, and remitted him to prison, for which he was sent to the Fleet, and lay there sometime. Before, however, he was taken from the stake, Dr. Seaton wrote articles for him to subscribe to. To these Mr. Benbridge made so many objections that Dr. Seaton ordered them to set fire again to the pile. Then with much pain and grief of heart he subscribed to them upon a man's back.  This done, his gown was given him again, and he was led to prison. While there, he wrote a letter to Dr. Seaton, recanting those words he had spoken at the stake, and the articles which he had subscribed, for he was grieved that he had ever signed them. The same day se'night he was again brought to the stake, where the vile tormentors rather broiled than burnt him. The Lord give his enemies repentance!Mrs. PrestFrom the number condemned in this fanatical reign, it is almost impossible to obtain the name of every martyr, or to embellish the history of all with anecdotes and exemplifications of Christian conduct. Thanks be to Providence, our cruel task begins to draw towards a conclusion, with the end of the reign of papal terror and bloodshed. Monarchs, who sit upon thrones possessed by hereditary right, should, of all others, consider that the laws of nature are the laws of God, and hence that the first law of nature is the preservation of their subjects. Maxims of persecutions, of torture, and of death, they should leave to those who have effected sovereignty by fraud or by sword; but where, except among a few miscreant emperors of Rome, and the Roman pontiffs, shall we find one whose memory is so "damned to everlasting fame" as that of Queen Mary? Nations bewail the hour which separates them forever from a beloved governor, but, with respect to that of Mary, it was the most blessed time of her whole reign. Heaven has ordained three great scourges for national sins-plague, pestilence, and famine. It was the will of God in Mary's reign to bring a fourth upon this kingdom, under the form of papistical persecution. It was sharp, but glorious; the fire which consumed the martyrs has undermined the popedom; and the Catholic states, at present the most bigoted and unenlightened, are those which are sunk lowest in the scale of moral dignity and political consequence. May they remain so, until the pure light of the Gospel shall dissipate the darkness of fanaticism and superstition! But to return.  Mrs. Prest for some time lived about Cornwall, where she had a husband and children, whose bigotry compelled her to frequent the abominations of the Church of Rome. Resolving to act as her conscience dictated, she quitted them, and made a living by spinning. After some time, returning home, she was accused by her neighbors, and brought to Exeter, to be examined before Dr. Troubleville, and his chancellor Blackston. As this martyr was accounted of inferior intellect, we shall put her in competition with the bishop, and let the reader judge which had the most of that knowledge conducive to everlasting life. The bishop bringing the question to issue, respecting the bread and wine being flesh and blood, Mrs. Prest said, "I will demand of you whether you can deny your creed, which says, that Christ doth perpetually sit at the right hand of His Father, both body and soul, until He come again; or whether He be there in heaven our Advocate, and to make prayer for us unto God His Father? If He be so, He is not here on earth in a piece of bread. If He be not here, and if He do not dwell in temples made with hands, but in heaven, what! shall we seek Him here? If He did not offer His body once for all, why make you a new offering? If with one offering He made all perfect, why do you with a false offering make all imperfect? If He be to be worshipped in spirit and in truth, why do you worship a piece of bread? If He be eaten and drunken in faith and truth, if His flesh be not profitable to be among us, why do you say you make His flesh and blood, and say it is profitable for body and soul? Alas! I am a poor woman, but rather than to do as you do, I would live no longer. I have said, Sir."  Bishop. I promise you, you are a jolly Protestant. I pray you in what school have you been brought up? Mrs. Prest. I have upon the Sundays visited the sermons, and there have I learned such things as are so fixed in my breast, that death shall not separate them. B. O foolish woman, who will waste his breath upon thee, or such as thou art? But how chanceth it that thou wentest away from thy husband? If thou wert an honest woman, thou wouldst not have left thy husband and children, and run about the country like a fugitive. Mrs. P. Sir, I labored for my livingl; and as my Master Christ counselleth me, when I was persecuted in one city, I fled into another. B. Who persecuted thee? Mrs. P. My husband and my children. For when I would have them to leave idolatry, and to worship God in heaven, he would not hear me, but he with his children rebuked me, and troubled me. I fled not for whoredom, nor for theft, but because I would be no partaker with him and his of that foul idol the Mass; and wheresoever I was, as oft as I could, upon Sundays and holydays. I made excuses not to go to the popish Church. B. Belike then you are a good housewife, to fly from your husband the Church. Mrs. P. My housewifery is but small; but God gave me grace to go to the true Church. B. The true Church, what dost thou mean? Mrs. P. Not your popish Church, full of idols and abominations, but where two or three are gathered together in the name of God, to that Church will I go as long as I live. B. Belike then you have a church of your own. Well, let this mad woman be put down to prison until we send for her husband. Mrs. P. No, I have but one husband, who is here already in this city, and in prison with me, from whom I will never depart.  Some persons present endeavoring to convince the bishop she was not in her right senses, she was permitted to depart. The keeper of the bishop's prisons took her into his house, where she either spun worked as a servant, or walked about the city, discoursing upon the Sacrament of the altar. Her husband was sent for to take her home, but this she refused while the cause of religion could be served. She was too active to be idle, and her conversation, simple as they affected to think her, excited the attention of several Catholic priests and friars. They teased her with questions, until she answered them angrily, and this excited a laugh at her warmth.  "Nay," said she, "you have more need to weep than to laugh, and to be sorry that ever you were born, to be the chaplains of that whore of Babylon. I defy him and all his falsehood; and get you away from me, you do but trouble my conscience. You would have me follow your doings; I will first lose my life. I pray you depart."  "Why, thou foolish woman," said they, "we come to thee for thy profit and soul's health." To which she replied, "What profit ariseth by you, that teach nothing but lies for truth? how save you souls, when you preach nothing but lies, and destroy souls?"  "How provest thou that?" said they.  "Do you not destroy your souls, when you teach the people to worship idols, stocks, and stones, the works of men's hands? and to worship a false God of your own making of a piece of bread, and teach that the pope is God's vicar, and hath power to forgive sins? and that there is a purgatory, when God's Son hath by His passion purged all? and say you make God and sacrifice Him, when Christ's body was a sacrifice once for all? Do you not teach the people to number their sins in your ears, and say they will be damned if they confess not all; when God's Word saith, Who can number his sins? Do you not promise them trentals and dirges and Masses for souls, and sell your prayers for money, and make them buy pardons, and trust to such foolish inventions of your imaginations? Do you not altogether act against God? Do you not teach us to pray upon beads, and to pray unto saints, and say they can pray for us? Do you not make holy water and holy bread to fray devils? Do you not do a thousand more abominations? And yet you say, you come for my profit, and to save my soul. No, no, one hath saved me. Farewell, you with your salvation."  During the liberty granted her by the bishop, before-mentioned, she went into St. Peter's Church, and there found a skilful Dutchman, who was affixing new noses to certain fine images which had been disfigured in King Edward's time; to whom she said, "What a madman art thou, to make them new noses, which within a few days shall all lose their heads?" The Dutchman accused her and laid it hard to her charge. And she said unto him, "Thou art accursed, and so are thy images." He called her a whore. "Nay," said she, "thy images are whores, and thou art a whore-hunter; for doth not God say, 'You go a whoring after strange gods, figures of your own making? and thou art one of them.'" After this she was ordered to be confined, and had no more liberty.  During the time of her imprisonment, many visited her, some sent by the bishop, and some of their own will, among these was one Daniel, a great preacher of the Gospel, in the days of King Edward, about Cornwall and Devonshire, but who, through the grievous persecution he had sustained, had fallen off. Earnestly did she exhort him to repent with Peter, and to be more constant in his profession.  Mrs. Walter Rauley and Mr. William and John Kede, persons of great respectability, bore ample testimony of her godly conversation, declaring, that unless God were with her, it were impossible she could have so ably defended the cause of Christ. Indeed, to sum up the character of this poor woman, she united the serpent and the dove, abounding in the highest wisdom joined to the greatest simplicity. She endured imprisonment, threatenings, taunts, and the vilest epithets, but nothing could induce her to swerve; her heart was fixed; she had cast anchor; nor could all the wounds of persecution remove her from the rock on which her hopes of felicity were built.  Such was her memory, that, without learning, she could tell in what chapter any text of Scripture was contained: on account of this singular property, one Gregory Basset, a rank papist, said she was deranged, and talked as a parrot, wild without meaning. At length, having tried every manner without effect to make her nominally a Catholic, they condemned her. After this, one exhorted her to leave her opinions, and go home to her family, as she was poor and illiterate. "True, (said she) though I am not learned, I am content to be a witness of Christ's death, and I pray you make no longer delay with me; for my heart is fixed, and I will never say otherwise, nor turn to your superstitious doing."  To the disgrace of Mr. Blackston, treasurer of the church, he would often send for this poor martyr from prison, to make sport for him and a woman whom he kept; putting religious questions to her, and turning her answers into ridicule. This done, he sent her back to her wretched dungeon, while he battened upon the good things of this world.  There was perhaps something simply ludicrous in the form of Mrs. Prest, as she was of a very short stature, thick set, and about fifty-four years of age; but her countenance was cheerful and lively, as if prepared for the day of her marriage with the Lamb. To mock at her form was an indirect accusation of her Creator, who framed her after the fashion He liked best, and gave her a mind that far excelled the transient endowments of perishable flesh. When she was offered money, she rejected it, "because (said she) I am going to a city where money bears no mastery, and while I am here God has promised to feed me."  When sentence was read, condemning her to the flames, she lifted up her voice and praised God, adding, "This day have I found that which I have long sought." When they tempted her to recant, "That will I not, (said she) God forbid that I should lose the life eternal, for this carnal and short life. I will never turn from my heavenly husband to my earthly husband; from the fellowship of angels to mortal children; and if my husband and children be faithful, then am I theirs. God is my father, God is my mother, God is my sister, my brother, my kinsman; God is my friend, most faithful."  Being delivered to the sheriff, she was led by the officer to the place of execution, without the walls of Exeter, called Sothenhey, where again the superstitious priests assaulted her. While they were tying her to the stake, she continued earnestly to exclaim "God be merciful to me, a sinner!" Patiently enduring the devouring conflagration, she was consumed to ashes, and thus ended a life which in unshaken fidelity to the cause of Christ, was not surpassed by that of any preceding martyr.Richard Sharpe, Thomas Banion, and Thomas HaleMr. Sharpe, weaver, of Bristol, was brought the ninth day of March, 1556, before Dr. Dalby, chancellor of the city of Bristol, and after examination concerning the Sacrament of the altar, was persuaded to recant; and on the twenty-ninth, he was enjoined to make his recantation in the parish church. But, scarcely had he publicly avowed his backsliding, before he felt in his conscience such a tormenting fiend, that he was unable to work at his occupation; hence, shortly after, one Sunday, he came into the parish church, called Temple, and after high Mass, stood up in the choir door, and said with a loud voice, "Neighbors, bear me record that yonder idol (pointing to the altar) is the greatest and most abominable that ever was; and I am sorry that ever I denied my Lord God!" Notwithstanding the constables were ordered to apprehend him, he was suffered to go out of the church; but at night he was apprehended and carried to Newgate. Shortly after, before the chancellor, denying the Sacrament of the altar to be the body and blood of Christ, he was condemned to be burned by Mr. Dalby. He was burnt the seventh of May, 1558, and died godly, patiently, and constantly, confessing the Protestant articles of faith.With him suffered Thomas Hale, shoemaker, of Bristol, who was condemned by Chcnallor Dalby. These martyrs were bound back to back.  Thomas Banion, a weaver, was burnt on August 27, of the same year, and died for the sake of the evangelical cause of his Savior.J. Corneford, of Wortham; C. Browne, of Maidstone; J. Herst, of Ashford; Alice Snoth, and Catharine Knight, an Aged WomanWith pleasure we have to record that these five martyrs were the last who suffered in the reign of Mary for the sake of the Protestant cause; but the malice of the papists was conspicuous in hastening their martyrdom, which might have been delayed until the event of the queen's illness was decided. It is reported that the archdeacon of Canterbury, judging that the sudden death of the queen would suspend the execution, travelled post from London, to have the satisfaction of adding another page to the black list of papistical sacrifices.  The articles against them were, as usual, the Sacramental elements and the idolatry of bending to images. They quoted St. John's words, "Beware of images!" and respecting the real presence, they urged according to St. Paul, "the things which are seen are temporal." When sentence was about to be read against them, and excommunication to take place in the regular form, John Corneford, illuminated by the Holy Spirit, awfully turned the latter proceeding against themselves, and in a solemn impressive manner, recriminated their excommunication in the following words: "In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the most mighty God, and by the power of His Holy Spirit, and the authority of His holy Catholic and apostolic Church, we do here give into the hands of Satan to be destroyed, the bodies of all those blasphemers and heretics that maintain any error against His most holy Word, or do condemn His most holy truth for heresy, to the maintenance of any false church or foreign religion, so that by this Thy just judgment, O most mighty God, against Thy adversaries, Thy true religion may be known to Thy great glory and our comfort and to the edifying of all our nation. Good Lord, so be it. Amen."  This sentence was openly pronounced and registered, and, as if Providence had awarded that it should not be delivered in vain, within six days after, Queen Mary died, detested by all good men and accursed of God!  Though acquainted with these circumstances, the archdeacon's implacability exceeded that of his great exemplary, Bonner, who, though he had several persons at that time under his fiery grasp, did not urge their deaths hastily, by which delay he certainly afforded them an opportunity of escape. At the queen's decease, many were in bonds: some just taken, some examined, and others condemned. The writs indeed were issued for several burnings, but by the death of the three instigators of Protestant murder-the chancellor, the bishop, and the queen, who fell nearly together, the condemned sheep were liberated, and lived many years to praise God for their happy deliverance.  These five martyrs, when at the stake, earnestly prayed that their blood might be the last shed, nor did they pray in vain. They died gloriously, and perfected the number God had selected to bear witness of the truth in this dreadful reign, whose names are recorded in the Book of Life; though last, not least among the saints made meet for immortality through the redeeming blood of the Lamb!  Catharine Finlay, alias Knight, was first converted by her son's expounding the Scriptures to her, which wrought in her a perfect work that terminated in martyrdom. Alice Snoth at the stake sent for her grandmother and godfather, and rehearsed to them the articles of her faith, and the Commandments of God, thereby convincing the world that she knew her duty. She died calling upon the spectators to bear witness that she was a Christian woman, and suffered joyfully for the testimony of Christ's Gospel.  Among the numberless enormities committed by the merciless and uhnfeeling Bonner, the murder of this innocent and unoffending child may be ranged as the most horrid. His father, John Fetty, of the parish of Clerkenwell, by trade a tailor, and only twenty-four years of age, had made blessed election; he was fixed secure in eternal hope, and depended on Him who so builds His Church that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. But alas! the very wife of his bosom, whose heart was hardened against the truth, and whose mind was influenced by the teachers of false doctrine, became his accuser. Brokenbery, a creature of the pope, and parson of the parish, received the information of this wedded Delilah, in consequence of which the poor man was apprehended. But here the awful judgment of an ever-righteous God, who is "of purer eyes than to behold evil," fell upon this stone-hearted and perfidious woman; for no sooner was the injured husband captured by her wicked contriving, than she also was suddenly seized with madness, and exhibited an awful and awakening instance of God's power to punish the evil-doer. This dreadful circumstance had some effect upon the hearts of the ungodly hunters who had eagerly grasped their prey; but, in a relenting moment, they suffered him to remain with his unworthy wife, to return her good for evil, and to comfort two children, who, on his being sent to prison, would have been left without a protector, or have become a burden to the parish. As bad men act from little motives, we may place the indulgence shown him to the latter account.  We have noticed in the former part of our narratives of the martyrs, some whose affection would have led them even to sacrifice their own lives, to preserve their husbands; but here, agreeable to Scripture language, a mother proves, indeed, a monster in nature! Neither conjugal nor maternal affection could impress the heart of this disgraceful woman.  Although our afflicted Christian had experienced so much cruelty and falsehood from the woman who was bound to him by every tie both human and divine, yet, with a mild and forbearing spirit, he overlooked her misdeeds, during her calamity endeavoring all he could to procure relief for her malady, and soothing her by every possible expression of tenderness: thus she became in a few weeks nearly restored to her senses. But, alas! she returned again to her sin, "as a dog returneth to his vomit." Malice against the saints of the Most High was seated in her heart too firmly to be removed; and as her strength returned, her inclination to work wickedness returned with it. Her heart was hardened by the prince of darkness; and to her may be applied these afflicting and soul-harrowing words, "Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil." Weighing this text duly with another, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy," how shall we presume to refine away the sovereignty of God by arrainging Jehovah at the bar of human reason, which, in religious matters, is too often opposed by infinite wisdom? "Broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat. Narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it." The ways of heaven are indeed inscrutable, and it is our bounden duty to walk ever dependent on God, looking up to Him with humble confidence, and hope in His goodness, and ever confess His justice; and where we "cannot unravel, there learn to trust." This wretched woman, pursuing the horrid dictates of a heart hardened and depraved, was scarcely confirmed in her recovery, when, stifling the dictates of honor, gratitude, and every natural affection, she again accused her husband, who was once more apprehended, and taken before Sir John Mordant, knight, and one of Queen Mary's commissioners.  Upon examination, his judge finding him fixed in opinions which militated against those nursed by superstition and maintained by cruelty, he was sentenced to confinement and torture in Lollard's Tower. Here he was put into the painful stocks, and had a dish of water set by him, with a stone put into it, to what purpose God knoweth,e xcept it were to show that he should look for little other subsistence: which is credible enough, if we consider their like practices upon divers before mentioned in this history; as, among others, upon Richard Smith, who died through their cruel imprisonment touching whom, when a godly woman came to Dr. Story to have leave she might bury him, he asked her if he had any straw or blood in his mouth; but what he means thereby, I leave to the judgment of the wise.  On the first day of the third week of our martyr's sufferings, an object presented itself to his view, which made him indeed feel his tortures with all their force, and to execrate, with bitterness only short of cursing, the author of his misery. To mark and punish the proceedings of his tormentors, remained with the Most High, who noteth even the fall of a sparrow, and in whose sacred Word it is written, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay." This object was his own son, a child of the tender age of eight years. For fifteen days, had its hapless father been suspended by his tormentor by the right arm and left leg, and sometimes by both, shifting his positions for the purpose of giving him strength to bear and to lengthen the date of his sufferings. When the unoffending innocent, desirous of seeing and speaking to its parent, applied to Bonner for permission to do so, the poor child being asked by the bishop's chaplain the purport of his errand, he replied he wished to see his father. "Who is thy father?" said the chaplain. "John Fetty," returned the boy, at the same time pointing to the place where he was confined. The interrogating miscreant on this said, "Why, thy father is a heretic!" The little champion again rejoined, with energy sufficient to raise admiration in any breast, except that of this unprincipled and unfeeling wretch-this miscreant, eager to execute the behests of a remoseless queen-"My father is no heretic: for you have Balaam's mark."  Irritated by reproach so aptly applied, the indignant and mortified priest concealed his resentment for a moment, and took the undaunted boy into the house, where having him secure, he presented him to others, whose baseness and cruelty being equal to his own, they stripped him to the skin, and applied their scourges to so violent a degree, that, fainting beneath the stripes inflicted on his tender frame, and covered with the blood that flowed from them, the victim of their ungodly wrath was ready to expire under his heavy and unmerited punishment.  In this bleeding and helpless state was the suffering infant, covered only with his shirt, taken to his father by one of the actors in the horrid tragedy, who, while he exhibited the heart-rending spectacle, made use of the vilest taunts, and exulted in what he had done. The dutiful child, as if recovering strength at the sight of his father, on his knees implored his blessing. "Alas! Will," said the afflicted parent, in trembling amazement, "who hath done this to thee!" the artless innocent related the circumstances that led to the merciless correction which had been so basely inflicted on him; but when he repeated the reproof bestowed on the chaplain, and which was prompted by an undaunted spirit, he was torn from his weeping parent, and conveyed again to the house, where he remained a close prisoner.  Bonner, somewhat fearful that what had been done could not be justified even among the bloodhounds of his own voracious pack, concluded in his dark and wicked mind, to release John Fetty, for a time at least, from the severities he was enduring in the glorious cause of everlasting truth! whose bright rewards are fixed beyond the boundaries of time, within the confines of eternity; where the arrow of the wicked cannot wound, even "where there shall be no more sorrowing for the blessed, who, in the mansion of eternal bliss shall glorify the Lamb forever and ever." He was accordingly by order of Bonner, (how disgraceful to all dignity, to say bishop!) liberated from the painful bonds, and led from Lollard's Tower, to the chamber of that ungodly and infamous butcher, where he found the bishop bathing himself before a great fire; and at his first entering the chamber, Fetty said, "God be here and peace!" "God be here and peace, (said Bonner,) that is neither God speed nor good morrow!" "If ye kick against this peace, (said Fetty), then this is not the place that I seek for."  A chaplain of the bishop, standing by, turned the poor man about, and thinking to abash him, said, in mocking wise, "What have we here-a player!" While Fetty was thus standing in the bishop's chamber, he espied, hanging about the bishop's bed, a pair of great black beads, whereupon he said, "My Lord, I think the hangman is not far off: for the halter (pointing to the beads) is here already!" At which words the bishop was in a marvellous rage. Then he immediately after espied also, standing in the bishop's chamber, in the window, a little crucifix. Then he asked the bishop what it was, and he answered, that it was Christ. "Was He handled as cruelly as He is here pictured!" said Fetty. "Yea, that He was," said the bishop. "And even so cruelly will you handle such as come before you; for you are unto God's people as Caiaphas was unto Christ!" The bishop, being in a great fury, said, "Thou art a vile heretic, and I will burn thee, or else I will spend all I have, unto my gown." "Nay, my Lord, (said Fetty) you were better to give it to some poor body, that he may pray for you." Bonner, notwithstanding his passion, which was raised to the utmost by the calm and pointed remarks of this observing Christian, thought it most prudent to dismiss the father, on account of the nearly murdered child. His coward soul trembled for the consequences which might ensue; fear is inseparable from little minds; and this dastardly pampered priest experienced its effects so far as to induce him to assume the appearance of that he was an utter stranger to, namely, MERCY.  The father, on being dismissed, by the tyrant Bonner, went home with a heavy heart, with his dying child, who did not survive many days the cruelties which had been inflicted on him.  How contrary to the will of our great King and Prophet, who mildly taught His followers, was the conduct of this sanguinary and false teacher, this vile apostate from his God to Satan! But the archfiend had taken entire possession of his heart, and guided every action of the sinner he had hardened; who, given up to terrible destruction, was running the race of the wicked, marking his footsteps with the blood of the saints, as if eager to arrive at the goal of eternal death.Deliverance of Dr. SandsThis eminent prelate, vice-chancellor of Cambridge, at the request of the duke of Northumberland, when he came down to Cambridge in support of Lady Jane Grey's claim to the throne, undertook at a few hours' notice, to preach before the duke and the university. The text he took was such as presented itself in opening the Bible, and a more appropriate one he could not have chosen, namely, the three last verses of Joshua. As God gave him the text, so He gave him also such order and utterance that it excited the most lively emotions in his numerous auditors. The sermon was about to be sent to London to be printed, when news arrived that the duke had returned and Queen Mary was proclaimed.  The duke was immediately arrested, and Dr. Sands was compelled by the university to give up his office. He was arrested by the queen's order, and when Mr. Mildmay wondered that so learned a man could wilfully incur danger, and speak against so good a princess as Mary, the doctor replied, "If I would do as Mr. Mildmay has done, I need not fear bonds. He came down armed against Queen Mary; before a trator-now a great friend. I cannot with one mouth blow hot and cold in this manner." A general plunder of Dr. Sands' property ensued, and he was brought to London upon a wretched horse. Various insults he met on the way from the bigoted Catholics, and as he passed through Bishopsgate-street, a stone struck him to the ground. He was the first prisoner that entered the Tower, in that day, on a religious account; his man was admitted with his Bible, but his shirts and other articles were taken from him.  On Mary's coronation day the doors of the dungeon were so laxly guarded that it was easy to escape. A Mr. Mitchell, like a true friend, came to him, afforded him his own clothes as a disguise, and was willing to abide the consequence of being found in his place. This was a rare friendship: but he refused the offer; saying, "I know no cause why I should be in prison. To do thus were to make myself guilty. I will expect God's good will, yet do I think myself much obliged to you"; and so Mr. Mitchell departed.  With Doctor Sands was imprisoned Mr. Bradford; they were kept close in prison twenty-nine weeks. John Fowler, their keeper, was a perverse papist, yet, by often persuading him, at length he began to favor the Gospel, and was so persuaded in the true religion, that on a Sunday, when they had Mass in the chapel, Dr. Sands administered the Communion to Bradford and to Fowler. Thus Fowler was their son begotten in bonds. To make room for Wyat and his accomplices, Dr. Sands and nine other preachers were sent to the Marshalsea.  The keeper of the Marshalsea appointed to every preacher a man to lead him in the street; he caused them to go on before, and he and Dr. Sands followed conversing together. By this time popery began to be unsavory. After they had passed the bridge, the keeper said to Dr. Sands: "I perceive the vain people would set you forward to the fire. You are as vain as they, if you, being a young man, will stand in your own conceit, and prefer your own judgment before that of so many worthy prelates, ancient, learned, and grave men as be in this realm. If you do so, you shall find me a severe keeper, and one that utterly dislikes your religion." Dr. Sands answered, "I know my years to be young, and my learning but small; it is enough to know Christ crucified, and he hath learned nothing who seeth not the great blasphemy that is in popery. I will yield unto God, and not unto man; I have read in the Scriptures of many godly and couretous keepers: may God make you one! if not, I trust He will give me strength and patience to bear your hard usage." Then said the keeper, "Are you resolved to stand to your religion?" "Yes," quoth the doctor, "by God's grace!" "Truly," said the keeper, "I love you the better for it; I did but tempt you: what favor I can show you, you shall be assured of; and I shall think myself happy if I might die at the stake with you."  He was as good as his word, for he trusted the doctor to walk in the fields alone, where he met with Mr. Bradford, who was also a prisoner in the King's Bench, and had found the same favor from his keeper. At his request, he put Mr. Saunders in along with him, to be his bedfellow, and the Communion was administered to a great number of communicants.  When Wyat with his army came to Southwark, he offered to liberate all the imprisoned Protestants, but Dr. Sands and the rest of the preachers refused to accept freedom on such terms.  After Dr. Sands had been nine weeks prisoner in the Marshalsea, by the mediation of Sir Thomas Holcroft, knight marshal, he was set at liberty. Though Mr. Holcroft had the queen's warrant, the bishop commanded him not to set Dr. Sands at liberty, until he had taken sureties of two gentlemen with him, each one bound in �500, that Dr. Sands should not depart out of the realm without license. Mr. Holcroft immediately after met with two gentlemen of the north, friends and cousins to Dr. Sands, who offered to be bound for him.  After dinner, the same day, Sir Thomas Holcroft sent for Dr.  Sands to his lodgings at Westminster, to communicate to him all he had done. Dr. Sands answered: "I give God thanks, who hath moved your heart to mind me so well, that I think myself most bound unto you. God shall requite you, nor shall I ever be found unthankful. But as you have dealt friendly with me, I will also deal plainly with you. I came a freeman into prison; I will not go forth a bondman. As I cannot benefit my friends, so will I not hurt them. And if I be set at liberty, I will not tarry six days in this realm, if I may get out. If therefore I may not get free forth, send me to the Marshalsea again, and there you shall be sure of me."  This answer Mr. Holcroft much disapproved of; but like a true friend he replied: "Seeing you cannot be altered, I will change my purpose, and yield unto you. Come of it what will, I will set you at liberty; and seeing you have a mind to go over sea, get you gone as quick as you can. One thing I require of you, that, while you are there, you write nothing to me hither, for this may undo me."  Dr. Sands having taken an affectionate farewell of him and his other friends in bonds, departed. He went by Winchester house, and there took boat, and came to a friend's house in London, called William Banks, and tarried there one night. The next night he went to another friend's house, and there he heard that strict search was making for him, by Gardiner's express order.  Dr. Sands now conveyed himself by night to one Mr. Berty's house, a stranger who was in the Marshalsea prison with him a while; he was a good Protestant and dwelt in Mark-lane. There he was six days, and then removed to one of his acquaintances in Cornhill; he caused his man Quinton to provide two geldings for him, resolved on the morrow to ride into Essex, to Mr. Sands, his father-in-law, where his wife was, which, after a narrow escape, he effected. He had not been theretwo hours, before Mr. Sands was told that two of the guards would that night apprehend Dr. Sands.  That night Dr. Sands was guided to an honest farmer's near the sea, where he tarried two days and two nights in a chamber without company. After that he removed to one James Mower's, a shipmaster, who dwelt at Milton-Shore, where he waited for a wind to Flanders. While he was there, James Mower brought to him forty or fifty mariners, to whom he gave an exhortation; they liked him so well that they promised to die rather than he should be apprehended.  The sixth of May, Sunday, the wind served. In taking leave of his hostess, who had been married eight years without having a child, he gave her a fine handkerchief and an old royal of gold, and said, "Be of good comfort; before that one whole year be past, God shall give you a child, a boy." This came to pass, for, that day twelve-month, wanting one day, God gave her a son.  Scarcely had he arrived at Antwerp, when he learned that King Philip had sent to apprehend him. He next flew to Augsburg, in Cleveland, where Dr. Sands tarried fourteen days, and then travelled towards Strassburg, where, after he had lived one year, his wife came to him. He was sick of a flux nine months, and had a child which died of the plague. His amiable wife at length fell into a consumption, and died in his arms. When his wife was dead, he went to Zurich, and there was in Peter Martyr's house for the space of five weeks.  As they sat at dinner one day, word was suddenly brought that Queen Mary was dead, and Dr. Sands was sent for by his friends at Strassburg, where he preached. Mr. Grindal and he came over to England, and arrived in London the same day that Queen Elizabeth was crowned. This faithful servant of Christ, under Queen Elizabeth, rose to the highest distinction in the Church, being successively bishop of Worcester, bishop of London, and archbishop of York.Queen Mary's Treatment of Her Sister, the Princess ElizabethThe preservation of Princess Elizabeth may be reckoned a remarkable instance of the watchful eye which Christ had over His Church. The bigotry of Mary regarded not the ties of consanguinity, of natural affection, of national succession. Her mind, physically morose, was under the dominion of men who possessed not the milk of human kindness, and whose principles werre sanctioned and enjoined by the idolatrous tenets of the Romish pontiff. Could they have foreseen the short date of Mary's reign, they would have imbrued their hands in the Protestant blood of Elizabeth, and, as a sine qua non of the queen's salvation, have compelled her to bequeath the kingdom to some Catholic prince. The contest might have been attended with the horrors incidental to a religious civil war, and calamities might have been felt in England similar to those under Henry the Great in France, whom Queen Elizabeth assisted in opposing his priest-ridden Catholic subjects. As if Providence had the perpetual establishment of the Protestant faith in view, the difference of the duration of the two reigns is worthy of notice. Mary might have reigned many years in the course of nature, but the course of grace willed it otherwise. Five years and four months was the time of persecution alloted to this weak, disgraceful reign, while that of Elizabeth reckoned a number of years among the highest of those who have sat on the English throne, almost nine times that of her merciless sister!  Before Mary attained the crown, she treated Elizabeth with a sisterly kindness, but from that period her conduct was altered, and the most imperious distance substituted. Though Elizabeth had no concern in the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyat, yet she was apprehended, and treated as a culprit in that commotion. The manner too of her arrest was similar to the mind that dictated it: the three cabinet members, whom she deputed to see the arrest executed, rudely entered the chamber at ten o'clock at night, and, though she was extremely ill, they could scarcely be induced to let her remain until the following morning. Her enfeebled state permitted her to be moved only by short stages in a journey of such length to London; but the princess, though afflicted in person, had a consolation in mind which her sister never could purchase: the people, through whom she passed on her way pitied her, and put up their prayers for her preservation.  Arrived at court, she was made a close prisoner for a fortnight, without knowing who was her accuser, or seeing anyone who could console or advise her. The charge, however, was at length unmasked by Gardiner, who, with nineteen of the Council, accused her of abetting Wyat's conspiracy, which she religiously affirmed to be false. Failing in this, they placed against her the transactions of Sir Peter Carew in the west, in which they were as unsuccessful as in the former. The queen now signified that it was her pleasure she should be committed to the Tower, a step which overwhelmed the princess with the greatest alarm and uneasiness. In vain she hoped the queen's majesty would not commit her to such a place; but there was no lenity to be expected; her attendants were limited, and a hundred northern soldiers appointed to guard her day and night.  On Palm Sunday she was conducted to the Tower. When she came to the palace garden, she cast her eyes towards the windows, eagerly anxious to meet those of the queen, but she was disappointed. A strict order was given in London that every one should go to church, and carry palms, that she might be conveyed without clamor or commiseration to her prison.  At the time of passing under London Bridge the fall of the tide made it very dangerous, and the barge some time stuck fast against the starlings. To mortify her the more, she was landed at Traitors' Stairs. As it rained fast, and she was obliged to step in the water to land, she hesitated; but this excited no complaisance in the lord in waiting. When she set her foot on the steps, she exclaimed, "Here lands as true a subject, being prisoner, as ever landed at these stairs; and before Thee, O God, I speak it, having no friend but Thee alone!"  A large number of the wardens and servants of the Tower were arranged in order between whom the princess had to pass. Upon inquiring the use of this parade, she was informed it was customary to do so. "If," said she, "it is on account of me, I beseech you that they may be dismissed." On this the poor men knelt down, and prayed that God would preserve her grace, for which they were the next day turned out of their employments. The tragic scene must have been deeply interesting, to see an amiable and irreproachable princess sent like a lamb to languish in expectation of cruelty and death; against whom there was no other charge than her superiority in Christian virtues and acquired endowments. Her attendants openly wept as she proceeded with a dignified step to the frowning battlements of her destination. "Alas!" said Elizabeth, "what do you mean? I took you to comfort, not to dismay me; for my truth is such that no one shall have cause to weep for me."  The next step of her enemies was to procure evidence by means which, in the present day, are accounted detestable. Many poor prisoners were racked, to extract, if possible, any matters of accusation which might affect her life, and thereby gratify Gardiner's sanguinary disposition. He himself came to examine her, respecting her removal from her house at Ashbridge to Dunnington castle a long while before. The princess had quite forgotten this trivial circumstance, and Lord Arundel, after the investigation, kneeling down, apologized for having troubled her in such a frivolous matter. "You sift me narrowly," replied the princess, "but of this I am assured, that God has appointed a limit to your proceedings; and so God forgive you all."  Her own gentlemen, who ought to have been her purveyors, and served her provision, were compelled to give place to the common soldiers, at the command of the constable of the Tower, who was in every respect a servile tool of Gardiner; her grace's friends, however, procured an order of Council which regulated this petty tyranny more to her satisfaction.  After having been a whole month in close confinement, she sent for the lord chamberlain and Lord Chandois, to whom she represented the ill state of her health from a want of proper air and exercise. Application being made to the Council, Elizabeth was with some difficulty admitted to walk in the queen's lodgings, and afterwards in the garden, at which time the prisoners on that side were attended by their keepers, and not suffered to look down upon her. Their jealousy was excited by a child of four years, who daily brought flowers to the princess. The child was threatened with a whipping, and the father ordered to keep him from the princess's chambers.  On the fifth of May the constable was discharged from his office, and Sir Henry Benifield appointed in his room, accompanied by a hundred ruffian-looking soldiers in blue. This measure created considerable alarm in the mind of the princess, who imagined it was preparatory to her undergoing the same fate as Lady Jane Grey, upon the same block. Assured that this project was not in agitation, she entertained an idea that the new keeper of the Tower was commissioned to make away with her privately, as his equivocal character was in conformity with the ferocious inclination of those by whom he was appointed.  A report now obtained that her Grace was to be taken away by the new constable and his soldiers, which in the sequel proved to be true. An order of Council was made for her removal to the manor Woodstock, which took place on Trinity Sunday, May 13, under the authority of Sir Henry Benifield and Lord Tame. The ostensible cause of her removal was to make room for other prisoners. Richmond was the first place they stopped at, and here the princess slept, not however without much alarm at first, as her own servants were superseded by the soldiers, who were placed as guards at her chamber door. Upon representation, Lord Tame overruled this indecent stretch of power, and granted her perfect safety while under his custody.  In passing through Windsor, she saw several of her poor dejected servants waiting to see her. "Go to them," said she, to one of her attendants, "and say these words from me, tanquim ovis, that is, like a sheep to the slaughter."  The next night her Grace lodged at the house of a Mr. Dormer, in her way to which the people manifested such tokens of loyal affection that Sir Henry was indignant, and bestowed on them very liberally the names of rebels and traitors. In some villages they rang the bells for joy, imagining the princess's arrival among them was from a very different cause; but this harmless demonstration of gladness was sufficient with the persecuting Benifield to order his soldiers to seize and set these humble persons in the stocks.  The day following, her Grace arrived at Lord Tame's house, where she stayed all night, and was most nobly entertained. This excited Sir Henry's indignation, and made him caution Lord Tame to look well to his proceedings; but the humanity of Lord Tame was not to be frightened, and he returned a suitable reply. At another time, this official prodigal, to show his consequence and disregard of good manners, went up into a chamber, where was appointed for her Grace a chair, two cushions, and a foot carpet, wherein he presumptuously sat and called his man to pull off his boots. As soon as it was known to the ladies and gentlemen they laughed him to scorn. When supper was done, he called to his lordship, and directed that all gentlemen and ladies should withdraw home, marvelling much that he would permit such a large company, considering the great charge he had committed to him. "Sir Henry," said his lordship, "content yourself; all shall be avoided, your men and all." "Nay, but my soldiers," replied Sir Henry, "shall watch all night." Lord Tame answered, "There is no need." "Well," said he, "need or need not, they shall so do."  The next day her Grace took her journey from thence to Woodstock, where she was enclosed, as before in the Tower of London, the soldiers keeping guard within and without the walls, every day, to the number of sixty; and in the night, without the walls were forty during all the time of her imprisonment.  At length she was permitted to walk in the gardens, but under the most severe restrictions, Sir Henry keeping the keys himself, and placing her always under many bolts and locks, whence she was induced to call him her jailer, at which he felt offended, and begged her to substitute the word officer. After much earnest entreaty to the Council, she obtained permission to write to the queen; but the jailer who brought her pen, ink, and paper stood by her while she wrote, and, when she left off, he carried the things away until they were wanted again. He also insisted upon carrying it himself to the queen, but Elizabeth would not suffer him to be the bearer, and it was presented by one of her gentlemen.  After the letter, Doctors Owen and Wendy went to the princess, as the state of her health rendered medical assistance necessary. They stayed with her five or six days, in which time she grew much better; they then returned to the queen, and spoke flatteringly of the princess' submission and humility, at which the queen seemed moved; but the bishops wanted a concession that she had offended her majesty. Elizabeth spurned this indirect mode of acknowledging herself guilty. "If I have offended," said she, "and am guilty, I crave no mercy but the law, which I am certain I should have had ere this, if anything could have been proved against me. I wish I were as clear from the peril of my enemies; then should I not be thus bolted and locked up within walls and doors."  Much question arose at this time respecting the propriety of uniting the princess to some foreigner, that she might quit the realm with a suitable portion. One of the Council had the brutality to urge the necessity of beheading her, if the king (Philip) meant to keep the realm in peace; but the Spaniards, detesting such a base thought, replied, "God forbid that oiur king and master should consent to such an infamous proceeding!" Stimulated by a noble principle, the Spaniards from this time repeatedly urged to the king that it would do him the highest honor to liberate the Lady Elizabeth, nor was the king impervious to their solicitation. He took her out of prison, and shortly after she was sent for to Hampton court. It may be remarked in this place, that the fallacy of human reasoning is shown in every moment. The barbarian who suggested the policy of beheading Elizabeth little contemplated the change of condition which his speech would bring about. In her journey from Woodstock, Benifield treated her with the same severity as before; removing her on a stormy day, and not suffering her old servant, who had come to Colnbrook, where she slept, to speak to her.  She remained a fortnight strictly guarded and watched, before anyone dared to speak with her; at length the vile Gardiner with three more of the Council, came with great submission. Elizabeth saluted them, remarked that she had been for a long time kept in solitary confinement, and begged they would intercede with the king and queen to deliver her from prison. Gardiner's visit was to draw from the princess a confession of her guilt; but she was guarded against his subtlety, adding, that, rather than admit she had done wrong, she would lie in prison all the rest of her life. The next day Gardiner came again, and kneeling down, declared that the queen was astonished she would persist in affirming that she was blameless-whence it would be inferred that the queen had unjustly imprisoned her grace. Gardiner further informed her that the queen had declared that she must tell another tale, before she could be set at liberty. "Then," replied the high-minded Elizabeth, "I had rather be in prison with honesty and truth, than have my liberty, and be suspected by her majesty. What I have said, I will stand to; nor will I ever speak falsehood!" The bishop and his friends then departed, leaving her locked up as before.  Seven days after the queen sent for Elizabeth at ten o'clock at night; two years had elapsed since they had seen each other. It created terror in the mind of the princess, who, at setting out, desired her gentlemen and ladies to pray for her, as her return to them again was uncertain.  Being conducted to the queen's bedchamber, upon entering it the princess knelt down, and having begged of God to preserve her majesty, she humbly assured her that her majesty had not a more loyal subject in the realm, whatever reports might be circulated to the contrary. With a haughty ungraciousness, the imperious queen replied: "You will not confess your offence, but stand stoutly to your truth. I pray God it may so fall out."  "If it do not," said Elizabeth, "I request neither favor nor pardon at your majesty's hands." "Well," said the queen, "you stiffly still persevere in your truth. Besides, you will not confess that you have not been wrongfully punished."  "I must not say so, if it please your majesty, to you."  "Why, then," said the queen, "belike you will to others."  "No, if it please your majesty: I have borne the burden, and must bear it. I humbly beseech your majesty to have a good opinion of me and to think me to be your subject, not only from the beginning hitherto, but for ever, as long as life lasteth." They departed without any heartfelt satisfaction on either side; nor can we think the conduct of Elizabeth displayed that independence and fortitude which accompanies perfect innocence. Elizabeth's admitting that she would not say, neither to the queen nor to others, that she had been unjustly punished, was in direct contradiction to what she had told Gardiner, and must have arisen from some motive at this time inexplicable. King Philip is supposed to have been secretly concealed during the interview, and to have been friendly to the princess.  In seven days from the time of her return to imprisonment, her severe jailer and his men were discharged, and she was set at liberty, under the constraint of being always attended and watched by some of the queen's Council. Four of her gentlemen were sent to the Tower without any other charge against them than being zealous servants of their mistress. This event was soon after followed by the happy news of Gardiner's death, for which all good and merciful men glorified God, inasmuch as it had taken the chief tiger from the den, and rendered the life of the Protestant successor of Mary more secure.  This miscreant, while the princess was in the Tower, sent a secret writ, signed by a few of the Council, for her private execution, and, had Mr. Bridges, lieutenant of the Tower, been as little scrupulous of dark assassination as this pious prelate was, she must have perished. The warrant not having the queen's signature, Mr. Bridges hastened to her majesty to give her information of it, and to know her mind. This was a plot of Winchester's, who, to convict her of treasonable practices, caused several prisoners to be racked; particularly Mr. Edmund Tremaine and Smithwicke were offered considerable bribes to accuse the guiltless princess.  Her life was several times in danger. While at Woodstock, fire was apparently put between the boards and ceiling under which she lay. It was also reported strongly that one Paul Penny, the keeper of Woodstock, a notorious ruffian, was appointed to assassinate her, but, however this might be, God counteracted in this point the nefarious designs of the enemies of the Reformation. James Basset was another appointed to perform the same deed: he was a peculiar favorite of Gardiner, and had come within a mile of Woodstock, intending to speak with Benifield on the subject. The goodness of God however so ordered it that while Basset was travelling to Woodstock, Benifield, by an order of Council, was going to London: in consequence of which, he left a positive order with his brother, that no man should be admitted to the princess during his absence, not even with a note from the queen; his brother met the murderer, but the latter's intention was frustrated, as no admission could be obtained.  When Elizabeth quitted Woodstock, she left the following lines written with her diamond on the window:  Much suspected by me, Nothing proved can be. Quoth Elizabeth, prisoner.  With the life of Winchester ceased the extreme danger of the princess, as many of her other secret enemies soon after followed him, and, last of all, her cruel sister, who outlived Gardiner but three years.  The death of Mary was ascribed to several causes. The Council endeavored to console her in her last moments, imagining it was the absence of her husband that lay heavy at her heart, but though his treatment had some weight, the loss of Calais, the last fortress possessed by the English in France, was the true source of her sorrow. "Open my heart," said Mary, "when I am dead, and you shall find Calais written there." Religion caused her no alarm; the priests had lulled to rest every misgiving of conscience, which might have obtruded, on account of the accusing spirits of the murdered martyrs. Not the blood she had spilled, but the loss of a town excited her emotions in dying, and this last stroke seemed to be awarded, that her fanatical persecution might be paralleled by her political imbecility.  We earnestly pray that the annals of no country, Catholic or pagan, may ever be stained with such a repetition of human sacrifices to papal power, and that the detestation in which the character of Mary is holden, may be a beacon to succeeding monarchs to avoid the rocks of fanaticism!God's Punishment upon Some of the Persecutors of His People in Mary's ReignAfter that arch-persecutor, Gardiner, was dead, others followed, of whom Dr. Morgan, bishop of St. David's, who succeeded Bishop Farrar, is to be noticed. Not long after he was installed in his bishoipric, he was stricken by the visitation of God; his food passed through the throat, but rose again with great violence. In this manner, almost literally starved to death, he terminated his existence.  Bishop Thornton, suffragan of Dover, was an indefatigable persecutor of the true Church. One day after he had exercised his cruel tyranny upon a number of pious persons at Canterbury, he came from the chapter-house to Borne, where as he stood on a Sunday looking at his men playing at bowls, he fell down in a fit of the palsy, and did not long survive.  After the latter, succeeded another bishop or suffragen, ordained by Gardiner, who not long after he had been raised to the see of Dover, fell down a pair of stairs in the cardinal's chamber at Greenwich, and broke his neck. He had just received the cardinal's blessing-he could receive nothing worse.  John Cooper, of Watsam, Suffolk, suffered by perjury; he was from private pique persecuted by one Fenning, who suborned two others to swear that they heard Cooper say, 'If God did not take away Queen Mary, the devil would.' Cooper denied all such words, but Cooper was a Proestant and a heretic, and therefore he was hung, drawn and quartered, his property confiscated, and his wife and nine children reduced to beggary. The following harvest, however, Grimwood of Hitcham, one of the witnesses before mentioned, was visited for his villainy: while at work, stacking up corn, his bowels suddenly burst out, and before relief could be obtained, her died. Thus was deliberate perjury rewarded by sudden death!  In the case of the martyr Mr. Bradford, the severity of Mr.  Sheriff Woodroffe has been noticed-he rejoiced at the death of the saints, and at Mr. Rogers' execution, he broke the carman's head, because he stopped the cart to let the martyr's children take a last farewell of him. Scarcely had Mr. Woodroffe's sheriffalty expired a week, when he was struck with a paralytic affection, and languished a few days in the most pitable and helpless condition, presenting a striking contrast to his former activity in the cause of blood.  Ralph Lardyn, who betrayed the martyr George Eagles, is believed to have been afterward arraigned and hanged in consequence of accusing himself. At the bar, he denounced himself in these words: "This has most justly fallen upon me, for betraying the innocent blood of that just and good man George Eagles, who was here condemned in the time of Queen Mary by my procurement, when I sold his blood for a little money."  As James Abbes was going to execution, and exhorting the pitying bystanders to adhere steadfastly to the truth, and like him to seal the cause of Christ with their blood, a servant of the sheriff's interrupted him, and blasphemously called his religion heresy, and the good man a lunatic. Scarcely however had the flames reached the martyr, before the fearful stroke of God fell upn the hardened wretch, in the presence of him he had so cruelly ridiculed. The man was suddenly seized with lunacy, cast off his clothes and shoes before the people, (as Abbes had done just before, to distribute among some poor persons,) at the same time exclaiming, "Thus did James Abbes, the true servant of God, who is saved by I am damned." Repeating this often, the sheriff had him secured, and made him put his clothes on, but no sooner was he alone, than he tore them off, and exclaimed as before. Being tied in a cart, he was conveyed to his master's house, and in about half a year he died; just before which a priest came to attend him, with the crucifix, etc., but the wretched man bade him take away such trumpery, and said that he and other priests had been the cause of his damnation, but that Abbes was saved.  One Clark, an avowed enemy of the Protestants in King Edward's reign, hung himself in the Tower of London.  Froling, a priest of much celebrity, fell down in the street and died on the spot.  Dale, an indefatigable informer, was consumed by vermin, and died a miserable spectacle.  Alexander, the severe keeper of Newgate, died miserably, swelling to a prodigious size, and became so inwardly putrid, that none could come near him. This cruel minister of the law would go to Bonner, Story, and others, requesting them to rid his prison, he was so much pestered with heretics! The son of this keeper, in three years after his father's death, dissipated his great property, and died suddenly in Newgate market. "The sins of the father," says the decalogue, "shall be visited on the children." John Peter, son-in-law of Alexander, a horrid blasphemer and persecutor, died wretchedly. When he affirmed anything, he would say, "If it be not true, I pray I may rot ere I die." This awful state visited him in all its loathsomeness.  Sir Ralph Ellerker was eagerly desirous to see the heart taken out of Adam Damlip, who was wrongfully put to death. Shortly after Sir Ralph was slain by the French, who mangled him dreadfully, cut off his limbs, and tore his heart out.  When Gardiner heard of the miserable end of Judge Hales, he called the profession of the Gospel a doctrine of desperation; but he forgot that the judge's despondency arose after he had consented to the papistry. But with more reason may this be said of the Catholic tenets, if we consider the miserable end of Dr. Pendleton, Gardiner, and most of the leading persecutors. Gardiner, upon his death bed, was reminded by a bishop of Peter denying his master, "Ah," said Gardiner, "I have denied with Peter, but never repented with Peter."  After the accession of Elizabeth, most of the Catholic prelates were imprisoned in the Tower or the Fleet; Bonner was put into the Marshalsea.  Of the revilers of God's Word, we detail, among many others, the following occurrence. One William Maldon, living at Greenwich in servitude, was instructing himself profitably in reading an English primer one winter's evening. A serving man, named John Powell, sat by, and ridiculed all that Maldon said, who cautioned him not to make a jest of the Word of God. Powell nevertheless continued, until Maldon came to certain English Prayers, and read aloud, "Lord, have mercy upon us, Christ have mercy upon us," etc. Suddenly the reviler started, and exclaimed, "Lord, have mercy upon us!" He was struck with the utmost terror of mind, said the evil spirit could not abide that Christ should have any mercy upon him, and sunk into madness. He was remitted to Bedlam, and became an awful warning that God will not always be insulted with impunity.  Henry Smith, a student in the law, had a pious Protesant father, of Camben, in Gloucestershire, by whom he was virtuously educated. While studying law in the middle temple, he was induced to profess Catholicism, and, going to Louvain, in France, he returned with pardons, crucifixes, and a great freight of popish toys. Not content with these things, he openly reviled the Gospel religion he had been brought up in; but conscience one night reproached him so dreadfully, that in a fit of despair he hung himself in his garters. He was buried in a lane, without the Christian service being read over him.  Dr. Story, whose name has been so often mtnioned in the preceding pages, was reserved to be cut off by public execution, a practice in which he had taken great delight when in power. He is supposed to have had a hand in most of the conflagrations in Mary's time, and was even ingenious in his invention of new modes of inflicting torture. When Elizabeth came to the throne, he was committed to prison, but unaccountably effected his escape to the continent, to carry fire and sword there among the Protestant brethren. From the duke of Alva, at Antwerp, he received a special commission to search all ships for contraband goods, and particularly for English heretical books.  Dr. Story gloried in a commission that was ordered by Providence to be his ruin, and to preserve the faithful from his sanguinary cruelty. It was contrived that one Parker, a merchant, should sail to Antwerp and information should be given to Dr. Story that he had a quantity of heretical books on board. The latter no sooner heard this, than he hastened to the vessel, sought everywhere above, and then went under the hatches, which were fastened down upon him. A prosperous gale brought the ship to England, and this traitorous, persecuting rebel was committed to prison, where he remained a considerable time, obstinately objecting to recant his Anti-christian spirit, or admit of Queen Elizabeth's supremacy. He alleged, though by birth and education an Englishman, that he was a sworn subject of the king of Spain, in whose service the famous duke of Alva was. The doctor being condemned, was laid upon a hurdle, and drawn from the Tower to Tyburn, where after being suspended about half an hour, he was cut down, stripped, and the executioner displayed the heart of a traitor.  Thus ended the existence of this Nimrod of England.Embed;

I'll Remember (Theme from the Motion Picture With Honors);Madonna;pop; It is to the 30+ testosteronically afflicted males whose cases have been documented in the past two years that your correspondents wish to dedicate this article. And to those tormented souls considering autocastration in 1998, we wish to say: �Stop! Stay your hand! Hold off with those kitchen utensils and/or wire cutters!� Because we believe we may have found an alternative.  Every spring, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents awards for outstanding achievement in all aspects of mainstream cinema. These are the Academy Awards. Mainstream cinema is a major industry in the United States, and so are the Academy Awards. The AAs� notorious commercialism and hypocrisy disgust many of the millions and millions and millions of viewers who tune in during prime time to watch the presentations. It is not a coincidence that the Oscars ceremony is held during TV�s Sweeps Week. We pretty much all tune in, despite the grotesquerie of watching an industry congratulate itself on its pretense that it�s still an art form, of hearing people in $5,000 gowns invoke lush clich�s of surprise and humility scripted by publicists, etc.�the whole cynical postmodern deal�but we all still seem to watch. To care. Even though the hypocrisy hurts, even though opening grosses and marketing strategies are now bigger news than the movies themselves, even though Cannes and Sundance have become nothing more than enterprise zones. But the truth is that there�s no more real joy about it all anymore. Worse, there seems to be this enormous unspoken conspiracy where we all pretend that there�s still joy. That we think it�s funny when Bob Dole does a Visa ad and Gorbachev shills for Pizza Hut. That the whole mainstream celebrity culture is rushing to cash in and all the while congratulating itself on pretending not to cash in. Underneath it all, though, we know the whole thing sucks.  Your correspondents humbly offer an alternative.  Every January, the least pretentious city in America hosts the Annual AVN Awards. The AVN stands for Adult Video News, which is sort of the Variety of the US porn industry. This thick, beautifully designed magazine costs $7.95 per issue, is about 80 percent ads, and is clearly targeted at adult-video retailers. Its circulation is appr. 40,000.  Though the sub-line vagaries of entertainment accounting are legendary, it is universally acknowledged that the US adult-film industry, at $3.5-4 billion in annual sales, rentals, cable charges, and video-masturbation-booth revenues, is an even larger and more efficient moneymaking machine than legitimate mainstream American cinema (the latter�s annual gross commonly estimated at $2-2.5 billion). The US adult industry is centered in LA�s San Fernando Valley, just over the mountains from Hollywood.1 Some insiders like to refer to the adult industry as Hollywood�s Evil Twin, others as the mainstream�s Big Red Son.  It is no accident that Adult Video News�a slick, expensive periodical whose articles are really more like infomercials�and its yearly Awards both came into being in 1982. The early �80s, after all, saw the genesis of VCRs and home-video rentals, which have done for the adult industry pretty much what TV did for pro football.  From the 12/11/97 press release issued by AVN (visitable also at www.avn.com):  - The nominations for the 15th Annual AVN Awards were announced today.2 This year�s awards show, commemorating AVN�s 15th anniversary, celebrates �History�. [sic]  - Awards will be presented in a record 106 categories over a two night period.  - The adult industry released nearly 8,000 adult releases [sic] in 1997, including over 4,000 �new� releases (non-compilation). AVN reviewed every new release in every categroy [sic] this past year, logging over 30,000 sex scenes.3  - By comparison, last year there were approximately 375 films eligible for the Academy Awards that these voters [sic�meaning different voters from the AVN voters, presumably] were required to see. AVN had to watch more than 10 times the amount of releases in order to develop these nominations [usage and repetition sic, though 4,000 divided by 375 is indeed over 10].  From the acceptance speech of Mr. Tom Byron, Saturday, 10 January 1998, Caesars Forum ballroom, Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino complex, Las Vegas NV, upon winning AVN�s 1998 Male Performer of the Year Award (and with no little feeling): �I want to thank every beautiful woman I ever put my cock inside.� [Laughter, cheers, ovation.] From the acceptance speech of Ms. Jeanna Fine, ibid., upon winning AVN�s 1998 Best Supporting Actress Award for her role in Rob Black�s Miscreants: �Jesus, which one is this for, Miscreants? Jesus, that�s another one where I read the script and said �Oh shit, I am going to go to hell. [Laughter, cheers.] But that�s okay, �cause all my friends�ll be there too!� [Huge wave of laughter, cheers, applause.]  From the inter-Award banter of Mr. Bobby Slayton, professional comedian and master of ceremonies for the 1997 AVNAs: �I know I�m looking good, though, like younger, �cause I started using this special Grecian Formula�every time I find a gray hair, I fuck my wife in the ass. [No laughter, scattered groans.] Fuck you. That�s a great joke. Fuck you.�  Bobby Slayton, a gravelly-voiced Dice Clay knockoff who kept introducing every female performer as �the woman I�m going to cut my dick off for,� and who astounded all the marginal print journalists in attendance with both his unfunniness and his resemblance to every apartment-complex coke dealer we�d ever met, is mercifully absent from the 1998 Awards gala. The �98 emcee is one Robert Schimmel, alumnus of In Living Color and a Howard Stern regular. Schimmel looks like a depraved, deeply tan Wallace Shawn and is no less coarse than B. Slayton but a lot better. He does a pantomime of someone attempting intercourse with a Love Doll he�s been too lazy to blow up all the way. He contrasts the woeful paucity of his own ejaculate with the concussive orgasms of certain well-known male performers,4 comparing these men�s ejaculations to automatic lawn sprinklers and doing an eerie sonic impression of same. All of 1998�s marginal print journalists are together at Table 189 at the very back of the ballroom. Most of these reporters are from the sorts of men�s magazines that sit shrinkwrapped behind the cash registers of convenience stores, and they are a worldly and jaded crew indeed, but Schimmel gets a couple of them�whose noms de guerre are Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth�laughing so uproariously that people at the Anabolic Video table nearby keep looking over in annoyance. At one point during a routine on premature ejaculation, Dick Filth actually chokes on a California roll.  � But all this is Saturday night, the main event. And there are a whole lot of festivities preceding Saturday�s climax.  The adult industry is vulgar. Would anyone disagree? One of the AVN Awards� categories is �Best Anal Themed Feature�; another is �Best Overall Marketing Campaign�Company Image.� Irresistible, a 1983 winner in several categories, has been spelled Irresistable in Adult Video News for fifteen straight years. The industry�s not only vulgar, it�s predictably vulgar. All the clich�s are true. The typical porn producer really is the ugly little man with a bad toupee and a pinkie-ring the size of a Rolaids. The typical porn director really is the guy who uses the word class as a noun to mean refinement. The typical porn starlet really is the lady in Lycra eveningwear with tattoos all down her arms who�s both smoking and chewing gum while telling journalists how grateful she is to Wadcutter Productions Ltd. for footing her breast-enlargement bill. And meaning it. The whole AVN Awards weekend comprises what Mr. Dick Filth calls an Irony-Free Zone. But of course we should keep in mind that vulgar has many dictionary definitions and that only a couple of these have to do w/ lewdness or bad taste. At root, vulgar just means popular on a mass scale. It is the semantic opposite of pretentious or snobby. It is humility with a comb-over. It is Nielsen ratings and Barnum�s axiom and the real bottom line. It is big, big business.  Thirty-four-year-old porn actor Cal Jammer killed himself in 1995. Starlets Shauna Grant, Nancy Kelly, Alex Jordan, and Savannah have all killed themselves in the last decade. Savannah and Jordan received AVN�s Best New Starlet awards in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Savannah killed herself after getting mildly disfigured in a car accident. Alex Jordan is famous for having addressed her suicide note to her pet bird. Crewman and performer Israel Gonzalez killed himself at a porn company warehouse in 1997.  An LA-based support group called PAW (=Protecting Adult Welfare) runs a 24-hour crisis line for people in the adult industry. A fundraiser for PAW was held at a Mission Hills CA bowling alley last November. It was a nude bowling tournament. Dozens of starlets agreed to take part. Two or three hundred adult-video fans showed up and paid to watch them bowl naked. No production companies or their executives participated or gave money. The fundraiser took in $6,000, which is slightly less than two one-millionths of porn�s yearly gross.  As you know if you�ve seen Casino, Showgirls, Bugsy, etc., there are really three Las Vegases. Binion�s, where the World Series of Poker is always played, exemplifies the �Old Vegas,� centered around Fremont Street. Las Vegas�s future is even now under late-stage construction at the very end of the Strip, on the outskirts of town (where US malls always go up); it�s to be a bunch of theme-parkish, more �family-oriented� venues of the kind that De Niro describes so plangently at the end of Casino.  But Las Vegas as most of us see it, Vegas qua Vegas, comprises the dozen or so hotels that flank the Strip�s middle. Vegas Populi: the opulent, intricate, garish, ecstatically decadent hotels, cathedra to gambling, partying, and live entertainment of the most microphone- swinging sort. The Sands. The Sahara. The Stardust. MGM Grand, Maxim. All within a small radius. Yearly utility expenditures on neon well into seven figures. Harrah�s, Casino Royale (with its big 24-hour Denny�s attached), Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace. The Mirage, with its huge laddered waterfall always lit up. Circus Circus. Treasure Island, with its intricate facade of decks and rigging and mizzens and vang. The Luxor, shaped like a ziggurat from Babylon of yore. Barbary Coast, whose sign out front says CASH YOUR PAYCHECK�WIN UP TO $25,000. These hotels are the Vegas we know. The land of Lola and Wayne. Of Siegfried and Roy, Copperfield. Showgirls in towering headdress. Sinatra�s sandbox. Most of them built in the �50s and �60s, the era of mob chic and entertainment-cum-industry. Half-hour lines for taxis. Smoking not just allowed but encouraged. Toupees and convention nametags and women in furs of all hue. A museum that features the World�s Biggest Coke Bottle. The Harley-Davidson Cafe, with its tympanum of huge protruding hawg; Bally�s H&C, with its row of phallic pillars all electrified and blinking in grand mal sync. A city that pretends to be nothing but what it is, an enormous machine of exchange�of spectacle for money, of sensation for money, of money for more money, of pleasure for whatever be tomorrow�s abstract cost.  Nor let us forget Vegas�s synecdoche and beating heart. It�s kittycorner from Bally�s: Caesars Palace. The granddaddy. As big as 20 Wal-Marts end to end. Real marble and fake marble, carpeting you can pass out on without contusion, 130,000 square feet of casino alone. Domed ceilings, clerestories, barrel vaults. In Caesars Palace is America conceived as a new kind of Rome: conqueror of its own people. An empire of Self. It�s breathtaking. The winter�s light rain makes all the neon bleed. The whole thing is almost too pretty to stand. There could be no site but Las Vegas�s Caesars for modern porn�s Awards show�here, the AAVNAs are one more spectacle. Way more tourists and conventioneers recognize the starlets than you�d expect. Double-takes all over the hotel. Even just standing around or putting coins in a slot machine, the performers become a prime attraction. Las Vegas doesn�t miss a trick.  The Annual AVN Awards are always scheduled to coincide with the International Consumer Electronics Show (a.k.a. CES), which this year runs from 8 through 11 January. The CES is a very big deal. It�s like a combination convention and talent show for the best and brightest in the world of consumer tech. Steve Forbes is here, and DSS�s Thomson. Sun Microsystems is using this year�s CES to launch its PersonalJava 1.0. Bill Gates gives a packed-house speech on Saturday morning. Major players from TV, cable, and merchandising host a panel on the short-term viability of HDTV. A forum on the problem of product returns by disgruntled customers seats 1,500 and is SRO. The CES as a whole is bigger than your correspondents� hometowns. It�s spread out over four different hotels and has 10,000+ booths with everything from �The First Ever Full Text Message Pager in a Wristwatch� to the world�s premier self-heating home satellite dish (�The Snow and Ice Solution!�).  But far and away the CES�s most popular venue, with total attendance well over 100,000 every year, is what is called the Adult Software5 exhibition, despite the fact that the CES itself treats the Adult tradeshow kind of like the crazy relative in the family and keeps it way out in what used to be the parking garage of the Sands hotel. This facility, a serious bus ride from all the other CES sites, is an enormous windowless all-cement space that during show hours manages to induce both agoraphobia and claustrophobia. A big sign says you have to be 21 to get in. The median age inside is 45, almost all males, nearly everyone wearing some sort of conventioneer�s nametag. Every production company in the adult industry, from Anabolic to Zane, has a booth here. The really big companies have booths that are sprawling and multidisplay and more like small strip malls. A lot of porn�s top female performers are contract players, exclusive vendors to one particular production company; and one reason why a lot of the starlets seem kind of tired and cranky by Saturday night�s Awards gala is that they will have spent much of the previous 72 hours at their companies� CES booths, on their feet all day in vertiginous heels, signing autographs and posing for pictures and pressing all manner of flesh. The best way to describe the sonic environment at the �98 CES is: Imagine that the apocalypse took the form of a cocktail party. Male fans move through the fractal maze of booths in groups of three or more. Their expressions tend to be those of junior-high boys at a peephole, an expression that looks pretty surreal on a face with jowls and no hairline. Some among them are video retailers; most are not. Most are just hard-core fans, the industry�s breath and bread. A lot of them not only recognize but seem to know the names, stage names, and curricula vitae of almost all the female performers.  It takes an average of two hours and twelve minutes to traverse the Adult CES expo, counting an average of four delays for getting lost after a chicane turn or some baroque ceiling-high cheval glass designed to double the visual exposure of Heatwave Video�s display for Texas Dildo Masquerade gets you all turned around. Your correspondents are accompanied by Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, who have very generously offered to act as guides and docents, and here is a random spatter of the things we see the first time we come in:  A second-tier Arrow Video starlet in a G-string poses for a photo, forked dorsally over the knee of a morbidly obese cellphone retailer from suburban Philadelphia. The guy taking the picture, whose CES nametag says Hi and that his name is Sherm, addresses the starlet as �babe� and asks her to readjust so as to �give us a little more bush down there.� An Elegant Angel starlet with polyresin wings attached to her back is eating a Milky Way bar while she signs video boxes. Actor Steven St. Croix is standing near the Caballero Home Video booth, saying to no one in particular �Let me out of here, I can�t wait to get out of here.�6 Adult-video stores all have a distinctive smell�a mix of cheap magnetic tape and disinfectant�and the Sands� former parking garage is rank with it. Asian businessmen move through the aisles in dense graceful packs and are assiduously cheery and polite. A young guy in a full-color Frankenstein T-shirt is spraypainting cartoon flames on an actress�s breasts at the Sin City booth. The actress�an obscure one, not even Filth and Hecuba know her name�has normal-size breasts, and there�s not much of an audience. Producer/director Max Hardcore draws a way bigger crowd at the MAXWORLD booth, where one of his girls is squatting on the countertop masturbating with the butt of a riding crop. Max�s videos� promotional posters have him carrying a girl in minishorts over his shoulder against the backdrop of various city skylines; the pitches at the bottom say �SEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL! SEE CUM-SPLATTERED GIRLS TOO STUPID TO KNOW BETTER!� Max is a story all to himself, according to Harold Hecuba. D. Filth and a porn executive dressed entirely in Campbell Nightwatch plaid are smoking cigars and keep holding their cigars up together and comparing the ash to see which one has the cleanest burn. A lot of the industry males and even some of the starlets are also smoking cigars. 1998 is definitely the Year of the Cigar. The starlets are all in either extremely formal cocktail dresses or else abbreviated latex/vinyl/ Lycra ensembles. Heels are uniformly sharp and ultrahigh. Some of the starlets are so heavily made up they look embalmed. They tend to have complexly coiffed hair that looks really good from 20 feet away but on closer inspection is dry and dead. Someone who is either sometime-performer Jeff Marton or �Bizarro-Sleaze� filmmaker Gregory Dark is doing sleight-of-hand tricks with his trademark fedora.7 Whoever he is, he has a goatee. Harold Hecuba also has a goatee; Dick Filth has more like a soul patch. H.H. and D.F., longtime industry journalists, know everybody here and keep getting stopped and drawn into conversations. (These delays, during which yr. corresps. sort of stand there awkwardly at the edge of the conversation and try to look around as if they too know people here and are waiting only to spot them in the crowd before they go off and get into their own involved conversations, have not been included in the 132-minute Adult CES-traversal average.) This year, a good 75 percent of the males in and around the porn industry appear to be sporting variants of the goatee.8  Next to the Outlaw Video booth, a starlet in a gold lam� spaghetti-strap gown, chewing gum and blowing large blue bubbles, is being videotaped by a disabled fan whose camera and parabolic mike are bolted to the arm of his wheelchair; the starlet is pointing to the tattoos on her left arm and appears to be explaining the origin and context of each one. At the Vivid Video multibooth complex,9 Ms. Taylor Hayes has what is probably the longest autograph-and-flesh-press line in the entire Sands garage. Taylor is major-league pretty�she looks like a slightly debauched Cindy Crawford�and an oversize monitor suspended from the ceiling over the Vivid area plays clips of her scantily clad and dancing amid dry-ice fumes. There�s a berm of boxed videos on the floor by the counter and a huge man with a visor and handheld credit card machine on Taylor�s right flank as she greets each fan like a long-lost relative. According to Dick Filth, Taylor is both a genuinely nice person and a consummate pro.  The booth for XPlor Media�a company known for its �Southern Belles� video series and ORGY FOR WORLD PEACE Website�is arresting because all the execs at XPlor seem to be under 25 and the booth�s atmosphere is that of a fraternity party in its third straight day. One young bald guy is unconscious in a fetal position on the counter, and some wag has glued all sorts of feathers and flaccid plastic two-headed dildoish things to his skull. XPlor�s owner-auteurs are two brothers, trust-fund babies from a Connecticut suburb of NYC. Their names are Farrel and Moffitt Timlake. Farrel, who wears twelve-hole Doc Martens and cargo pants and what�s either a very light parka or very heavy sweatshirt with a hood that stays up at all times, is a particular cause c�l�bre at the �98 CES because he�s apparently a friend of the two guys who do South Park, and these guys are rumored to be in Vegas and to possess tickets to Saturday�s Awards banquet.10  Everyone without exception is sweating. At all but a few of the booths, contract starlets treat the fans with the same absent, rigid-faced courtesy that flight attendants and restaurant hostesses tend to use. You can tell how bored the performers are by the way their faces light up when they see someone they know. Well over half of the industry�s current superstars are in this huge room.11 The infamous T.T. Boy is here, standing alone with his trademark glower, the Boy who is rumored to bring a semiautomatic pistol with him to the set and who was featured in a 1995 New Yorker article that was full of lines like �A porn shoot is an intricately delineated ecology.� Mr. Vince Vouyer (sic) is on hand, as are Seth Gecko, Jake Steed, Serenity, Missy, and Nick East. Here is the ageless Randy West, who looks just the way a surfer would look if that surfer were also a Mob enforcer, with his perennial tan and hair like frozen surf. Mr. Jon Dough�winner of AVN�s coveted Best Actor/Video statuette in both �96 and �97�alternates between various booths, wearing his customary expression of having psychologically evolved to the point where he�s so incredibly cool and detached that life is one long yawn. Here also is Mark Davis, far and away the most handsome of the current males, a near-double for Gregory Harrison of the old Trapper John series except for Davis�s ultrashort psych-patient haircut (plus goatee).  And 20-year veteran Joey Silvera is at this year�s CES, though mostly in his capacity as an auteur: Silvera now directs Evil Angel�s popular �Butt Row� video series.12 Following the lead of pioneers like John Leslie and Paul Thomas, most of today�s top male stars now also direct (and, per the store boxes, �Present�) their own line of videos, e.g. �Tom Byron�s Cumback Pussy� series, �Jon Dough�s Dirty Stories,� the eye-popping Rocco Siffredi�s �[Various European Cities] By Night� line, etc. The So-and-So Presents series seems to be an industry trend, like cigars and goatees.  It is difficult to describe how it feels to gaze at living human beings whom you�ve seen perform in hard-core porn. To shake the hand of a man whose precise erectile size, angle, and vasculature are known to you. That strange I-think-we�ve-met-before sensation one feels upon seeing any celebrity in the flesh is here both intensified and twisted. It feels intensely twisted to see reigning industry queen Jenna Jameson chilling out at the Vivid booth in Jordaches and a latex bustier and to know already that she has a tattoo of a sundered valentine with the tagline HEART BREAKER on her right buttock and a tiny hairless mole just left of her anus. To watch Peter North try to get a cigar lit and to have that sight backlit by memories of his artilleryesque ejaculations.13 To have seen these strangers� faces in orgasm�that most unguarded and purely neural of expressions, the one so vulnerable that for centuries you basically had to marry a person to get to see it.14 This weirdness may account for some of the complex emotional intercourse taking place between the performers and fans at the Adult CES. The patrons may leer and elbow one another at a distance, but by the time the men get to the front of the line and face the living incarnation of their VCR�s fantasy-babe, most of them turn into quivering goggle-eyed schoolboys, sheepish and salivaless and damp. The same thing evidently happens at the hundreds of strip clubs all over the country where porn starlets appear as Featured Dancers (for five figures a week, according to Filth) and do photos and autographs after the show:  �Most of these guys become incredibly nervous when I come up to them,� veteran starlet Shane has explained. �I�ll put my arms around a guy and his whole body will be trembling. They pretty much do whatever I tell them to do.� The whole industry, now, has this oddly reversed equation�the consumers are the ones who seem ashamed or shy, while the performers are cocky and smooth and 100 percent pro. It is no longer the 1980s, and the Meese Commission mentality that led to a major crackdown on video porn is long gone. Federal task forces and PTA outrage are now focused on the Internet and kiddie porn. But today�s adult industry is still hypersensitive about what it perceives as fascist attacks on its First Amendment freedoms. A specially prepared trailer now runs before many higher-end adult videos, right between the legal disclaimer on the product�s compliance with or exemption from 18 U.S.C �2257 and ads for phone services like 900-666-FUCK. Against shots of flowing flags and the Lincoln Memorial, a voiceover says stuff like:  Censorship goes against our Bill of Rights and the founding principles of this country. It is an attempt on the part of the government to legislate morality and to stifle free expression.15 This new, �legal� morality is dangerous to all Americans. Vote for those who believe in limiting government intrusion into your personal affairs. Vote against government control of your life and home. Vote against censorship. Only you, the People, can keep the American ideal intact.  These trailers always say they�re sponsored by either the Adult Video Association or something called the Free Speech Coalition. Both organizations (and the extent to which the two are separate is unclear) are basically industry PACs. Porn, in other words, has taken the political lessons of the �80s to heart; it is now a hard-lobbying political force no less than GM or RJR Nabisco.  Feminists of all different stripe oppose the adult industry for reasons having to do with pornography�s putative effects on women. Their arguments are well-known and in some respects persuasive. But certain antiporn arguments in the 1990s are now centered on adult entertainment�s alleged effects on the men who consume it. Some �masculists� believe that a lot of men get addicted to video porn in a way that causes grievous psychic harm. Example: An essayist named David Mura has a little book called A Male Grief: Notes on Pornography and Addiction, which is a bit New Agey but interesting in places, e.g.:  At the essence of pornography is the image of flesh used as a drug, a way of numbing psychic pain. But this drug lasts only as long as the man stares at the image� . In pornographic perception, each gesture, each word, each image, is read first and foremost through sexuality. Love or tenderness, pity or compassion, become subsumed by, and are made subservient to, a �greater� deity, a more powerful force� . The addict to pornography desires to be blinded, to live in a dream. Those in the thrall of pornography try to eliminate from their consciousness the world outside pornography, and this includes everything from their family and friends or last Sunday�s sermon to the political situation in the Middle East. In engaging in such elimination the viewer reduces himself. He becomes stupid. This kind of stuff might sound a little out-there, maybe, until one observes the eerie similarity between the eyes of males in strip clubs or stroke parlors and the eyes of people in their fifth hour of pumping silver dollars into the slot machines of the Sands� casino, or maybe until one�s seen firsthand the odd kind of shock on the faces of CES patrons seeing performers now �in the flesh,� complete with chewing gum and chin-pimples and all the human stuff you never see�never want to see�in films.  Maybe just a little bit more here on the whole scene at the Adult CES, which is a lot more of a rub-elbows-type venue than the stylized Awards ceremony is going to end up being� . Mr. Harold Hecuba is deep in conversation with a marginal porn producer about one of his performers� being sidelined with something called a �prolapsed sphincter,� which condition yr. corresps. decline to follow up on in any way. We are standing just west of a staff writer for Digital Horizons who�s dropped by to scope out the legendary scene in here again this year and is telling two presumed other tech writers that being around porn people always makes him feel like he�s been somehow astrally projected onto a cocktail napkin. It is also roughly now that Ms. Jasmin St. Claire is making an appearance at the Impressive Media booth in order to spell the starlet behind the counter, who is limping to the booth�s rear area; she (i.e., the limping starlet) has (reportedly) had to be sprayed with silicon to fit into her pants. The crowd at the Impressive Media venue immediately starts to enlarge. Jasmin St. Claire is wearing a red vinyl jacket-and-miniskirt ensemble. A porn starlet entering any kind of room or area has a distinctive energy about her�you turn your head to look even if you don�t seem to want to. It�s like watching a figure from a pinball machine illustration or high-concept comic book step out into 3-D and head your way. It turns out really to be possible to feel as though your eyeballs are protruding slightly from their sockets. What makes the whole thing so weird is that Jasmin St. Claire isn�t even all that pretty, at least not today. Her hair is dyed black in that cheap unreal Goth way, and she is so incredibly heavily made up that she looks like a crow. (She is also somewhat knock-kneed, plus of course has the requisite Howitzer-grade bust.) Ms. St. Claire is being escorted to the Impressive booth by two large men whose expressions are describable only as mug-shottish. This is another thing about porn starlets�they�re never alone. They�re always accompanied by at least one and sometimes as many as four flinty-eyed males. The impression is that of a very expensive thoroughbred being led onto the track under a silk blanket.  FYI, Ms. Jasmin St. Claire�s cult-celebrity status at the �98 CES stems from her having broken the �World Gang Bang Record�16 by taking on 300 men in a row in Amazing Pictures� 1996 World�s Biggest Gang Bang 2. Since most of these 300 men were amateur porn-fans who�d had only to fill out an application and produce an HIV all-clear from the DPH, she now enjoys an almost legendary populist appeal��the People�s Porn Star��and an enormous serpentine line of fans with cameras and autographable memorabilia has formed at the Impressive booth, which line Ms. St. Claire appears for the moment to be ignoring, because she and H. Hecuba, having exchanged double-cheek kisses, are now deep into some kind of t�te-�-t�te above the sockless Docksiders of the unconscious bald kid, who�s (the kid has) evidently been carried or trundled by pranksters unknown from the XPlor counter (right next door) to this one. Dick Filth�after your correspondents have remarked on how it�s kind of heartwarming that everyone in the porn industry all seem to be friends, even critics and performers�dishes an involved anecdote about how Jasmin St. Claire apparently once actually tried to strangle Harold Hecuba at an industry soir�e a couple years ago, an anecdote which, if you�re interested, appears as FN17 just below. Twenty feet away, over at XPlor, Mr. Farrel Timlake has meanwhile produced what is alleged to be the prototype and world�s only authorized Kenny� Action Figure from the upcoming South Park merchandising line�fourteen inches tall, kind of heavy for a doll, w/ hood up and face obscured (not unlike F. Timlake�s own hood and face)�and is entertaining some of the IM crowd�s spillover by manipulating the doll�s limbs to simulate its �tok[ing] a bone.�  Not unlike urban gangs, police, carnival workers, and certain other culturally marginalized guilds, the US porn industry is occluded and insular in a way that makes it seem like high school. There are cliques, anticliques, alliances, betrayals, conflagratory rumors, legendary enmities, and public bloodlettings, plus involved hierarchies of popularity and influence. You�re either In or you�re not. Performers, being the industry�s fissile core, are of course In. Despite their financial power, studio execs and producers are not very In, and directors (especially those who�ve never undergone the initiation of having on-camera sex themselves) are less In than the performers. Film reviewers and industry journalists are even less In than execs; and nonindustry journalists are way, way non-In, almost as low-caste as the great mass of porn fans themselves (for which fans the Insider term is: mook18 ).  The foregoing is meant to help explain how exactly your correspondents ended up in porn titan Max Hardcore�s personal suite at the Sahara and got to hang out in the suite�s living room with Max, certain of his crew, porn starlets Alex Dane and Caressa Savage, and two B-girls�which is to say that it was actually Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth who were invited to hang out in the suite on Friday afternoon, but yr. corresps. clung almost like papooses to their backs, and the burly MAXWORLD Production Assistant wasn�t quick enough about slamming the door. So yr. corresps. were, for a couple hours, at least logistically speaking, In.  For a regular civilian male, hanging out in a hotel suite with porn starlets is a tense and emotionally convolved affair. There is, first, the matter of having seen the various intimate activities and anatomical parts of these starlets in videos heretofore and thus (weirdly) feeling shy about meeting them. But there is also a complex erotic tension. Because porn films� worlds are so sexualized, with everybody seemingly teetering right on the edge of coitus all the time and it taking only the slightest nudge or excuse�a stalled elevator, an unlocked door, a cocked eyebrow, a firm handshake�to send everyone tumbling into a tangled mass of limbs and orifices, there�s a bizarre unconscious expectation/dread/ hope that this is what might happen in Max Hardcore�s hotel room. Yr. corresps. here find it impossible to overemphasize the fact that this is a delusion. In fact, of course, the unconscious expectation/dread/hope makes no more sense than it would make to be hanging out with doctors at a medical convention and to expect that at the slightest provocation everyone in the room would tumble into a frenzy of MRIs and epidurals. Nevertheless the tension persists, despite the fact that the actresses are obviously tired and disassociated from the day�s CES,19 plus, it emerges, somewhat sore�it turns out that Max Hardcore is shooting one of his �Gonzo� porn spectaculars right here at the 1998 Consumer Electronics Show, using the CES as a hook and backdrop, and the girls have been alternating CES booth-duty and riding-crop shenanigans with a tight and SS-intensive filming schedule. (Max, being a firm believer in the fait accompli method of filmmaking, has not yet gotten around to chatting with the CES�s administration about his featuring the world�s biggest consumer-tech tradeshow by name in a �SEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL� video.)  Mr. Max Hardcore�a.k.a. Max Steiner, a.k.a. Paul Steiner, n� Paul Little�is 5'6" and a very fit 135. He is somewhere between 40 and 60 years old and resembles more than anything a mesomorphic and borderline-psycho Henry Gibson. He is wearing a black cowboy hat and what has to be one of the very few long-sleeved Hawaiian shirts in existence anywhere. Once the PA guarding the door mellows out and introductions are made (H.H. managing to drop the name of this magazine several times in one sentence), Max reveals himself to be a genial and garrulous host and offers everybody disposable plastic cups of vodka before settling in with yr. corresps. to discuss what for Max are the most pressing and relevant issues at this year�s AVN Awards, which issues are the career, reputation, personal history, and overall life philosophy of Mr. Max Hardcore.  Pioneered (depending whom you talk to) by either Max Hardcore or John (�Buttman�) Stagliano, �Gonzo� has become one of this decade�s most popular and profitable genres of adult video. It�s more or less a cross between an MTV documentary and the Hell panel from Bosch�s Garden of Earthly Delights. A Gonzo film is always set at some distinctive locale or occasion�Daytona Beach at spring break, the Cannes Film Festival, etc. There�s always a randy and salivous �host� talking directly to a handheld camera: �Well and we�re here at the Cannes Film Festival, and it looks like there�s going to be lots of excitement, John Travolta and Sigourney Weaver are supposed to both be in town, and there�s also the world-famous beach, and I�m told there�s always some real seriously good-looking little girls at the beach, so let�s us head on down.� (That�s the approximate lead-in to a recent Max-at-Cannes Gonzo, a type of signature lead-in that Max refers to with a 56-tooth grin as �always mercifully brief��and please note the �little girls at the beach� thing, because this is another of Max�s professional signatures, the infantilization of his videos� females as dramatic foils for his own film persona, which is always that of a sort of degenerate uncle or stepdad.) Then the shaky but ever-focused camera heads on down to the ocean or mall or CES or whatever, scoping out attractive women20 while the host moans and chews his knuckle in lust. Then pretty soon host and camera start actually coming up to the women they�ve been looking at and engaging them in little cameo �interviews� full of sideways leers and salacious entendres. Some of the interviewees are actual civilians, but some are always what Max refers to as �ringers,� meaning professional porn actresses. And so the viewer is treated to the classic frathouse fantasy of moving, via just a couple of singles-bar �Hey there babe� lines, from scoping out an attractive woman to having wild and anatomically diverse sex with her, all while one of his buddies captures the whole thing on tape.21  The issue of who exactly invented Gonzo being impossibly vexed and so notwithstanding, it is true that Max Hardcore is famous as a director for several things: (1) Being incredibly disciplined about budgets and tactical logistics, right down to forcing his crew and staff to wear identical jumpsuits of scarlet nylon so that they look like a national ski team�Max�s shoots are described (by Max) as �almost military operations�; (2) Not only employing ringers but actually sometimes being able to talk real live civilian �little girls� on the beach or in the mall into coming on back to the special MAXWORLD RV and having anal sex on camera;22 (3) Being the first in �mainstream� (meaning nonfetish) adult video to perpetrate on women levels of violation and degradation that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. W/r/t item (3), Max, after detailing for yr. correspondents the vo- and avocations that led him into the adult industry (a tale too literally incredible even to think about factchecking and trying to print), informs us that he is and always has been adult video�s �cutting-edge blade,� and that other less bold and original filmmakers have systematically stolen and used his, Max�s, degradations of women as a blueprint for their own subsequent shabby and derivative films� degradations.23 (Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, by the way, have heard Max hold forth many times before and are now outside the circle of discourse�D.F. in the bathroom for what seems like a peculiarly long time, H.H. on the couch with the actresses hashing out the implications of Seinfeld�s retirement for NBC�s �98 lineup.)  Alone and in a place of conspicuous honor on a wood-finish shelf above the suite�s minibar is an actual AVN Awards statuette. The trophy resembles an Oscar/Emmy/Clio except that the figurine�s arms are up and out (making it also look a bit like Richard Nixon at the climax of the �68 GOP convention), and something slightly blurry about the casting gives it a sort of cubic-zirconium aspect. Whether the statuette is heavy and solid vs. hollow and Little Leaguish remains unknown�there is no invitation to touch or heft it. One of the B-girls on the couch is now either laughing or weeping into her hands at something Harold Hecuba has said; her bare shoulders heave. It would be totally fantastic if the Seinfeld rerun on the huge TV were the episode about everybody trying to refrain from masturbating, but it isn�t.  Asked by one of yr. corresps. what he won this AVN Award on the shelf for, Max Hardcore slaps his knee: �I fucking stole it.� It�s now that hard middle-distance inspection reveals that the MAX HARDCORE on the metal strip at the trophy�s base has been scratched in by someone who is not a professional engraver. It looks done with a screwdriver, in fact. Max expands on the statuette caper: Shut inexplicably out of the Awards for years, he last year, upon exiting the stage (he�s always a presenter every year, which he regards as the AVNAs� way of twisting the emotional blade), espied in the wings a large cardboard box filled with blank and unused AVN Award statuettes.24 Whereupon he thought, as he now puts it, �What the fuck, I fucking deserve it� and snagged one, hiding it in his enormous Stetson and deriving no little satisfaction from attending various post-Awards parties with an illicit statuette under his hat. Max�s crew all laugh very hard at this anecdote, though the actresses don�t.  Alex Dane is now telling Harold Hecuba about a stray dog she found and has decided to keep. She is excited as she describes the dog and for a moment seems about fourteen; the impression lasts only a second or two and is heartbreaking. One of the B-girls, meanwhile, is explaining that she has just gotten a pair of cutting-edge breast implants that she can actually adjust the size of by adding or draining fluid via small valves under her armpits, and then�perhaps mistaking your correspondents� expressions for ones of disbelief�she raises her arms to display the valves. There really are what appear to be valves.  So much about today�s adult industry seems like an undeft parody of Hollywood and the nation writ large. The top performers are comic-book caricatures of sexual allure. The prosthetic breasts and lifted buttocks and (no kidding) artificial cheekbones are nothing more than accentuations of a mentality that yields huge liposuction and collagen industries. The gynecologically explicit sexuality of Jenna, Jasmin, et al. seems more than anything like a Mad magazine spoof of the �smoldering� sexuality of Sharon Stone and Madonna and so many other mainstream iconettes.25 Not to mention the fact that the adult industry takes many of the psychological deformities that Hollywood is famous for�the vanity, the vulgarity, the rank commercialism�and not only makes them overt and grotesque but seems then to revel in that grotesquerie.  Good old Max Hardcore, for instance, is a total psychopath�that�s part of his on-screen Gonzo persona�but so is the real Max/Paul Steiner. You�d almost have to have been there in that suite. Max sits holding court in his hat and pointy boots, looking at once magisterial and mindless, while his red-suited acolytes laugh on cue and a jr. high dropout shows off her valves. In truth, the first ten minutes of the impromptu interview in the Sahara are spent passing around a copy of something called Icon magazine, which Max has told us is doing a profile on him�we are expected to leaf through the magazine and comment favorably on its content and layout while Max watches us in the same hyperexpectant way that parents watch you when you�re looking at a snapshot of their kid that they�ve taken out uninvited and pressed on you. This is the actual chronology. There then follows a torrent of autobiography and background that yr. corresps. have decided to deny Max the satisfaction of seeing reproduced here. After which is a kind of Max 101-like survey of personal philosophy and Gonzo theory and the statuette anecdote. The vodka is top-shelf and the plastic cups dusty. Then one of the starlets decides that she�s hungry, and Max insists on escorting her down to the Sahara�s restaurant and wants everybody else to come along, which eventually results in the B-girls and crewmen and yr. corresps.26 all standing there awkwardly at the ma�tre d�s podium while Max personally conducts the starlet to her table and pulls out her chair and tucks a serviette into her cleavage and pulls out a platinum-plated money clip and announces in a voice audible to everyone in the restaurant and foyer that he �want[s] to take care of the little girl�s damages in advance� and shoves bills into the hanky-pocket of the ma�tre d�s tuxedo and then leaves her there by herself and herds us all back out and into the elevator and jabs impatiently at the button for his suite�s floor, almost jumping up and down with fury at the elevator�s delay; and we�re all rushed back up to the suite because it�s occurred to Max that he wants to show your corresps. something from this week�s filming that he thinks will sum up his particular porn genius better than any amount of exposition could � and then, reseated, he starts flipping through a notebook to find something.  �What it is is we got this one little girl back in the [infamous MAXWORLD] trailer, and after some face-fucking27 and reaming her asshole and, like, your standard depravities, we get her to stick a pen�no, a what-do-you-call ��  Crewman: �Magic Marker.�  Max: �� Magic Marker, stick it up her asshole and write all this � this stuff,� holding up the notebook, opened to a page; again he has us pass it around:  is thereon written in a hand28 that seems impressively legible, considering. Dick Filth makes a waggish inquiry about future film plans involving this girl and a typewriter, but Max doesn�t laugh (we noticed that Max never laughs at a joke he hasn�t told), and so neither does anyone else.  Doubtless most of this is going to get cut by Premiere, but it�s worth also observing�when this magazine�s assigned photographer (who�s also gotten in here with us this afternoon on H.H. and D.F.�s coattails) begins wondering aloud about the possibility of getting some good portraits at the Awards of winners holding their statuettes�the way Max right away jumps in with his idea of the perfect photo for the title page of this very article. The proposed shot is to be of Max Hardcore, holding several of the AVN Awards trophies he pledges either to win straight up or to gain possession of in other ways, seated in some kind of imperial-looking and really nice chair that is itself set up on the palm-studded boulevard of the famous Las Vegas Strip�so the photographer�ll get lots of smeary neon and appropriately phallic bldgs. in the background�with a retinue of scantily clad starlets either draped swoonily over him or prostrate at his feet, or both. It is important to note that there are no audible scare-quotes, no irony or embarrassment or self-awareness of any sort on Max�s face as he sketches this photo�s tableau for us; he�s in the kind of earnest that one imagines Irving Thalberg was always in.29 Your correspondents immediately begin to lobby hard for Max�s idea, figuring that the photo would make a great illustration for the story of Max�s proposing this very photo�i.e., that it would point up the megalomania far more powerfully than mere reportage�but the Premiere photographer, who is no actor, does such a poor job of disguising his repulsion at Max�s self-regard that the atmosphere of the whole suite gets stilted and complexly hostile, and the rest of the interview is kind of a fizzle-yield, and overall Dick Filth said that we failed, in his phrase, to �penetrate to the core of the essence of what it is to be Max Hardcore.�30  The 15th Annual AVN Awards are actually split over two consecutive nights, a tactic that Max H. thought the legit Oscars would do well to emulate: �Get all the bullshit out of the way the first night�best packaging, marketing, best gay, shit like that. Who wants to sit through that shit?�  Held in a different, slightly smaller Caesars Palace ballroom, Friday�s Awards show is indeed brisk. The ephemeral categories include Best Videography, Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Music. Each category�s nominees are listed in the program, but only the winners are announced onstage, and they�re announced four at a time, and applause is discouraged, and the master of ceremonies keeps telling the quartets of winners that �If you�ll come on up quickly and help keep things moving it�ll help us out a lot.� Friday�s only food is big wheels of vegetables and dip near the cash bar. The emcee is not headliner Robert Schimmel but a hypomanic guy named Dave Tyree, whose interpolated banter is 78 rpm and consists of stuff like �If God didn�t want us to jerk off he would�ve made our arms shorter.� There are maybe 1,000 people in attendance, most only slightly dressed up, and there are no assigned tables, and everybody in the ballroom is moving around and chattering and treating the onstage proceedings the way people in a cocktail lounge treat the piano player.  Q. $4,000,000,000 and 8,000 new releases a year�why is adult video so popular in this country? A. Director and AVN-Hall-of-Fame inductee F. J. Lincoln: �It�s always a little funny how it�s called adult. What it really is, you get to be a kid again. You roll around and get dirty. It�s the adult sandbox.� A. Veteran woodman Joey Silvera: �Dudes, let�s face it�America wants to jerk off.� A. Industry journalist Harold Hecuba: �It�s the new Barnum. Nobody ever goes broke overestimating the rage and misogyny of the average American male.� A. Porn starlet Jacklyn Lick: �I think a lot of fans are very lonely people.� Q. There don�t seem to be a whole lot of condoms used in hard-core scenes. A. Harold Hecuba: �Never have been. They�re viewed as a turn-off. This business is about engineering fantasies.� Q. But even just venerially�all these anal shenanigans and everything. Is there much worry in the industry about HIV? A. Harold Hecuba: �There�s not as much worry about AIDS now. Everybody gets tested on a schedule.� Q. What about herpes? A. H.H.: �I think it�s rampant.�  Last year�s Best-Sex-Scene-in-a-Film winner Vince Vouyer�s real name turns out to be John LaForme. Rhetorical Q.: How, if one�s real name was John LaForme, could that person possibly feel the need for a nom de guerre?  Mr. Tom Byron describes being able to tumesce and ejaculate more or less on demand as an exercise in �control, like meditation or surfing. It�s like a gymnast staying on the balance beam. You practice enough, you can do anything.�31  Former woodman and current auteur Paul Thomas was a member of the original Broadway cast of Jesus Christ Superstar.  The tall, crazed-looking, and ever-rampant Mike Horner, three-time Best Actor winner and a member of the AVN Hall of Fame,32 is actually a classically trained opera singer.  Deceased starlet Nancy Kelly�s real name was Kelly Van Dyke. She was the daughter of TV�s Jerry Van Dyke and so, of course, the niece of Dick.  Exotic rookie actress Midori, one of the nominees in the �98 AVNAs� Best New Starlet category, is the sister of �80s pop star Jodi Whatley. Midori has stated publicly that she views upscale contemporary porn as a stepping-stone to a mainstream career, not unlike becoming Miss America or doing a couple seasons on SNL. Harold Hecuba characterizes Midori�s career strategy as �grievously ill-advised.�  Adult Video News VP and Executive Editor Gene Ross, presenting the aforementioned 1998 AVN Award for Best Director/Video to Miscreants� Rob Black, will hail Mr. Black as �a guy who can take buttholes, midgets, and fried fish, and make a love story.�33  From The New Yorker�s 1995 article on the psychosexual plight of the adult industry�s woodman: �The Cal Jammers who are part of this feminization feel they have stormed the walls of female ornament to reclaim male prerogative, only to find themselves lost in a garden of gender irony.�  Mr. John �Buttman� Stagliano�CEO of Evil Angel Inc., a man described by US News & World Report as �the nation�s leading director of hard-core videos��not only has publicly announced testing positive for HIV but has identified the infection�s vector as a transsexual prostitute in S�o Paulo with whom Stagliano had unprotected anal intercourse in 1995. He�s anxious that people not get the wrong idea: �I am not particularly interested in guys, but I am interested in dicks. Forbidden taboos lead to all sorts of neurotic behavior, which leads to me being fucked in the ass without a rubber.�  Are the AVN Awards possibly rigged? Max Hardcore (he of the purloined statuette, keep in mind) calls the Awards �a total conflict of interests.� After all, he explains, Adult Video News is heavily ad-dependent,34 and they�re under �pressure from the big hitters like Vivid and VCA to like, you know, give the nod.�  Ms. Ellen Thompson, AVN Associate Editor and an Awards judge who votes under the n.d.g. Ida Slapter:35 �We�ve heard this for years. I hear this complaining also goes on in the mainstream. I don�t like insulting anybody, but sometimes there�s sour grapes. What are we supposed to say? Vivid and VCA put out good product. We truly, honestly do vote fairly.�  Mr. Dick Filth: �The best perception, backed up by tons of anecdotal evidence, is that they are totally, totally fixed and rigged.� Saturday�s the big night. The banquet, the onstage entertainment, the headline Awards. See & be seen. Gamblers and conventioneers and mooks of all ilk are massed at the Caesars cabstand to watch the starlets arrive. There are camcorders and flashbulbs but no paparazzi per se. Some of the performers come in limos, others in shiny penile sports cars; others seem to mysteriously just suddenly appear. There are even more starlets here than there were at the CES, and they are seriously dolled up. There are cerise halters and pear-colored Lycra bodysuits with open-toed pumps of burgundy suede. There are platinum lam� gowns slit all the way to the tenth rib. Bottoms less covered than shellacked look like they by all rights should have panty- or at least thong lines but do not have such lines. There are lime-green vinyl leotards and toile bellbottoms and fishscale bustiers and miniskirts the same texture and length as a tutu�s ruffle. Garter straps flash and Merry Widow bodices shade the interiors of translucent blouses. Several of the outfits defy very basic precepts of modern physics. Coiffures are towering and complex. The starlets are all on the arms of men, but none of these escorts are male porn performers. Average heel-height is 4"+. A loud-voiced civilian in the cabstand crowd actually utters the phrase �Va Va Voom,� which yr. correspondents had never before heard anywhere outside a Sinatra movie. Breasts are uniformly zeppelinesque and in various perilous stages of semiconfinement. Max Hardcore is under a Stetson the color of weak chocolate milk, and his adjustable B-girl�arrayed in a type of scarlet cowboy suit that�s mostly fringe�has inflated her breasts to what�s got to be maximum capacity.  Woodman-wise, black is clearly In at the 15th Annual AVNAs. A lot of the men are in black tuxedos and black ties and black dress shirts. One is wearing a paisley suit of either serge or some kind of upholstery material. Another has silver platform shoes and a silver vest w/ no shirt underneath. The XPlor boys are in Klein sweatshirts and urban-camouflage fatigues, and there�s a large contingent with them that may or may not include the South Park brain trust. A guy on the arm of Ms. Morgan Fairlane has an immense and razorous violet mohawk � la British punks of the late 1970s.  Inside the hotel, a kind of impromptu cocktail party forms in the broad marble hall outside Caesars Palace�s largest and reportedly classiest ballroom, which is called Caesars Forum. Burly casino staffers stand taking tickets and being very discouraging about anybody trying to bum-rush the show. The crush of bodies out here entails a degree of physical contact that CES mooks never even dreamed of. There are pockets of klieg-glare as cable TV reporters interview various performers about (sic:) the air of keen excitement in the air. Mysterious bundles of co-ax emerge from under the Forum doors and go all the way up the length of the hallway and disappear around the corner. A suspicion that we�d had all week but decided was unverifiable is now instantly verified when one of yr. corresps. gets accidentally shoved against a starlet and is jabbed in the side by her breasts and it hurts. A lot of people are holding drinks in plastic glasses and it�s unknown where they got them. The starlets take turns getting interviewed re atmospheric excitement while the woodmen all avoid the cameras like mafiosi. The TV lights are not doing anyone�s skin tone any good at all. In their all-black tuxes, several of the male Insiders�including e.g. John Leslie and Tony Tedeschi�are so pallid and sallow as to appear diseased. Mr. Nick East devotes a full 5.5 minutes of rapt concentration to the cuticle of his left thumb. A slight surprise is that a lot of the industry�s elite woodmen are short�5'6", 5'7"36 �and most of their companions tower over them. Dick Filth confirms that the contemporary industry�s 5'6" standard helps a prodigious male organ look even more prodigious on videotape, a medium that apparently does all kinds of strange things to perspective.  Tickets for Saturday�s main event are $195 per, in advance. It�s unclear whether any Insiders� tickets are comped, but journalists pay full retail. Our tickets designate our table as #189. Twenty-five hundred tickets have been sold, and since it�s highly doubtful that anybody got past the flinty-eyed casino guys outside without a ticket, tonight�s attendance can confidently be fixed at 2,500. The Caesars Forum ballroom itself is a huge L-shape with the stage at the�as it were�joint; thus half of the 15th Annual AVN Awards� audience is geometrically invisible to the other half. This problem is addressed via six sail-sized video screens that hang from the ceiling at strategic points throughout the auditorium. During the nearly two hours37 between when the doors open and the Awards show actually starts, the screens alternate quick clips from porn classics38 (recall that the theme of the 15th AAVNAs is �The History of Adult�) with live shots of various people making their entrances and mugging for the remote cameras AVN has got circling the room.  Both Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth have come equipped with binoculars (H.H.�s in a very official-looking Audubon Society case), which seems mysterious until we all arrive at Table 189, which is at the very, very back of the ballroom�s L�s northern leg, hundreds of yards from even the nearest video screen. �They always put the print guys out in mookland,� Hecuba explains. This fact is unpleasant surprise #1. Unpleasant surprise #2 is the supper the $195 includes, which turns out to be buffet-steam-table-style and might best be described by inviting you to imagine a very cosmopolitan and multiethnic hospital cafeteria. 39 Several of the male Insiders, we now notice, have brought in their own picnic hampers.  Now moving w/ laden plate to a table near us is a man in a full-body leopardskin suit whose way of acknowledging people he knows is to point at them rather than wave at them. On his arm is a B-girl in a body stocking made of what appears to be a densely woven net. Two Astral Ocean Cinema contract starlets have on identical copper-colored beaded gowns with myriad lengthwise slits in the skirt parts� fronts and backs and sides, so that as they walk to their table their upper halves look normal and their lower halves seem to be passing through an infinity of bead curtains. Obviously, the whole scene is overwhelming. The average American rarely gets to see aerobic legwarmers with 4" spike heels. The Caesars Forum ceiling is the color of rancid meringue; it has 24 chandeliers that are designed to look like concentric opened fans but actually look more like labia or very well-organized fungus. Mr. Joey Buttafuoco is in the house, accompanying40 Al Goldstein of Screw, who is here to receive a Special AVN Achievement Award for His Lifelong Defense of the First Amendment. Black is so resoundingly In this year that even the starched linen napkins at everyone�s place settings are black. The wineglasses all have little frosted cameos of J. Caesar on them. Humorless men with walkie-talkies stand guard at each of the ballroom�s fire doors�apparently last year there were some problems with unauthorized Caesars Palace employees sneaking in to watch the gala. The video screens are now showing the climactic scene of Debbie Does Dallas, the one where the nebbishy little stand-in for all mooks everywhere finally has sex with Bambi Woods and then the screen flashes �NEXT?� The South Park boys are indeed in attendance, up at Table 37 w/ Farrel and the XPlor coterie. There are also rumors that Boogie Nights auteur Paul Thomas Anderson possesses a ticket to the gala and might show up.41  The closest thing to any kind of Insider table near ours is #182, which according to its black table-tent is reserved for Anabolic Video (not an industry force) and is currently occupied by a spiriferously coiffed and sullenly chewing Dina Jewel (who declines to return Harold Hecuba�s blown kiss) and her escort, a young fellow whom one can easily envision head-butting somebody in a mosh pit. D. Filth confides that this Anabolic guy is a close friend of woodman Vince Vouyer (again, sic), who himself is not up for many �98 Awards because he spent a good part of the past year in court and/or detention for helping operate an escort service which authorities alleged was not a bona fide escort service at all.  It turns out that Hecuba and Filth have kept from yr. correspondents as unpleasant surprise #3 the single chintziest thing about the $195-a-head 15th AAVNAs banquet & gala: Beverages are not compris. And not just alcohol, either; even a lousy club soda w/ lime42 is $6.00. Worse, it turns out you can�t run any sort of tab�you have to pay the waiter in cash when you order the lousy club soda w/ lime, and he (theoretically) brings your change back with the beverage. Thus a separate and memory-intensive transaction is required for each drink that each of the six-to-eight persons at each of the appr. 375 tables in the auditorium might order, with additional complications if certain people are buying drinks for certain tablemates but not for certain other tablemates, etc.43 The whole unfree-drink situation is incredibly annoying, not only because of the outlandish ticket price but because the ballroom�s 100 percent Middle Eastern waiters (decent and hardworking fellows all, to be sure, who are taking some serious abuse about the pay-as-you-go beverage policy from mooks with cigars at the nearby tables, despite the fact that the waiters don�t make the rules and must surely find having to remember and make change for six to eight different customers per table a piercing pain in the ass44 ) have only rudimentary ESL skills and tend to confuse both drink orders and currency denominations. Dick Filth leans over and shouts: �Now you can maybe see why this is a multibillion-a-year industry�they�re tight as a duck�s butt!�45  The crowd lingers over hypersucrotic cake and coffee and $9.00 cordials and howls conversation at itself for 90 more minutes before the house lights dim and the 15th Annual AVN Awards gala starts. What follows thereon is a kaleidoscopic flux of stilted acceptances and blue one-liners and epileptic strobes and spotlights following winners� serpentine and high five-studded paths to the stage, of everything from generic Awards Show schmaltz to moments of near-Periclean eloquence, as in e.g.:  �Fellow MENSA members and aficionados of Shakespeare!� intones Al Goldstein of Screw, 62 and obese and white-bearded and crazy-haired and dressed in a sportcoat whose lapels are two different primary colors, looking pretty much exactly like that one certain old guy in the neighborhood your mom warned you never to try to sell Cub Scout chocolate mints to, and glorying in a Special AVN Achievement Award he confesses to feeling he�s long deserved. �I want to thank my mother, who spread her legs and made all this possible.� Large sections of the crowd are on their feet�Goldstein is a porn icon. He was distributing NYC�s Screw on photostat when most of the people in this room were still playing with their toes. He�s been a First Amendment ninja. He drinks in the applause and loves it and is hard not to sort of almost actually like. He�s clearly an avatar of contemporary porn�s unabashedness, its modern Yeah-OK-I�m-Scum-but-Underneath-All-Your-Hypocrisy-So- Are-You-and-at-Least-I-Have-the-Guts-to-Admit-It-and-Have-a-Good-Time persona:  �I salute the women with eleven-IQs and the men with eleven-inch cocks. The real heroes are the cocks and pussies who fuck on-screen. They�re the real heroes.� Goldstein is less conducted than borne back to his seat.  This has followed Robert Schimmel�s intro and a 20-minute �Musical Salute to the History of Adult,� in which topless dancing girls do a medley of disco, new wave, and so on.46 The stage band is ragged and unevenly amplified, and they all have flared collars and tight perms�it�s like watching The Brady Bunch�s final season through borrowed binoculars. The stage is lit by autotrack spotlights whose colors alternate w/o discernible scheme.  The whole 15th AAVNAs Show lasts 3.5 hours and resembles nothing so much as an obscene and extremely well-funded high school assembly. The mix of garish self-congratulation47 and clumsy choreography is often so weird as to be endearing. There are never fewer than six presenters for each award, and they never seem to know whose turn it is to announce a nominee, and there are always a couple who don�t get close enough to the mike to be audible and a couple others who get too close to the mike and produce a jolt of feedback that sends people and cocktails flying out of chairs in the first rows of tables. Wicked Pictures� Satyr, a multiple-category nominee, gets repeatedly pronounced �Satter.� Winners are supposed to exit stage-left after their acceptance speeches, but even people who�ve won and been through the process several times in recent years keep forgetting and trying to exit stage-right and colliding with the hostesses who are there to escort them leftward. Some presenters insert brief rote antidrug messages into their intros, while around them twitch and sniff other presenters�not many, but some�who are obviously coked to the gills.  Probably the most neutral and economical thing to say is that large parts of the ceremony are unintentionally funny. Winning woodmen extend earnest thanks to directors and execs for giving them �an opening� or �a shot� or �my big shot� and seem wholly unaware of the carnal entendres involved. Back at the journalists� table with us is a 40ish woman in two-piece Armani who�s doing a spot on the Awards for ABC Radio; she spends most of the evening hunched over with her head in her hand and her tape recorder not even on. Dick Filth spends the show�s whole second hour trying to track down a waiter who owes him beverage change. AVN�s Gene Ross pays tribute to �98�s Male Performer of the Year by saying: �You haven�t lived until you�ve seen Tom Byron�s wrinkled nuts on a seventy-inch TV screen.� Rob Black�s Miscreants keeps getting nominated in category after category, and time and again there�s a frantic caucus at the podium about the correct pronunciation of miscreant, complete with a couple of presenters audibly whispering what in the fuck is the word even supposed to mean.48  To be fair, some of the nominated products� titles are genuinely confusing. Triple Penetration Debutante Sluts 4 is up for Most Outrageous Sex Scene�along with Wild Bananas on Butt Row and 87 and Still Bangin��but loses out to a scene the Program entitles �Anal Food Express�49 from a video called My Girlfriend�s Girlfriend. Paul Thomas�s Bad Wives wins Best Film. Evil Angel�s Buda wins Best Shot-on-Video Feature. The Best Foreign Release statuette goes to something European called President By Day, Hooker By Night. Bad Wives also wins Best Actress/Film for Dyanna Lauren, Best Supporting Actress/Film for Melissa Hill, and Best Anal Sex Scene/Film50 for Lauren and Steven St. Croix. Best Compilation Tape honors go to The Voyeur�s Favorite Blow Jobs & Anals. David Cronenberg�s mainstream Crash comes out of absolutely nowhere to win something called Best Alternative Adult Feature Film. Ms. Stephanie Swift wins Best Actress/Video and tells the crowd: �Thanks, everybody. My gang bang was a blast.�51  Max Hardcore, to Table 189�s immense and unkind delight, doesn�t win one single thing.  An actor named Jim Buck wins AVN�s Gay Performer of the Year Award, and you better believe yr. corresps. sit bolt upright when the person who appears onstage to accept the award is a pink and leptosomatic 4'10" and is wearing an Eton collar and appears, even under 125X binoculation, to be a twelve-year-old boy. And it turns out it is a twelve-year-old boy: It�s Jim Buck�s little brother. �Jim can�t be here tonight because he�s performing in a Shakespeare festival in New Orleans,� the little boy says (correspondential expressions of bug-eyed inquiry at Hecuba and Filth�Shakespeare festival? sending a prepubescent relative to collect your excellence-in-filmed-sodomy prize?�are met with bemused shrugs), �but I�m here to thank you on his behalf, and to say that I taught Jim everything he knows.� [Enormous audience laugh and ovation, single spasmodic shudder from hunched ABC Radio lady.]  A strange and traumatic experience which one of yr. corrs. will not even try to describe consists of standing at a men�s room urinal between professional woodmen Alex Sanders and Dave Hardman. Suffice it to say that the urge to look over/down at their penises is powerful and the motives behind this urge so complex as to cause anuresis (which in turn ups the trauma). Be informed that male porn stars create around themselves the exact same opaque affective privacy- bubble that all men at urinals everywhere create. The whole Caesars Forum�s men�s room�s urinal area is an angst festival; take it from us. The sink-and-mirror-and-towelette area, however, turns out to be a priceless mash of Insider jargon and shoptalk, all made extra-resonant by echolalic tile and a surfeit of six-dollar drinks. One performer-turned-auteur is telling a colleague about an exciting new project:  �Found this Russian, this chick like nineteen, can�t speak a word of English, which for this [ = for the exciting project] is perfect.�  �You going to get in there? Just for maybe like one scene?�  �Nah. That�s the whole point. I�m the director. This is my package now.�  �Oh man though but you got to get in there. Just one scene. Nineteen, no English. Probably got a butthole about this big� [illustrative gesture unseen because auditor is still standing complexly traumatized at urinal].  �Well, we�ll see.� [Mutual laughter replete w/ warmth of genuine friendship, fellow-feeling; exeunt.]  The Awards Show�s planners have obviously studied at the Oscars� feet. Not only are the high-profile AVNAs held to the end�though with occasional teasers like Best Supporting thrown into the first two-thirds to keep people attentive52 �but the endless lists of categories and nominees are interspersed with little entr�actes of musical entertainment. Ms. Dyanna Lauren, for instance, appears between Best-Selling Tape and Best Foreign Release to sing her original composition �Psycho Magnet,� a hard-rock ballad about being a porn star and getting constantly stalked and harassed by mentally ill mooks. The song�s argumentation strikes yr. corresps. as a bit uneven, but Ms. Lauren struts and contorts and punctuates her phrasing with uppercuts to the air like a genuine MTV diva. The downside is that vocally, even with heavy amplification and digital synthesis, Dyanna Lauren sounds like a scalded cat, although Dick Filth points out that so does Alanis Morissette, and H. Hecuba chimes in by shouting: �Say whatever you want about the song-and-dance numbers here, they sure beat what Wahlberg and Reilly were coming up with in Boogie Nights!�  Hecuba�s claim seems unassailable until right before the Best Boxcover Concept category, when suddenly a piano is wheeled out for a chinless middle-aged man in the same sort of undersize porkpie that Art Carney always wore in The Honeymooners. This entertainer, who is introduced as �Doctor Dirty�the Dirtiest Musician in the History of Music,� proceeds to belt out obscene parodies of popular ditties that put Table 189 in mind of Mad magazine if everyone at Mad somehow all lost their mind at the same time. �Just got home from prison./My asshole is fizzin�./Goo goo goo drippin� out my back door� is the only snatch of actual lyrics that persists in memory, though titles like �Sit on a Happy Face� and �It�s a Small Dick After All� have proved maddeningly hard to forget. Nobody at or around our table has ever heard of Doctor Dirty before, but almost everyone agrees that he�s the �98 gala�s low point and a credible rival for Scotty Schwartz�s 1997 seminude rendition of �Thank Heaven for Little Girls� as the most repellent AVNA interlude in modern memory. There�s also the �98 ceremony�s climax, in which Midori53 and two other starlets take the stage as �the Spicy Girls� and do a rappish 4/4 number that ends with pretty much every female porn performer in the crowd54 up on stage dancing lasciviously and blowing kisses at the AVN cameras. This climactic distaff shindig apparently caps the Awards every year.  Something else happens every year. It�s never part of AVN�s videotape of the gala, but it�s a tradition that finally explains why the ballroom�s poor waiters are willing to spend five hours enduring beverage abuse and scuttling around to find change. After the Awards Show is over and the lights go up, some of the starlets always pose for obscene snapshots with the Forum�s waiters. A lot of this year�s picture-taking happens at the back, right near our table. One waiter stands with his arm around the shoulders of Leanna Hart, who pulls down the starboard side of her strapless taffeta and allows the waiter to cup her right breast while Table 189�s own personal waiter55 snaps the photo. Another waiter goes around behind Ms. Ann Amor�a very personable black lady with a 50-inch bust and gang tattoos all down both arms�and hunches over behind her as she bends forward and releases her breasts from confinement, and the waiter paws them and tries to look like he�s having intercourse with her from behind as his friend�s flash goes off. What the waiters are going to do with these photos is unguessable, but they�re visibly thrilled, and the starlets are patient and obliging with them in the same blank, distant way that they were with the mooks at the Adult CES.  Trying to leave after the AAVNAs gala is another slow process, because the broad hallway outside the ballroom is again filled with industry people with Caesar-cameo�d glasses they�ve somehow forgotten to leave at their tables, all standing in clumps and congratulating one another and making plans for various Insider parties later. But the slowest, scariest egressive part is traversing the long glass vestibule to the hotel�s side exit. A mass of fans and Caesars Palace custodians and assorted other civilians are there, and the crowd parts slightly to allow a narrow passage for the Awards� attendees, who must run this gauntlet nearly single file. It�s late, and everyone�s tired, and this crowd has none of the awestruck reticence of the cabstand�s spectators earlier. Now it�s like every mook has his own special high-volume comment for the passing stars, and there�s a weird mix of adulation and derision:  �Love you, Brittany!�  �How�d you get that dress on, baby?�  �Look over here!�  �Does your mother know where you�re at right now?�  One florid 30ish man holding a plastic cup of beer now reaches out from the crowd and very deliberately pinches the breast of the B-girl walking just in front of us. She slaps his hand away without breaking stride. Because we cannot see her face, we don�t know whether there is any reaction there at all. We have an informed guess, though.  Mr. Dick Filth is behind us with one hand on each of yr. corresps.� shoulders (we�re basically supporting him out). Everyone�s ears are still ringing, and Filth knows enough to almost shout:  �You know,� he says, �we�ve also got the XRCO Awards in February. X-Rated Critics Organization Awards�you get me? They�re not in Vegas, and they�re not rigged. And yet they manage to be just as ridiculous.�5Embed;

Ooh La La (from "The Smurfs 2");Britney Spears;pop; Three months ago, Cady Groves was on Rock Road in Wichita, driving down the main drag in a crappy Ford Taurus, when it suddenly hit her. She pulled over to get an ice cream cone at a Braum's store, hoping that would make her feel better, but it didn't.  As she started to cry while sitting alone in the parking lot, she grabbed her phone and called Rani Hancock, her A&R representative at RCA Records, whom she considered a dear friend. Groves told her that she couldn't do it anymore -- that is, be a part of RCA, the label she had dreamt of joining since she was a child. She wanted to be dropped.  The response she received was a heartfelt apology for her tumultuous stint on the label, but no concrete answers as to why it had happened. "They wanted me to know that this was in no way my fault, or due to my performance on anything," Groves tells Billboard. "I kept every promise, so why am I in a Kansas parking lot, afraid that my gas is gonna hit E? Why am I not good enough?"  Groves had moved to Wichita a year before that parking-lot epiphany, after spending the majority of the three prior years in Los Angeles, waiting for her phone to ring.  She had signed to RCA in 2010 and moved out to L.A. months later, but with bills to pay and no source of income, decided to move into a house that her brother had renovated in Kansas, and search for a 40-hour work week in late 2012.  The only stipulation: the job couldn't be somewhere that would risk her being recognized. "I almost got hired at a Starbucks," she says, "and I just couldn't do it, because everyone I know in this town goes to Starbucks, and the second they'd see me, they'd know I failed."  Groves, who is 24 years old, was once a prize courted by every major label. She has a collection of unique, expertly written pop songs; thousands of dedicated fans who appreciate her biting humor and Midwest sensibility; and a relentless work ethic that has beguiled some of the most celebrated producers and songwriters in modern pop music, including Savan Kotecha (One Direction's "What Makes You Beautiful," Britney Spears' "I Wanna Go") and Kristian Lundin (Backstreet Boys' "I Want It That Way," *N SYNC's "Bye Bye Bye").  "During our first session, both I and Savan [Kotecha] instantly felt she had a great, recognizable voice and personality," says Lundin, the Swedish legend who recently co-wrote One Direction's single "Kiss You." Lundin has not done much mainstream production work in the past decade, but for Groves, he willingly became a mentor. For those who discovered her, Groves' star potential was obvious and real.  But a few months ago, when she and her manager officially cut the cord with RCA after three years and one EP release, she was done with her recording career.  With the permission of her past collaborators, Groves started posting a steady stream of years-old demos online. They weren't demos of songs from her enthralling RCA debut album, because she had already resigned herself to never having that released commercially or even non-commercially; instead, they were outtakes, songs that she had roughly finished and enjoyed but were deemed not strong enough to make the full-length.  Scraps, the best she could offer for nearly 74,000 Twitter followers, several of whom have tweeted her, asking about the mysterious delay of her debut album. At that point, Groves didn't think she would ever make music again.  "I did the work, and that's what I don't understand," says Groves. "And when you don't get to see that payoff for the work you've done for years, it's really frustrating." After momentarily relinquishing her desire to become a pop star, Groves is back to believing in her abilities, and is looking for a new chance. Manager Stirling McIlwaine talks about meeting with new labels in the coming weeks, and repeats the phrase "Cady 2.0" when describing the next phase of the singer-songwriter's career.  She's nervous about diving back in, but is confident, even cocky, about what she can do. To get it right the second time, however, she still has to figure out what went wrong the first time.  ***  Growing up in Oklahoma cities like Marlow and Lawton after her parents divorced, Groves would turn on Christina Aguilera's "Genie In A Bottle" in her room and sing along from the inside of her closet, because she didn't want any of her family members hear her attempts to match the melismas.  One day, when her mother was outside cleaning the family's pool in the backyard, Cady marched outside and declared that she was going to be the next Britney Spears. Her mother responded, "No, you're not."  "I didn't want to be mean," says Groves' mother, Carol Petitt. "We all want as parents for our kids to have their heart's desires. But I didn't want to see hers crushed... you're gonna have to be able to provide for yourself. But she was tenacious."  Groves' childhood was largely unhappy. A rotating cast of stepfathers distanced her from her mother, and most of her older siblings -- Cady is the youngest of seven children -- told her that her voice was terrible, and that she shouldn't pursue music.  Wanting to become a songwriter but flirting with an interest in cooking, she graduated from high school at 16 and attended the Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts in Scottsdale, Ariz.; from there, she bundled up all of her possessions in a Ford Contour and bounced around the Southwest, residing in Phoenix, Nevada and Oklahoma at varying lengths of time, feeling lost in every city and state.  While staying in Oklahoma in the fall of 2007, Groves got a call from her favorite brother, Casey, inviting her to stay with him for a week at his house in Kansas. Groves, then 18, spent an incredible few days with her 28-year-old brother, watching "The Godfather" and eating miniature chocolates and going food shopping.  At the end of the week, she confessed that she still harbored the musical aspirations that she had had since she was little.  "He said, 'If you want to do something, you're wasting time right now talking about being scared to do it,'" Groves recalls. "He gave me confidence. We went out to eat that night, and we took a picture together, and I didn't know that that would be the last picture he ever took."  Two days later, Casey was dead -- the victim of a still-unresolved murder. Groves sank into a deep depression, spending most of her days locked in an apartment in Oklahoma, writing the bleakest songs of her life.  When she pulled herself out of that stupor six months later, Groves did so quickly -- leaving her apartment in the middle of the night, driving to Kansas City to live with her brother Kyle for the summer of 2008, and setting up a makeshift studio in his basement, where she could write lyrics and tinker with recording her vocals. Three months later, Cady went to live with another brother, Cody, back in Oklahoma, where she mowed lawns all day and worked on her MySpace page all night.  Eventually, Groves wrote a full EP of songs, titled "A Month of Sundays" -- and, still believing she couldn't sing, went onto Craigslist to find a vocalist who could prop up her words. She found a girl online who was willing to record her songs and used her lawn-mowing money to book some time at a studio in Springfield, Missouri� but the Craigslist girl never showed up.  "I felt like I had wasted so much money, and the [studio] bookers were like, 'You don't have a bad voice, just go sing the songs,'" she says. Groves did the best she could in the Missouri studio, traveled back to Oklahoma, and got sent the finished songs back in three weeks. "I posted the first one," says Groves, "and the next day, every major record label had contacted me on my MySpace."  Groves had reconnected with her family following Casey's death, but when her mother and brothers told her that the various label messages were hoaxes, she stopped communicating with them about her career.  Instead, she found a friend and backer in Hancock, the senior VP of A&R at RCA, who had worked with Clive Davis for over a decade at Arista and J Records, and been courting Groves to sign with the label while the burgeoning singer had been taking meetings in New York City [Hancock could not be reached for comment for this story].  Groves went with her gut, inked with Hancock and RCA in early spring 2010, and in May, embarked on her first national tour, on the 2010 Bamboozle Road Show alongside artists like Third Eye Blind, Good Charlotte and All Time Low.  "I've never seen someone stand in front of a crowd of people and be able to capture them so instantly," says guitarist Ryan Williams, who began playing shows with Groves in early 2011.  Everything was moving quickly for Groves when the Bamboozle trek wrapped in late June 2010: while her family was Googling her name to find out that her spot on a national tour wasn't a practical joke, Groves had moved to Los Angeles, determined to quickly write and record her first album.  Standing on the Santa Monica pier, Groves gazed out at the Pacific for the first time. "You look at the ocean, and you can't control anything out there -- it's so much bigger than all of us," she says. "It made me think, if I want to make an impact on the world... I have to have my songs be as big as this ocean to really move someone."  ***  The first songwriting attempts in Los Angeles were unsuccessful -- Groves says that she would send in songs and be told to keep writing, a polite rebuff of the material she had already written. Groves was soon paired with some of the biggest Swedish producers and songwriters in mainstream music to help extract her inner pop star: Kotecha, Carl Falk (Nicki Minaj's "Starships," One Direction's "Live While We're Young") and Lundin, the latter of whom she worked with most closely.  All the while, Groves was ecstatic, now writing with the collaborators of her childhood idols as an artist on the label of her childhood idols.  "I remember telling my mom, 'You don't understand -- when I was a kid, I had the Christina Aguilera single, and it said she was on RCA Records. And now my singles are gonna say that!'" says Groves. At 21, she also fell deeply in love with a collaborator, a 35-year-old producer she had met at one of her first writing sessions in Los Angeles, and began an intense, months-long relationship.  "We had talked about moving in together, and even getting married," she says. One day, the producer was running late to a writing session, and another producer at the studio casually mentioned that her secret boyfriend was married. After one final interaction in which Groves confronted the producer, the two never spoke again.  Feeling duped and heartbroken, Groves proceeded to re-write all of the songs she and the unnamed producer had worked on together. Groves and Lundin crafted an uptempo breakup single, "This Little Girl," that was at once darkly sardonic and addictive, punctuated by the line "This little girl is capable of murder/'Cause you hurt her." The song premiered in August 2011, and previewed the "This Little Girl" EP, released in February 2012.  Sam Lansky, TIME's deputy culture editor, heard Groves' debut EP at a Manhattan listening session in October 2011 while serving as a blogger for MuuMuse.com, and was unexpectedly intrigued. "I was really startled by how great the music was... and also, by her transparency and what a compelling figure she was," says Lansky. "It was a lot more than what you got from hearing 'This Little Girl' -- there was a depth to her and her story, and her willingness to share her story."  "This Little Girl" earned praise from pop blogs like PopCrush, JustJared and Idolator upon its release, but the EP was actually supposed to be an album. "I had a finished album, and I was going on tour with Hot Chelle Rae [in early 2012]� an EP is not the way I wanted to present these songs," says Groves.  According to the singer, however, RCA thought it would be better to release "This Little Girl" as a single on a four-song EP, and gauge interest before setting an album release date [RCA declined a request to comment for this story].  A year and a half after signing with the label, Groves was ready to put something, anything, out for the fans she had started gathering online and on tour, and begrudgingly backed the decision to release an EP led by her "This Little Girl" single.  But "This Little Girl" fizzled. Despite receiving a proper press push from RCA and a music video that featured a cameo from Blake Shelton, whom Groves met on Twitter, the song did not chart, and has sold only 89,000 downloads to date, according to Nielsen SoundScan.  The EP did even worse, selling only 3,000 copies to date. The Hot Chelle Rae tour came and went, and without a hit single to give her first major label project some momentum, Groves went back to waiting for word on her debut album.  "In pop, you have to come out of the gate swinging," says McIlwaine, who started working with Groves in late summer 2012 and also manages Daughtry and Kris Allen. "You have to have a song that cuts through and doesn't just barely get into the Top 40. You got to have some horsepower -- in today's world, you almost have to think about having a second single be successful after a first single does well, in order to release an album."  Groves was building a fan base on Twitter, passing the time by tweeting jokes that bordered on crude and that resulted in admonishments from her then-management. But she also had to shrug off questions about her album release, and started to slip back into depression.  After settling into Los Angeles upon signing with RCA, Groves became restless when her calls started going unanswered, and began bouncing around the country again -- returning to Oklahoma, then back to L.A., then in Nevada with her mother, before finally landing back in Kansas. "I had nothing to do all day," she says.  The glimmers of hope were few and far between in the two years after the "This Little Girl" debacle. Her next single, "Love Actually," was released nearly a year after "This Little Girl" in June 2012, but featured Groves' biggest chorus yet and another Lundin arrangement that revealed its details with repeated listens.  "Love Actually" was included on the track list to the "Now That's What I Call Music! 43" album, as one of four "Now What's Next" bonus tracks in August 2012, around the time she decided to change management. But without any radio play, the single was quickly dismissed; its current sales stand at 11,000 downloads, according to Nielsen SoundScan.  In early 2013, Groves was brought out to Los Angeles to shoot a music video for "Forget You," another new single that was more mature and evocative than "Love Actually."  Groves was told that "Forget You" was going to be included on RCA's upcoming soundtrack to "The Smurfs 2" and supported with a radio tour; although her optimism had been waning, the singer sensed that there was some enthusiasm for "Forget You" from the label.  Unfortunately, the "Smurfs 2" soundtrack, led by the little-played Britney Spears single "Ooh La La," has sold 14,000 copies since its release last July, according to Nielsen SoundScan. "I think it's fair to say that the 'Smurfs 2' soundtrack totally underperformed," says McIlwaine.  At that point, the writing was on the wall for Groves. The radio tour for "Forget You" had boiled down to a single performance, at a water park named Rock River Rapids in Derby, Kansas last July.  Four more months of inaction followed, with Groves describing a scene in which her management was feverishly pushing for a renewed radio tour for a single, "Forget You," that had already fulfilled its titular promise.  Out of options and patience, Groves called Hancock in a parking lot and begged to cut ties while choking back sobs. McIlwaine understood Groves' choice, and finalized her departure from RCA before the end of the year (the singer is still attached to RCA's parent company, Sony Music Entertainment, through her Sony/ATV publishing deal).  "I called up [RCA president/COO] Tom Corson," says McIlwaine, "and said, 'Hey, let's all be grown-ups here, and realize that this probably isn't going to become a priority for RCA, and that you guys just have too many big records coming out. Can Cady and I just go on our way and find her a new home?' And Tom was a total gentleman about it. He totally understood. He felt bad about it, but he was completely supportive of our decision to want to move on."  Of course, Groves didn't think she wanted to move on after such an experience; in mid-November, she told her manager that her career was over.  McIlwaine advised the singer to take the Thanksgiving and Christmas break to think about her future, and make sure her choice was final. Groves came back to him two days later with a changed mind. "I couldn't believe it when she said she was going to quit," says Petitt, her mother. "But her heart wasn't ready to stop."  ***  In October 2011, just months before Groves issued her only major label release to date, RCA Records folded J Records, Arista Records and Jive into one label. It was only natural for some of the roster's smaller artists, like Groves, to get somewhat lost in the shuffle during that time of on-the-fly transition.  But even some of the superstars on RCA -- including Miley Cyrus, Ke$ha and Miguel -- have had to endure periods of reinvention, often on different labels, to achieve their current feats of fame over the courses of their careers.  The phenomenon of the clumsily executed first encounter with major-label life isn't really a phenomenon at all.  "Having, and losing, a major label deal in your early 20s is practically a rite of passage for most of the big artists who have broken out over the last few years -- Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, Katy Perry," says Lansky. "It's sort of standard fare. And I do think that that level of stardom could be in Cady's future."  Groves doesn't know what will happen to the album she recorded during her first year as an RCA artist, but grimly believes that it will never see the light of day, even if she secures the rights from her former label.  "I know that everyone around me doesn't want me to use [the old album], because they want me to make a new album," she says.  And although those old songs sound slightly outdated, they also possess the blistering songwriting style that "This Little Girl" and "Love Actually" hinted at without fully embracing. Songs like "Red Handed," "Revenge" and "Same" are more polished than any of Groves' properly released singles, and a previously unheard enthusiasm for country music is flashed effortlessly in a majority of the tracks.  "The collection of songs represents Cady's own journey and expansion as a writer," says Lundin. "Her country roots initially gave way to her born-again love of pop (she had been a closeted pop-o-holic for years) but progressed back towards country, once enough pop was out of her system."  Groves hasn't made peace with the fact that her album might be gone for good, but she says she's happier than she has been in a long time. The singer did find a job out of the public eye in Wichita last August, at the Cocoa Dolce Artisan Chocolate shop, where she could utilize her culinary degree and make truffles for 40 hours a week in an unseen kitchen.  "There were like eight people [working] in there," says Groves, "and they were all interested in what I did, and we'd listen to my songs as we worked. Everyone who hears those songs, even strangers, gets excited for me."  Every day in Wichita, Groves runs errands, stops by the Starbucks she declined to work at, reads online articles and makes dinner. She goes to church every Sunday, watches HDTV and live-tweets new episodes of "Teen Mom." She has recently gone through a breakup, and has leaned on family and friends while remaining candid about her feelings with her fans on Twitter.  For Groves, social media remains a forum for both frank discussion about her past bouts of depression and an endless stream of Taco Bell jokes.  She's eager to write the next chapter of her music career with a new label home, but Groves hasn't written a new song in over a year. Groves admits that she's scared of losing them again, of losing more pieces of herself, in a way she still can't understand.  "There's a huge fear [of repeating the process]," she says. "But if I don't do this, what else am I good at? I don't want to do anything else. If I don't do this now, when I have an opportunity, I'll never do this again. If I end up sitting around for another four years, at least I'll be able to write and record a little bit longer. At least it's taking another step toward what I want instead of giving up. I'm trying again."Embed;

Nothin' on You (feat. Bruno Mars);B.o.B;pop; Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture  So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential "Yo! MTV Raps" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation  While rap has evolved, there�s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard�s Hot Rap Songs chart, we�re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally�s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered  100. "All of the Lights" - Kanye West 99. "No Lie" - 2 Chainz feat. Drake 98.

Glitter In the Air;P!nk;pop;Have you ever fed a lover with just your hands? Closed your eyes and trusted, just trusted? Have you ever thrown a fistful of glitter in the air? Have you ever looked fear in the face and said, "I just don't care"?   It's only half past the point of no return The tip of the iceberg, the sun before the burn The thunder before the lightning and the breath before the phrase Have you ever felt this way?   Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone? Your whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone Have you ever been touched so gently you had to cry?
