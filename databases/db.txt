That�s why I�ve drafted a will� Now I'd like Sounds Like to continue so I leave the registered rights to Pedro And I want Big J to finally get that sexy, designer trench coat And to Soul I leave my engraved piece of Jefferson Price�s bedpost And a really, really, really long collection of rhymes for Death Note Because I�m battling Shotty Horroh � yeah? The genius I mean it In Manchester, this guy is Jesus I am in utter shock, I'm giddy � in pieces Underprepared best man...I�m speechless They said, "Shotty�s back to battling, it�s just like the olden days." Couldn�t believe it �God�s back, huh? Holy shoulder blades� Well fuck it I�m back, too What�s up Premier Battles? You already know the dizzle Been underground, now Shuff's back in town, lock up your daughters; Josef Fritzl But this battle was meant to be last April, honestly He called it off� I�m like, "What? But mate, you promised me." I asked if it�s still happening, he�s like �Maybe. Possibly� I�ve been patiently waiting for this ancient prophesy Too pussy to actually face me properly He�s pissing himself worried that he�ll take a loss to me (colostomy) It�s taken you three prime ministers and a change of monarchy Do you understand how many lines I wrote that are now outdated due to your attitude? Do you understand how many Will Smith/Chris Rock punchlines I had to scrap for you?! And organizing an event and putting yourself as the headline is the worst mate It smacks of those kids who charged the other kids to come to their birthday We�re having this clash judged too, by performers he would have to know Because they rap for, YOUR platform � this sports arena that you own I can only imagine which way they all will see the battle go This is about as unbiased as Kim Jong Un in a North Korean Talent show I�ve also seen your battles though � I�ve got you figured out: 'Roids Simmer down, mate, you should be chilling out, poised Think about it all he has is a loud voice But your writing�s more of a shits how than Mrs. Brown�s Boys You hit mid-thirties and went up about six dress sizes You are a limping, groaning, knuckle-dragging midlife crisis I don�t care who�s most popular, I care about who�s the nicest You have a bigger name than me? So does fucking Isis Now, I preferred you when you were off the 'roids and thin But now he�s addicted to working out and it�s poisoned him You on social media is an extremely annoying thing My whole Twitter feed is you and Cojay just agreeing you enjoy the gym I want the stick person that we�ve seen, this version baffles me Wants to wrestle now? Well, I doubt we�ll see a big surge in casualties Such a fake guy he�ll only fake fight, he�ll inverse to atrophy Want to wrestle so bad? Go wrestle with your split personality I�m praying and I am hoping that by the end of this his head is fixed I�m talking to him, since it�s clear a therapist never did Cause you on social media is nuts I mean, you�ve got this anger that brews There�s different versions of him, these doppelg�ngers you use Someone says something you don�t like? He�s gotten mad in a mood Now, Shotty�s back in the room, you�re not the Adam we knew This constant angst is problematic, what�s the matter? Drop the act This rotten apple�s, gotten bad, he�s lost and tangled, shocking tact, you�re not a man you�re a youth That�s not what adults should do Acting like everyone�s against him, what an arrogant view Like you�re the center of attention? Your logic has to improve Not everybody�s a snake, a shocking fact, but it�s true When you fall out with everyone then the common factor is you You fuck up relationships the moment you activate a computer Turning friends you keep into enemies and those actions make you a user Think St. Patrick's Day, I banish snakes, I am the saint of the future I keep ahead (a head) of serpents like Perseus decapitating Medusa So don�t let his bullshit blur your vision Don�t be intimidated by a word he�s written Cause what he writes isn�t true like tabloid journalism So don�t be scared, most Horroh�s (horror) stories are a work of fiction [Round 2: Shotty Horroh] He's alright, isn't he? Probably someone with a case for the top 4 Not many can joke as good as him You normally know I'm goin' to win But today...you aren't sure That's fine Bastards He's a formidable opponent You're just livin' in the moment That graveyard's been nothin' but rusty chains and locked doors Until Brizzy said, "Look Shuffle over", well then I made space for one more The most, one dimensional rapper in the scene For the last ten years he's given us nothin' fresh Just copies Ricky Gervais' whole shit and makes it rhyme...I'm unimpressed I don't need to watch a Shuffle battle to tell you what could've happened, it's formulaic, I could've guessed Funny how you're called "Shuffle" when we always know what's comin' next I catch Shuffle while he teaches his little Rhyme & Rap Beginner classes Slidin' past the guy who asked for ticket passes With a knife that's stashed within my jacket Slicin', drive the jagged shiv I fashioned inside his ab, his liver's splashed Drive it back The skin is rugged like the shank it's gettin' traction You was battlin' bowls of fuckin' Fanta They kinda clash as mirror matches Cause you're both full of gas And the thumb and index is somethin' I can actually twist ya cap with Try me, try me, try me Act as if I'm chattin', don't die for rap cause it's in fashion They wanted Shuffle in the graveyard Now it's time for Michael Jackson 'Thriller' dances I heard, "Shuffle's outside" Let's get this Muppet outlined I don't give a fuck about rhymes I got this gun from 'round mines Me and my cousin, downsized It's just us and a brown ride [?] Foot in his house like, "Give it up or your pal dies." And Marlo stood there like, like, "I don't mean to trouble you now guys But I've got lunch at about 5:00 and another function around 9:00 I'm just worried about time Gun butt him Outlines Blood comin' out his mouth like you asked Gunna about slime Aim at Shuffle, and Shuffle outcries "Are you guys gonna fuckin' shoot me?!" {gun cocks} What does it sound like? And Marlo stood there...joke Fuck that! I'm outrageous If I don't impress Shuffle, I press Shuffle without playlist I'm the sensei What's a sensation to an out station Where would you have gotten without favors? Let's talk foundations There's a difference between rock bottom and ground breakers If I would've showed up today without patience, you'd be an outpatient Ahh Mortician, Shuffle on the table without Vegas I am thee, without a doubt greatest Out of town blazin', an ounce [?] You're just me, without flavor Downgraded, outdated Shotty, Tony, Soul, Kruger, Bizzo, Bobby, Unan', you're about 8ish Wait, that's without Arkaic, I can't downplay him Fuck Shuffle T! I've been talkin' smokin', Loud statements DJ with the drop on him, Shuffle on the floor like house ravers You rhyme words together really well That's why the people love you, but that's just one piece of the secret puzzle That's like missin' the sea cause you see the puddle That's where you seem to struggle You perform like your knees were buckled if you even push up a feeble muscle YOU let him do this with no conviction Just like if someone looks like him finds himself in legal trouble He stays insecure, stood on the spot lookin' like he needs a cuddle as he speaks so discrete and subtle That's why we don't believe in ya So many elite MC's that leagues above ya We don't in Shuffle like the deal's a hustle You get it, but that ain't the gamblin' part I told Briggzy we're gonna need a proper Shuffle or it's gonna damage the card You think pretending to not have an ego is the cheat code Like it's an invincible spell He thinks that if any MC is givin' him hell he just needs to giggle as well and it isn't an L All that nonchalant shit of you bein' the biggest you could be If you don't believe it, we don't believe it as well I mean all that self deprecating only made you be little (belittle) yourself Second round in, safe star bless Only one more round and plenty more space in that graveyard left [Round 2: Shuffle T]  {Shuffle pulls out his phone}  "Hey, yeah, um, can I speak to someone in HR? Yeah it's to deal with well-being and safeguards 2-9-1-5 is the number on my name card My place of work is Shotty Horroh�s Graveyard My complaints are - I never get told when a new shipment of bodies is coming in...which is a great start I just have to wait for them to magically pop up on my radar And I think he�s in denial cause, I know where the graves are And he always saying that he isn't, but he is running out of space fast If we ask too many questions he forces us out He turns up some days and orders us 'round He was meant to be in for a meeting at a quarter to...now Some are saying he won�t show up That�s what people are saying It's a hassle, it's a stress, it's havoc, it's a mess I just get batches of the dead turn up through National Express And if I ask how they died that�s a sackable offence Am I to believe that he...What? Rap battles them to death? I�m calling today cause I�ve just had someone through, Tali Another hopeless victim And I�m looking around and I�ve got no idea for the life of me where I�m s�posed to fit him Plot 3? No that�s taken. It�s taken it don�t need filling Well, I can put Tali in there but he�s going to have Tony with him I get that these things are best handled with stealth It�s just - it�s extra stress for me, which is bad for my health But I guess I�ve just got to deal with the hand I was dealt What was your name? Alright, Briggzy, well thanks for your help." Listen, I'm glad he's laughin', cause usually he's terrifying When he does smile, his Face ID doesn�t recognize him That, and you've put on a [?] amount of weight A bit of padding around the face You're the man of the house, it's great I bet your calorie count's insane But I'm not intimidated by you, that wasn't how I was raised I don't feel fear next to you, I just feel massively out of shape Now, he DID beat me in that film VS � but it was hard for me to lose that Cause I first wrote my side of the battle they said, �We can�t really use that It needs to be WORSE than Shotty�s material, so can you write us a new rap?� I said, �WORSE than Shotty�s stuff�? I don�t know if I can do that.� In the end I had to go through about 100,000 scripts To make my stuff as bad as what�s coming out that fucking mouth of his At one point I just screwed up a piece of paper and rubbed it 'round in shit The director said, �I think we�ll need to dumb it down a bit.� I was in 8 Mile as well, you seen it? Ahh, it's genius as fuck Producer called me personally said, �We need you for this, Shuff� I was meant to lose to Eminem, but the scenes have all been cut Apparently, me getting beat wasn�t �believable enough� Now listen, me and funny go together like bees and honey Easy money, Heretic and a vegan curry But it�s an understatement if you're describing me as �hungry� That�s like calling Ian Huntley a �cheeky monkey� I feel so comfy up here, I�m winning this in every round I should be getting out my armchair, slippers and a dressing gown You should bring Briggzy in as well, man! Fuck it, just for a laugh We can turn this in to a 1v1 and a half Cause look at all the people that you have to bring with you The second that a battle�s not inside of the M62 I could�ve had this battle in your house in your parent�s living room And have them both arguing over who they�d give it to Your mom gives it to me So, if I were you, I would honestly hide in a safe space Because this could cost you your life and that is fucking mate�s rates I am in here to have a couple of quick beers and slay I don�t care if the Sharks or the Knights are the ones that win here today Don�t get that misconstrued, I mean MY win�s clear on stage I just don�t care about the teams, cause I�m not 6 years of age Every performance I have out of 10 I give myself a million I am my own worst critic and I think I�m fucking brilliant! So fuck it, the round's done, I got his back to the turnbuckle Let�s all see how many puns this cunt has for the word �shuffle� Time  [Round 3: Shotty Horroh] I mean Shuffle T's funny as fuck I've been quotin' him when he's roastin' them As far as the stand up comedy rap battle fans go, it's either O'shea or him to be the GOAT for them But there's this Joe Pesci notion... Funny how? If you focusin' Cause there's two types of funny in this world bro and you're both of 'em Cause you're funny, like you're funny when they're lovin' your clowin' But you're funny like there's really somethin' funny about him Cause I don't fuck my friends over You get bad luck from it Pussy try bein' a stand up guy before you try bein' a stand up comic Cause no matter what Cruger and Bags do for this lad, you know he's team Rowan forever He literally robbed your friends of their business pursuit as he DM'd you, you instantly fold to the pressure He's payin' you with the money that he owes to them...don't act like you didn't know any better Crazy that you made a paperback when you was the staple that didn't have the spine to hold it together He does not give a fuck I've never met anybody as bold as he is Can you imagine him, Cruger and Bagnall on Zoom if they host a meetin' for the Sound Like show that evenin'? And he's tangent off to Don't Flop, the whole case, the whole proceedings He sat there like, "What a cunt. What a cunt. Sorry guys that's my phone. Hello Roooooo- Hello Ronan Keating Boys I have Ronan Keating." He does not give a fuck, you have to understand That shit he did with Liam and Freddie, that shit made 'em sick, they ain't just anybodys Without them, I don't think the scene you see today exists I'm not saying you're a piece of shit cause you didn't hold it down I'm just sayin', you ain't legit Cause he tried doin' the same shit to my brother, and we squaded up and created this Loyal to the soil I don't fuck with anybody that wants to play with Briggz You don't like him, I don't you, simple, plain as shit That's why our careers meet at a fork in the road, and they separate, like this Cause you're still maintainin' a main event career and gettin' a wage from it And I'm the guy that pays you it And I did your little panel show for free twice It was COVID times I let the love persuade me You couldn't sell tickets, make money, there was no crowd, stuff was crazy You came at me with the whole "we're friends" angle and I [?] Cause me charging Shuffle shady Until we needed you during the pandemic and your attitude was "fuck you pay me" So fuck Shuffle T and his book and his infiltrating, gentrification in a class These posh cunts can't see what the streets created with the scraps And wanna turn it into data and a [?] "Click this link and learn how to be hip hop" FUCK OFF! We ain't got the patience for all a dat For your book to be useful to me, I'd have to tape it to my abs so I was safe from gettin' stabbed I didn't learn this shift from a fuckin' book I was battlin' on the street corner since I had a bus pass and pocket full of dust caps People hated, FUCK THAT I handled the positive and the negative like a blood bank Me versus you, 1 on 1 ain't a good match Cause I've always been a couple points above you like a umlaut Next thing I wanna talk about is very fuckin' serious It's not a joke Cause I don't trust a man who's arms don't move when he walks It's one of those Why do your arms look so heavy bro? I gotta know You look like every single [?] trying to carry your mum's worth of shopping home Fuckin' strange guy Lookin' like the little Men In Black alien inside him can't operate the arms and the legs at the same time And thank you very much Another straight, white, male with a podcast With long hair and edgy jokes It's fuckin' Russel off-Brand  That's me, thank you  [Round 3: Shuffle T] Now your music has actually been a little different lately When you up and switch so fucking quick it comes across as shady That Scum Of The Earth album was so Oasis influenced it was crazy I said, �Do you think you might have ripped them off a bit?� He said �mayyyyyybeeeeeeee!" I said, �Yeah, Definitely Maybe Here�s what I think happened, I think you started copying them 'Little By Little' Then you just 'Roll With It' Head up in the clouds I mean he doesn�t hear it It makes him wonder what all ('Wonderwall') the fuss is about No one�s more pissed off than me, I liked how your old albums sound In fact, I don�t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now 'Don't Look Back In Anger' You blended Brit pop and hip hop with rock Thought it would be shit hot, big shock, it�s not You ripped off a band you like, and yeah you did it beautifully But musically, now you�re nowhere near as good as it used to be Cause when you sell out your art for a dime It�ll never be far from your mind Cause when you�ve been cast to the side those steps are a bastard to climb You�re energy starved and you�ll try, but never regrasp on those heights Your penmanship starts to decline, your presence your bars and your lines And everything�s harder to rhyme Integrity�s hard to define But when you pretend to be part of a life Of the celebrity�s art that you like All you�re doing is karaoke, you dress up you dance and you mime So, all you�ve actually done is perfected the art of disguise That�s why you�re running out of smoke like a contestant on Stars In Their Eyes Tonight Matthew, I�m going to shove Noel�s Gallagher�s dick in every hole that it can fit The only role that you can give, this ain�t a cold slap on the wrist You�re facing the whole character list of Soul Caliber 6 That�s why he�s saying shit lines these days like "It Tali and (Italian) blood run in the streets", oh my God, you're such a prick The Manny crowd were loving it, most people wouldn�t fuck with it I was just watching with a confused face, I couldn�t keep up with it Not because it's too complex, just cause it's fucking shit "Italian blood running the streets" � I�ll slow down I�m out maneuvering I'm gettin' a bit too complex so let me do some tutoring See I said something about the mafia, but I included in his pseudonym I don�t give a shit if you crammed his name in there it still has fuck all to do with him Let me say something simple and make it official Battle rap bars aren't personal cause their name or initial was placed in the middle Every round from you these days is just this crazy horrid scheme You make it sound complex but it�s always just the same obnoxious theme People used to be able to battle in a way they�d want to speak Whatever happened to just fucking saying what you mean? Every line it�s �I said one thing that sounds like another thing. Isn't that clever?� I�m just watching from the side like �Mate. It isn�t that clever.� So, I won�t dress this up with word play I�ll just tell you what the truth is I think insecurity is the reason you became a unit Your battles aren�t that great these days, neither is your music I think you�re overrated, and I think you�re fuckin' stupid This is loud-mouth bullshit versus strong and silent You make something simple feel like rocket science I make rocket science feel like comic timing Like Hugh Laurie, The Two Ronnies or Monty Python It doesn�t make an ounce of difference how you spin it Which way round you flip it, upside down and twisted I am bound to win this, and the crowd can witness This counterfeited coward�s limits There�s always praise for you and you�re showered with it Put on a pedestal like some proud exhibit They put you in the top 4 they�ve mapped out your image Well, you can have Mount Rushmore I�ll take Mount Olympus You say I�m a clown as if it means that I�m annoyed I love that reputation, that's my pride and joy So, go find some 'roids, alright? Enjoy! Take that belt to its biting point I�ll just kick you in the bollocks with my clown shoes so hard you�ll have a higher voice than a choirboy�s! If you�re watching from overseas � watch more UK battle rap Watch Frankie, Frost, Oshea, Cojay, Gemini, It�s action packed Watch Premier Battles, Don't Flop, No Loose Chat, fuck it - watch some Danny Jaqq Just stop giving all your attention to this overrated fuckin' twat! See, I beat you with word play, angles, aggression, concepts, this battle�s what I make it You just forever rely on Americanized generically rhymed name flips You�re an imitator � you see what�s out there and you claim it I�m an innovator � I see what�s out there and I change it TimeEmbed;

Once in a Lifetime - 2005 Remaster;Talking Heads;rock;Missing Data Sponsors get the answer they want   Before we get going, we need to establish one thing beyond any doubt: industry-funded trials are more likely to produce a positive, flattering result than independently-funded trials. This is our core premise, and you�re about to read a very short chapter, because this is one of the most well-documented phenomena in the growing field of �research about research�. It has also become much easier to study in recent years, because the rules on declaring industry funding have become a little clearer.  We can begin with some recent work: in 2010, three researchers from Harvard and Toronto found all the trials looking at five major classes of drug � antidepressants, ulcer drugs and so on � then measured two key features: were they positive, and were they funded by industry?1 They found over five hundred trials in total: 85 per cent of the industry-funded studies were positive, but only 50 per cent of the government-funded trials were. That�s a very significant difference.  In 2007, researchers looked at every published trial that set out to explore the benefit of a statin.2 These are cholesterol-lowering drugs which reduce your risk of having a heart attack, they are prescribed in very large quantities, and they will loom large in this book. This study found 192 trials in total, either comparing one statin against another, or comparing a statin against a different kind of treatment. Once the researchers controlled for other factors (we�ll delve into what this means later), they found that industry-funded trials were twenty times more likely to give results favouring the test drug. Again, that�s a very big difference.  We�ll do one more. In 2006, researchers looked into every trial of psychiatric drugs in four academic journals over a ten-year period, finding 542 trial outcomes in total. Industry sponsors got favourable outcomes for their own drug 78 per cent of the time, while independently-funded trials only gave a positive result in 48 per cent of cases. If you were a competing drug put up against the sponsor�s drug in a trial, you were in for a pretty rough ride: you would only win a measly 28 per cent of the time.3  These are dismal, frightening results, but they come from individual studies. When there has been lots of research in a field, it�s always possible that someone � like me, for example � could cherry-pick the results, and give a partial view. I could, in essence, be doing exactly what I accuse the pharmaceutical industry of doing, and only telling you about the studies that support my case, while hiding the reassuring ones from you.  To guard against this risk, researchers invented the systematic review. We�ll explore this in more detail soon (p.14), since it�s at the core of modern medicine, but in essence a systematic review is simple: instead of just mooching through the research literature, consciously or unconsciously picking out papers here and there that support your pre-existing beliefs, you take a scientific, systematic approach to the very process of looking for scientific evidence, ensuring that your evidence is as complete and representative as possible of all the research that has ever been done.  Systematic reviews are very, very onerous. In 2003, by coincidence, two were published, both looking specifically at the question we�re interested in. They took all the studies ever published that looked at whether industry funding is associated with pro-industry results. Each took a slightly different approach to finding research papers, and both found that industry-funded trials were, overall, about four times more likely to report positive results.4 A further review in 2007 looked at the new studies that had been published in the four years after these two earlier reviews: it found twenty more pieces of work, and all but two showed that industry-sponsored trials were more likely to report flattering results.5  I am setting out this evidence at length because I want to be absolutely clear that there is no doubt on the issue. Industry-sponsored trials give favourable results, and that is not my opinion, or a hunch from the occasional passing study. This is a very well-documented problem, and it has been researched extensively, without anybody stepping out to take effective action, as we shall see.  There is one last study I�d like to tell you about. It turns out that this pattern of industry-funded trials being vastly more likely to give positive results persists even when you move away from published academic papers, and look instead at trial reports from academic conferences, where data often appears for the first time (in fact, as we shall see, sometimes trial results only appear at an academic conference, with very little information on how the study was conducted).  Fries and Krishnan studied all the research abstracts presented at the 2001 American College of Rheumatology meetings which reported any kind of trial, and acknowledged industry sponsorship, in order to find out what proportion had results that favoured the sponsor�s drug. There is a small punch-line coming, and to understand it we need to cover a little of what an academic paper looks like. In general, the results section is extensive: the raw numbers are given for each outcome, and for each possible causal factor, but not just as raw figures. The �ranges� are given, subgroups are perhaps explored, statistical tests are conducted, and each detail of the result is described in table form, and in shorter narrative form in the text, explaining the most important results. This lengthy process is usually spread over several pages. In Fries and Krishnan [2004] this level of detail was unnecessary. The results section is a single, simple, and � I like to imagine � fairly passive-aggressive sentence:  The results from every RCT (45 out of 45) favored the drug of the sponsor.  This extreme finding has a very interesting side effect, for those interested in time-saving shortcuts. Since every industry-sponsored trial had a positive result, that�s all you�d need to know about a piece of work to predict its outcome: if it was funded by industry, you could know with absolute certainty that the trial found the drug was great.  How does this happen? How do industry-sponsored trials almost always manage to get a positive result? It is, as far as anyone can be certain, a combination of factors. It may be that companies are more likely to run trials when they�re more confident their treatment is going to �win�; this sounds reasonable, although even this conflicts with the ethical principle that you should only do a trial when there�s genuine uncertainty about which treatment is best (otherwise you�re exposing half of your participants to a treatment you already know to be inferior). Sometimes the chances of one treatment winning can be increased with outright design flaws. You can compare your new drug with something you know to be rubbish � an existing drug at an inadequate dose, perhaps, or a placebo sugar pill that does almost nothing. You can choose your patients very carefully, so they are more likely to get better on your treatment. You can peek at the results halfway through, and stop your trial early if they look good (which is � for interesting reasons we shall discuss � statistical poison). And so on.  But before we get to these fascinating methodological twists and quirks, these nudges and bumps that stop a trial from being a fair test of whether a treatment works or not, there is something very much simpler at hand.  Sometimes drug companies conduct lots of trials, and when they see that the results are unflattering, they simply fail to publish them. This is not a new problem, and it�s not limited to medicine. In fact, this issue of negative results that go missing in action cuts into almost every corner of science. It distorts findings in fields as diverse as brain imaging and economics, it makes a mockery of all our efforts to exclude bias from our studies, and despite everything that regulators, drug companies and even some academics will tell you, it is a problem that has been left unfixed for decades.  In fact, it is so deep-rooted that even if we fixed it today � right now, for good, forever, without any flaws or loopholes in our legislation � that still wouldn�t help, because we would still be practising medicine, cheerfully making decisions about which treatment is best, on the basis of decades of medical evidence which is � as you�ve now seen � fundamentally distorted.  But there is a way ahead.  Why missing data matters  Reboxetine is a drug I myself have prescribed. Other drugs had done nothing for this particular patient, so we wanted to try something new. I�d read the trial data before I wrote the prescription, and found only well-designed, fair tests, with overwhelmingly positive results. Reboxetine was better than placebo, and as good as any other antidepressant in head-to-head comparisons. It�s approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the MHRA), which governs all drugs in the UK. Millions of doses are prescribed every year, around the world. Reboxetine was clearly a safe and effective treatment. The patient and I discussed the evidence briefly, and agreed it was the right treatment to try next. I signed a piece of paper, a prescription, saying I wanted my patient to have this drug.  But we had both been misled. In October 2010 a group of researchers were finally able to bring together all the trials that had ever been conducted on reboxetine.6 Through a long process of investigation � searching in academic journals, but also arduously requesting data from the manufacturers and gathering documents from regulators � they were able to assemble all the data, both from trials that were published, and from those that had never appeared in academic papers.  When all this trial data was put together it produced a shocking picture. Seven trials had been conducted comparing reboxetine against placebo. Only one, conducted in 254 patients, had a neat, positive result, and that one was published in an academic journal, for doctors and researchers to read. But six more trials were conducted, in almost ten times as many patients. All of them showed that reboxetine was no better than a dummy sugar pill. None of these trials was published. I had no idea they existed.  It got worse. The trials comparing reboxetine against other drugs showed exactly the same picture: three small studies, 507 patients in total, showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other drug. They were all published. But 1,657 patients� worth of data was left unpublished, and this unpublished data showed that patients on reboxetine did worse than those on other drugs. If all this wasn�t bad enough, there was also the side-effects data. The drug looked fine in the trials which appeared in the academic literature: but when we saw the unpublished studies, it turned out that patients were more likely to have side effects, more likely to drop out of taking the drug, and more likely to withdraw from the trial because of side effects, if they were taking reboxetine rather than one of its competitors. If you�re ever in any doubt about whether the stories in this book make me angry � and I promise you, whatever happens, I will keep to the data, and strive to give a fair picture of everything we know � you need only look at this story. I did everything a doctor is supposed to do. I read all the papers, I critically appraised them, I understood them, I discussed them with the patient, and we made a decision together, based on the evidence. In the published data, reboxetine was a safe and effective drug. In reality, it was no better than a sugar pill, and worse, it does more harm than good. As a doctor I did something which, on the balance of all the evidence, harmed my patient, simply because unflattering data was left unpublished.  If you find that amazing, or outrageous, your journey is just beginning. Because nobody broke any law in that situation, reboxetine is still on the market, and the system that allowed all this to happen is still in play, for all drugs, in all countries in the world. Negative data goes missing, for all treatments, in all areas of science. The regulators and professional bodies we would reasonably expect to stamp out such practices have failed us.  In a few pages, we will walk through the literature that demonstrates all of this beyond any doubt, showing that �publication bias� � the process whereby negative results go unpublished � is endemic throughout the whole of medicine and academia; and that regulators have failed to do anything about it, despite decades of data showing the size of the problem. But before we get to that research, I need you to feel its implications, so we need to think about why missing data matters.  Evidence is the only way we can possibly know if something works � or doesn�t work � in medicine. We proceed by testing things, as cautiously as we can, in head-to-head trials, and gathering together all of the evidence. This last step is crucial: if I withhold half the data from you, it�s very easy for me to convince you of something that isn�t true. If I toss a coin a hundred times, for example, but only tell you about the results when it lands heads-up, I can convince you that this is a two-headed coin. But that doesn�t mean I really do have a two-headed coin: it means I�m misleading you, and you�re a fool for letting me get away with it. This is exactly the situation we tolerate in medicine, and always have. Researchers are free to do as many trials as they wish, and then choose which ones to publish.  The repercussions of this go way beyond simply misleading doctors about the benefits and harms of interventions for patients, and way beyond trials. Medical research isn�t an abstract academic pursuit: it�s about people, so every time we fail to publish a piece of research we expose real, living people to unnecessary, avoidable suffering.  TGN1412  In March 2006, six volunteers arrived at a London hospital to take place in a trial. It was the first time a new drug called TGN1412 had ever been given to humans, and they were paid �2,000 each.7 Within an hour these six men developed headaches, muscle aches, and a feeling of unease. Then things got worse: high temperatures, restlessness, periods of forgetting who and where they were. Soon they were shivering, flushed, their pulses racing, their blood pressure falling. Then, a cliff: one went into respiratory failure, the oxygen levels in his blood falling rapidly as his lungs filled with fluid. Nobody knew why. Another dropped his blood pressure to just 65/40, stopped breathing properly, and was rushed to an intensive care unit, knocked out, intubated, mechanically ventilated. Within a day all six were disastrously unwell: fluid on their lungs, struggling to breathe, their kidneys failing, their blood clotting uncontrollably throughout their bodies, and their white blood cells disappearing. Doctors threw everything they could at them: steroids, antihistamines, immune-system receptor blockers. All six were ventilated on intensive care. They stopped producing urine; they were all put on dialysis; their blood was replaced, first slowly, then rapidly; they needed plasma, red cells, platelets. The fevers continued. One developed pneumonia. And then the blood stopped getting to their peripheries. Their fingers and toes went flushed, then brown, then black, and then began to rot and die. With heroic effort, all escaped, at least, with their lives.  The Department of Health convened an Expert Scientific Group to try to understand what had happened, and from this two concerns were raised.8 Firstly: can we stop things like this from happening again? It�s plainly foolish, for example, to give a new experimental treatment to all six participants in a �first-in-man� trial at the same time, if that treatment is a completely unknown quantity. New drugs should be given to participants in a staggered process, slowly, over a day. This idea received considerable attention from regulators and the media.  Less noted was a second concern: could we have foreseen this disaster? TGN1412 is a molecule that attaches to a receptor called CD28 on the white blood cells of the immune system. It was a new and experimental treatment, and it interfered with the immune system in ways that are poorly understood, and hard to model in animals (unlike, say, blood pressure, because immune systems are very variable between different species). But as the final report found, there was experience with a similar intervention: it had simply not been published. One researcher presented the inquiry with unpublished data on a study he had conducted in a single human subject a full ten years earlier, using an antibody that attached to the CD3, CD2 and CD28 receptors. The effects of this antibody had parallels with those of TGN1412, and the subject on whom it was tested had become unwell. But nobody could possibly have known that, because these results were never shared with the scientific community. They sat unpublished, unknown, when they could have helped save six men from a terrifying, destructive, avoidable ordeal.  That original researcher could not foresee the specific harm he contributed to, and it�s hard to blame him as an individual, because he operated in an academic culture where leaving data unpublished was regarded as completely normal. The same culture exists today. The final report on TGN1412 concluded that sharing the results of all first-in-man studies was essential: they should be published, every last one, as a matter of routine. But phase 1 trial results weren�t published then, and they�re still not published now. In 2009, for the first time, a study was published looking specifically at how many of these first-in-man trials get published, and how many remain hidden.9 They took all such trials approved by one ethics committee over a year. After four years, nine out of ten remain unpublished; after eight years, four out of five were still unpublished.  In medicine, as we shall see time and again, research is not abstract: it relates directly to life, death, suffering and pain. With every one of these unpublished studies we are potentially exposed, quite unnecessarily, to another TGN1412. Even a huge international news story, with horrific images of young men brandishing blackened feet and hands from hospital beds, wasn�t enough to get movement, because the issue of missing data is too complicated to fit in one sentence.  When we don�t share the results of basic research, such as a small first-in-man study, we expose people to unnecessary risks in the future. Was this an extreme case? Is the problem limited to early, experimental, new drugs, in small groups of trial participants? No.  In the 1980s, doctors began giving anti-arrhythmic drugs to all patients who�d had a heart attack. This practice made perfect sense on paper: we knew that anti-arrhythmic drugs helped prevent abnormal heart rhythms; we also knew that people who�ve had a heart attack are quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms; we also knew that often these went unnoticed, undiagnosed and untreated. Giving anti-arrhythmic drugs to everyone who�d had a heart attack was a simple, sensible, preventive measure. Unfortunately, it turned out that we were wrong. This prescribing practice, with the best of intentions, on the best of principles, actually killed people. And because heart attacks are very common, it killed them in very large numbers: well over 100,000 people died unnecessarily before it was realised that the fine balance between benefit and risk was completely different for patients without a proven abnormal heart rhythm.  Could anyone have predicted this? Sadly, yes, they could have. A trial in 1980 tested a new anti-arrhythmic drug, lorcainide, in a small number of men who�d had a heart attack � less than a hundred � to see if it was any use. Nine out of forty-eight men on lorcainide died, compared with one out of forty-seven on placebo. The drug was early in its development cycle, and not long after this study it was dropped for commercial reasons. Because it wasn�t on the market, nobody even thought to publish the trial. The researchers assumed it was an idiosyncrasy of their molecule, and gave it no further thought. If they had published, we would have been much more cautious about trying other anti-arrhythmic drugs on people with heart attacks, and the phenomenal death toll � over 100,000 people in their graves prematurely � might have been stopped sooner. More than a decade later, the researchers finally did publish their results, with a mea culpa, recognising the harm they had done by not sharing them earlier:  When we carried out our study in 1980, we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance. The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons, and this study was therefore never published; it is now a good example of �publication bias�. The results described here might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead.10  As we shall shortly see, this problem of unpublished data is widespread throughout medicine, and indeed the whole of academia, even though the scale of the problem, and the harm it causes, have been documented beyond any doubt. We will see stories on basic cancer research, Tamiflu, cholesterol blockbusters, obesity drugs, antidepressants and more, with evidence that goes from the dawn of medicine to the present day, and data that is still being withheld, right now, as I write, on widely used drugs which many of you reading this book will have taken this morning. We will also see how regulators and academic bodies have repeatedly failed to address the problem.  Because researchers are free to bury any result they please, patients are exposed to harm on a staggering scale throughout the whole of medicine, from research to practice. Doctors can have no idea about the true effects of the treatments they give. Does this drug really work best, or have I simply been deprived of half the data? Nobody can tell. Is this expensive drug worth the money, or have the data simply been massaged? No one can tell. Will this drug kill patients? Is there any evidence that it�s dangerous? No one can tell.  This is a bizarre situation to arise in medicine, a discipline where everything is supposed to be based on evidence, and where everyday practice is bound up in medico-legal anxiety. In one of the most regulated corners of human conduct we�ve taken our eyes off the ball, and allowed the evidence driving practice to be polluted and distorted. It seems unimaginable. We will now see how deep this problem goes.  Why we summarise data  Missing data has been studied extensively in medicine. But before I lay out that evidence, we need to understand exactly why it matters, from a scientific perspective. And for that we need to understand systematic reviews and �meta-analysis�. Between them, these are two of the most powerful ideas in modern medicine. They are incredibly simple, but they were invented shockingly late.  When we want to find out if something works or not, we do a trial. This is a very simple process, and the first recorded attempt at some kind of trial was in the Bible (Daniel 1:12, if you�re interested). Firstly, you need an unanswered question: for example, �Does giving steroids to a woman delivering a premature baby increase the chances of that baby surviving?� Then you find some relevant participants, in this case, mothers about to deliver a premature baby. You�ll need a reasonable number of them, let�s say two hundred for this trial. Then you divide them into two groups at random, give the mothers in one group the current best treatment (whatever that is in your town), while the mothers in the other group get current best treatment plus some steroids. Finally, when all two hundred women have gone through your trial, you count up how many babies survived in each group.  This is a real-world question, and lots of trials were done on this topic, starting from 1972 onwards: two trials showed that steroids saved lives, but five showed no significant benefit. Now, you will often hear that doctors disagree when the evidence is mixed, and this is exactly that kind of situation. A doctor with a strong pre-existing belief that steroids work � perhaps preoccupied with some theoretical molecular mechanism, by which the drug might do something useful in the body � could come along and say: �Look at these two positive trials! Of course we must give steroids!� A doctor with a strong prior intuition that steroids were rubbish might point at the five negative trials and say: �Overall the evidence shows no benefit. Why take a risk?�  Up until very recently, this was basically how medicine progressed. People would write long, languorous review articles � essays surveying the literature � in which they would cite the trial data they�d come across in a completely unsystematic fashion, often reflecting their own prejudices and values. Then, in the 1980s, people began to do something called a �systematic review�. This is a clear, systematic survey of the literature, with the intention of getting all the trial data you can possibly find on one topic, without being biased towards any particular set of findings. In a systematic review, you describe exactly how you looked for data: which databases you searched, which search engines and indexes you used, even what words you searched for. You pre-specify the kinds of studies that can be included in your review, and then you present everything you�ve found, including the papers you rejected, with an explanation of why. By doing this, you ensure that your methods are fully transparent, replicable and open to criticism, providing the reader with a clear and complete picture of the evidence. It may sound like a simple idea, but systematic reviews are extremely rare outside clinical medicine, and are quietly one of the most important and transgressive ideas of the past forty years.  When you�ve got all the trial data in one place, you can conduct something called a meta-analysis, where you bring all the results together in one giant spreadsheet, pool all the data and get one single, summary figure, the most accurate summary of all the data on one clinical question. The output of this is called a �blobbogram�, and you can see one on the opposite page, in the logo of the Cochrane Collaboration, a global, non-profit academic organisation that has been producing gold-standard reviews of evidence on important questions in medicine since the 1980s.  This blobbogram shows the results of all the trials done on giving steroids to help premature babies survive. Each horizontal line is a trial: if that line is further to the left, then the trial showed steroids were beneficial and saved lives. The central, vertical line is the �line of no effect�: and if the horizontal line of the trial touches the line of no effect, then that trial showed no statistically significant benefit. Some trials are represented by longer horizontal lines: these were smaller trials, with fewer participants, which means they are prone to more error, so the estimate of the benefit has more uncertainty, and therefore the horizontal line is longer. Finally, the diamond at the bottom shows the �summary effect�: this is the overall benefit of the intervention, pooling together the results of all the individual trials. These are much narrower than the lines for individual trials, because the estimate is much more accurate: it is summarising the effect of the drug in many more patients. On this blobbogram you can see � because the diamond is a long way from the line of no effect � that giving steroids is hugely beneficial. In fact, it reduces the chances of a premature baby dying by almost half.  The amazing thing about this blobbogram is that it had to be invented, and this happened very late in medicine�s history. For many years we had all the information we needed to know that steroids saved lives, but nobody knew they were effective, because nobody did a systematic review until 1989. As a result, the treatment wasn�t given widely, and huge numbers of babies died unnecessarily; not because we didn�t have the information, but simply because we didn�t synthesise it together properly.  In case you think this is an isolated case, it�s worth examining exactly how broken medicine was until frighteningly recent times. The diagram on the opposite page contains two blobbograms, or �forest plots�, showing all the trials ever conducted to see whether giving streptokinase, a clot-busting drug, improves survival in patients who have had a heart attack.11  Look first only at the forest plot on the left. This is a conventional forest plot, from an academic journal, so it�s a little busier than the stylised one in the Cochrane logo. The principles, however, are exactly the same. Each horizontal line is a trial, and you can see that there is a hodgepodge of results, with some trials showing a benefit (they don�t touch the vertical line of no effect, headed �1�) and some showing no benefit (they do cross that line). At the bottom, however, you can see the summary effect � a dot on this old-fashioned blobbogram, rather than a diamond. And you can see very clearly that overall, streptokinase saves lives.  So what�s that on the right? It�s something called a cumulative meta-analysis. If you look at the list of studies on the left of the diagram, you can see that they are arranged in order of date. The cumulative meta-analysis on the right adds in each new trial�s results, as they arrived over history, to the previous trials� results. This gives the best possible running estimate, each year, of how the evidence would have looked at that time, if anyone had bothered to do a meta-analysis on all the data available to them. From this cumulative blobbogram you can see that the horizontal lines, the �summary effects�, narrow over time as more and more data is collected, and the estimate of the overall benefit of this treatment becomes more accurate. You can also see that these horizontal lines stopped touching the vertical line of no effect a very long time ago � and crucially, they do so a long time before we started giving streptokinase to everyone with a heart attack.  In case you haven�t spotted it for yourself already � to be fair, the entire medical profession was slow to catch on � this chart has devastating implications. Heart attacks are an incredibly common cause of death. We had a treatment that worked, and we had all the information we needed to know that it worked, but once again we didn�t bring it together systematically to get that correct answer. Half of the people in those trials at the bottom of the blobbogram were randomly assigned to receive no streptokinase, I think unethically, because we had all the information we needed to know that streptokinase worked: they were deprived of effective treatments. But they weren�t alone, because so were most of the rest of the people in the world at the time.  These stories illustrate, I hope, why systematic reviews and meta-analyses are so important: we need to bring together all of the evidence on a question, not just cherry-pick the bits that we stumble upon, or intuitively like the look of. Mercifully the medical profession has come to recognise this over the past couple of decades, and systematic reviews with meta-analyses are now used almost universally, to ensure that we have the most accurate possible summary of all the trials that have been done on a particular medical question.  But these stories also demonstrate why missing trial results are so dangerous. If one researcher or doctor �cherry-picks�, when summarising the existing evidence, and looks only at the trials that support their hunch, then they can produce a misleading picture of the research. That is a problem for that one individual (and for anyone who is unwise or unlucky enough to be influenced by them). But if we are all missing the negative trials, the entire medical and academic community, around the world, then when we pool the evidence to get the best possible view of what works � as we must do � we are all completely misled. We get a misleading impression of the treatment�s effectiveness: we incorrectly exaggerate its benefits; or perhaps even find incorrectly that an intervention was beneficial, when in reality it did harm.  Now that you understand the importance of systematic reviews, you can see why missing data matters. But you can also appreciate that when I explain how much trial data is missing, I am giving you a clean overview of the literature, because I will be explaining that evidence using systematic reviews.  How much data is missing?  If you want to prove that trials have been left unpublished, you have an interesting problem: you need to prove the existence of studies you don�t have access to. To work around this, people have developed a simple approach: you identify a group of trials you know have been conducted and completed, then check to see if they have been published. Finding a list of completed trials is the tricky part of this job, and to achieve it people have used various strategies: trawling the lists of trials that have been approved by ethics committees (or �institutional review boards� in the USA), for example; or chasing up the trials discussed by researchers at conferences.  In 2008 a group of researchers decided to check for publication of every trial that had ever been reported to the US Food and Drug Administration for all the antidepressants that came onto the market between 1987 and 2004.12 This was no small task. The FDA archives contain a reasonable amount of information on all the trials that were submitted to the regulator in order to get a licence for a new drug. But that�s not all the trials, by any means, because those conducted after the drug has come onto the market will not appear there; and the information that is provided by the FDA is hard to search, and often scanty. But it is an important subset of the trials, and more than enough for us to begin exploring how often trials go missing, and why. It�s also a representative slice of trials from all the major drug companies.  The researchers found seventy-four studies in total, representing 12,500 patients� worth of data. Thirty-eight of these trials had positive results, and found that the new drug worked; thirty-six were negative. The results were therefore an even split between success and failure for the drugs, in reality. Then the researchers set about looking for these trials in the published academic literature, the material available to doctors and patients. This provided a very different picture. Thirty-seven of the positive trials � all but one � were published in full, often with much fanfare. But the trials with negative results had a very different fate: only three were published. Twenty-two were simply lost to history, never appearing anywhere other than in those dusty, disorganised, thin FDA files. The remaining eleven which had negative results in the FDA summaries did appear in the academic literature, but were written up as if the drug was a success. If you think this sounds absurd, I agree: we will see in Chapter 4, on �bad trials�, how a study�s results can be reworked and polished to distort and exaggerate its findings.  This was a remarkable piece of work, spread over twelve drugs from all the major manufacturers, with no stand-out bad guy. It very clearly exposed a broken system: in reality we have thirty-eight positive trials and thirty-six negative ones; in the academic literature we have forty-eight positive trials and three negative ones. Take a moment to flip back and forth between those in your mind: �thirty-eight positive trials, thirty-six negative�; or �forty-eight positive trials and only three negative�.  If we were talking about one single study, from one single group of researchers, who decided to delete half their results because they didn�t give the overall picture they wanted, then we would quite correctly call that act �research misconduct�. Yet somehow when exactly the same phenomenon occurs, but with whole studies going missing, by the hands of hundreds and thousands of individuals, spread around the world, in both the public and private sector, we accept it as a normal part of life.13 It passes by, under the watchful eyes of regulators and professional bodies who do nothing, as routine, despite the undeniable impact it has on patients.  Even more strange is this: we�ve known about the problem of negative studies going missing for almost as long as people have been doing serious science.  This was first formally documented by a psychologist called Theodore Sterling in 1959.14 He went through every paper published in the four big psychology journals of the time, and found that 286 out of 294 reported a statistically significant result. This, he explained, was plainly fishy: it couldn�t possibly be a fair representation of every study that had been conducted, because if we believed that, we�d have to believe that almost every theory ever tested by a psychologist in an experiment had turned out to be correct. If psychologists really were so great at predicting results, there�d hardly be any point in bothering to run experiments at all. In 1995, at the end of his career, the same researcher came back to the same question, half a lifetime later, and found that almost nothing had changed.15  Sterling was the first to put these ideas into a formal academic context, but the basic truth had been recognised for many centuries. Francis Bacon explained in 1620 that we often mislead ourselves by only remembering the times something worked, and forgetting those when it didn�t.16 Fowler in 1786 listed the cases he�d seen treated with arsenic, and pointed out that he could have glossed over the failures, as others might be tempted to do, but had included them.17 To do otherwise, he explained, would have been misleading.  Yet it was only three decades ago that people started to realise that missing trials posed a serious problem for medicine. In 1980 Elina Hemminki found that almost half the trials conducted in the mid-1970s in Finland and Sweden had been left unpublished.18 Then, in 1986, an American researcher called Robert Simes decided to investigate the trials on a new treatment for ovarian cancer. This was an important study, because it looked at a life-or-death question. Combination chemotherapy for this kind of cancer has very tough side effects, and knowing this, many researchers had hoped it might be better to give a single �alkylating agent� drug first, before moving on to full chemotherapy. Simes looked at all the trials published on this question in the academic literature, read by doctors and academics. From this, giving a single drug first looked like a great idea: women with advanced ovarian cancer (which is not a good diagnosis to have) who were on the alkylating agent alone were significantly more likely to survive longer.  Then Simes had a smart idea. He knew that sometimes trials can go unpublished, and he had heard that papers with less �exciting� results are the most likely to go missing. To prove that this has happened, though, is a tricky business: you need to find a fair, representative sample of all the trials that have been conducted, and then compare their results with the smaller pool of trials that have been published, to see if there are any embarrassing differences. There was no easy way to get this information from the medicines regulator (we will discuss this problem in some detail later), so instead he went to the International Cancer Research Data Bank. This contained a register of interesting trials that were happening in the USA, including most of the ones funded by the government, and many others from around the world. It was by no means a complete list, but it did have one crucial feature: the trials were registered before their results came in, so any list compiled from this source would be, if not complete, at least a representative sample of all the research that had ever been done, and not biased by whether their results were positive or negative.  When Simes compared the results of the published trials against the pre-registered trials, the results were disturbing. Looking at the academic literature � the studies that researchers and journal editors chose to publish � alkylating agents alone looked like a great idea, reducing the rate of death from advanced ovarian cancer significantly. But when you looked only at the pre-registered trials � the unbiased, fair sample of all the trials ever conducted � the new treatment was no better than old-fashioned chemotherapy.  Simes immediately recognised � as I hope you will too � that the question of whether one form of cancer treatment is better than another was small fry compared to the depth charge he was about to set off in the medical literature. Everything we thought we knew about whether treatments worked or not was probably distorted, to an extent that might be hard to measure, but that would certainly have a major impact on patient care. We were seeing the positive results, and missing the negative ones. There was one clear thing we should do about this: start a registry of all clinical trials, demand that people register their study before they start, and insist that they publish the results at the end.  That was 1986. Since then, a generation later, we have done very badly. In this book, I promise I won�t overwhelm you with data. But at the same time, I don�t want any drug company, or government regulator, or professional body, or anyone who doubts this whole story, to have any room to wriggle. So I�ll now go through all the evidence on missing trials, as briefly as possible, showing the main approaches that have been used. All of what you are about to read comes from the most current systematic reviews on the subject, so you can be sure that it is a fair and unbiased summary of the results.  One research approach is to get all the trials that a medicines regulator has record of, from the very early ones done for the purposes of getting a licence for a new drug, and then check to see if they all appear in the academic literature. That�s the method we saw used in the paper mentioned above, where researchers sought out every paper on twelve antidepressants, and found that a 50/50 split of positive and negative results turned into forty-eight positive papers and just three negative ones. This method has been used extensively in several different areas of medicine:  ���*�Lee and colleagues, for example, looked for all of the 909 trials �����submitted alongside marketing applications for all ninety new �����drugs that came onto the market from 2001 to 2002: they �����found that 66 per cent of the trials with significant results �����were published, compared with only 36 per cent of the rest.19  ���*�Melander, in 2003, looked for all forty-two trials on five �����antidepressants that were submitted to the Swedish drug �����regulator in the process of getting a marketing authorisation: �����all twenty-one studies with significant results were published; �����only 81 per cent of those finding no benefit were published.20  ���*�Rising et al., in 2008, found more of those distorted write-ups �����that we�ll be dissecting later: they looked for all trials on two �����years� worth of approved drugs. In the FDA�s summary of �����the results, once those could be found, there were 164 trials. �����Those with favourable outcomes were a full four times more �����likely to be published in academic papers than those with �����negative outcomes. On top of that, four of the trials with �����negative outcomes changed, once they appeared in the �����academic literature, to favour the drug.21  If you prefer, you can look at conference presentations: a huge amount of research gets presented at conferences, but our current best estimate is that only about half of it ever appears in the academic literature.22 Studies presented only at conferences are almost impossible to find, or cite, and are especially hard to assess, because so little information is available on the specific methods used in the research (often as little as a paragraph). And as you will see shortly, not every trial is a fair test of a treatment. Some can be biased by design, so these details matter.  The most recent systematic review of studies looking at what happens to conference papers was done in 2010, and it found thirty separate studies looking at whether negative conference presentations � in fields as diverse as anaesthetics, cystic fibrosis, oncology, and A&E � disappear before becoming fully-fledged academic papers.23 Overwhelmingly, unflattering results are much more likely to go missing.  If you�re very lucky, you can track down a list of trials whose existence was publicly recorded before they were started, perhaps on a register that was set up to explore that very question. From the pharmaceutical industry, up until very recently, you�d be very lucky to find such a list in the public domain. For publicly-funded research the story is a little different, and here we start to learn a new lesson: although the vast majority of trials are conducted by the industry, with the result that they set the tone for the community, this phenomenon is not limited to the commercial sector.  ���*�By 1997 there were already four studies in a systematic review �����on this approach. They found that studies with significant �����results were two and a half times more likely to get �����published than those without.24  ���*�A paper from 1998 looked at all trials from two groups of �����triallists sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health over �����the preceding ten years, and found, again, that studies with �����significant results were more likely to be published.25  ���*�Another looked at drug trials notified to the Finnish National �����Agency, and found that 47 per cent of the positive results �����were published, but only 11 per cent of the negative ones.26  ���*�Another looked at all the trials that had passed through the �����pharmacy department of an eye hospital since 1963: 93 per �����cent of the significant results were published, but only 70 per �����cent of the negative ones.27  The point being made in this blizzard of data is simple: this is not an under-researched area; the evidence has been with us for a long time, and it is neither contradictory nor ambiguous.  Two French studies in 2005 and 2006 took a new approach: they went to ethics committees, and got lists of all the studies they had approved, and then found out from the investigators whether the trials had produced positive or negative results, before finally tracking down the published academic papers.28 The first study found that significant results were twice as likely to be published; the second that they were four times as likely. In Britain, two researchers sent a questionnaire to all the lead investigators on 101 projects paid for by NHS R&D: it�s not industry research, but it�s worth noting anyway. This produced an unusual result: there was no statistically significant difference in the publication rates of positive and negative papers.29  But it�s not enough simply to list studies. Systematically taking all the evidence that we have so far, what do we see overall?  It�s not ideal to lump every study of this type together in one giant spreadsheet, to produce a summary figure on publication bias, because they are all very different, in different fields, with different methods. This is a concern in many meta-analyses (though it shouldn�t be overstated: if there are lots of trials comparing one treatment against placebo, say, and they�re all using the same outcome measurement, then you might be fine just lumping them all in together).  But you can reasonably put some of these studies together in groups. The most current systematic review on publication bias, from 2010, from which the examples above are taken, draws together the evidence from various fields.30 Twelve comparable studies follow up conference presentations, and taken together they find that a study with a significant finding is 1.62 times more likely to be published. For the four studies taking lists of trials from before they started, overall, significant results were 2.4 times more likely to be published. Those are our best estimates of the scale of the problem. They are current, and they are damning.  All of this missing data is not simply an abstract academic matter: in the real world of medicine, published evidence is used to make treatment decisions. This problem goes to the core of everything that doctors do, so it�s worth considering in some detail what impact it has on medical practice. Firstly, as we saw in the case of reboxetine, doctors and patients are misled about the effects of the medicines they use, and can end up making decisions that cause avoidable suffering, or even death. We might also choose unnecessarily expensive treatments, having been misled into thinking they are more effective than cheaper older drugs. This wastes money, ultimately depriving patients of other treatments, since funding for health care is never infinite.  It�s also worth being clear that this data is withheld from everyone in medicine, from top to bottom. NICE, for example, is the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, created by the British government to conduct careful, unbiased summaries of all the evidence on new treatments. It is unable either to identify or to access data that has been withheld by researchers or companies on a drug�s effectiveness: NICE has no more legal right to that data than you or I do, even though it is making decisions about effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness, on behalf of the NHS, for millions of people. In fact, as we shall see, the MHRA and EMA (the European Medicines Agency) � the regulators that decide which drugs can go on the market in the UK � often have access to this information, but do not share it with the public, with doctors, or with NICE. This is an extraordinary and perverse situation.  So, while doctors are kept in the dark, patients are exposed to inferior treatments, ineffective treatments, unnecessary treatments, and unnecessarily expensive treatments that are no better than cheap ones; governments pay for unnecessarily expensive treatments, and mop up the cost of harms created by inadequate or harmful treatment; and individual participants in trials, such as those in the TGN1412 study, are exposed to terrifying, life-threatening ordeals, resulting in lifelong scars, again quite unnecessarily.  At the same time, the whole of the research project in medicine is retarded, as vital negative results are held back from those who could use them. This affects everyone, but it is especially egregious in the world of �orphan diseases�, medical problems that affect only small numbers of patients, because these corners of medicine are already short of resources, and are neglected by the research departments of most drug companies, since the opportunities for revenue are thinner. People working on orphan diseases will often research existing drugs that have been tried and failed in other conditions, but that have theoretical potential for the orphan disease. If the data from earlier work on these drugs in other diseases is missing, then the job of researching them for the orphan disease is both harder and more dangerous: perhaps they have already been shown to have benefits or effects that would help accelerate research; perhaps they have already been shown to be actively harmful when used on other diseases, and there are important safety signals that would help protect future research participants from harm. Nobody can tell you.  Finally, and perhaps most shamefully, when we allow unflattering data to go unpublished, we betray the patients who participated in these studies: the people who have given their bodies, and sometimes their lives, in the implicit belief that they are doing something to create new knowledge, that will benefit others in the same position as them in the future. In fact, their belief is not implicit: often it�s exactly what we tell them, as researchers, and it is a lie, because the data might be withheld, and we know it.  So whose fault is this?  Why do negative trials disappear?  In a moment we will see more clear cases of drug companies withholding data � in stories where we can identify individuals � sometimes with the assistance of regulators. When we get to these, I hope your rage might swell. But first, it�s worth taking a moment to recognise that publication bias occurs outside commercial drug development, and in completely unrelated fields of academia, where people are motivated only by reputation, and their own personal interests.  In many respects, after all, publication bias is a very human process. If you�ve done a study and it didn�t have an exciting, positive result, then you might wrongly conclude that your experiment isn�t very interesting to other researchers. There�s also the issue of incentives: academics are often measured, rather unhelpfully, by crude metrics like the numbers of citations for their papers, and the number of �high-impact� studies they get into glamorous well-read journals. If negative findings are harder to publish in bigger journals, and less likely to be cited by other academics, then the incentives to work at disseminating them are lower. With a positive finding, meanwhile, you get a sense of discovering something new. Everyone around you is excited, because your results are exceptional.  One clear illustration of this problem came in 2010. A mainstream American psychology researcher called Daryl Bem published a competent academic paper, in a well-respected journal, showing evidence of precognition, the ability to see into the future.fn1 These studies were well-designed, and the findings were statistically significant, but many people weren�t very convinced, for the same reasons you aren�t: if humans really could see into the future, we�d probably know about it already; and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, rather than one-off findings.  But in fact the study has been replicated, though Bem�s positive results have not been. At least two groups of academics have rerun several of Bem�s experiments, using the exact same methods, and both found no evidence of precognition. One group submitted their negative results to the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, � the very same journal that published Bem�s paper in 2010 � and that journal rejected their paper out of hand. The editor even came right out and said it: we never publish studies that replicate other work.  Here we see the same problem as in medicine: positive findings are more likely to be published than negative ones. Every now and then, a freak positive result is published showing, for example, that people can see into the future. Who knows how many psychologists have tried, over the years, to find evidence of psychic powers, running elaborate, time-consuming experiments, on dozens of subjects � maybe hundreds � and then found no evidence that such powers exist? Any scientist trying to publish such a �So what?� finding would struggle to get a journal to take it seriously, at the best of times. Even with the clear target of Bem�s paper on precognition, which was widely covered in serious newspapers across Europe and the USA, the academic journal with a proven recent interest in the question of precognition simply refused to publish a paper with a negative result. Yet replicating these findings was key � Bem himself said so in his paper � so keeping track of the negative replications is vital too.  People working in real labs will tell you that sometimes an experiment can fail to produce a positive result many times before the outcome you�re hoping for appears. What does that mean? Sometimes the failures will be the result of legitimate technical problems; but sometimes they will be vitally important statistical context, perhaps even calling the main finding of the research into question. Many research findings, remember, are not absolute black-and-white outcomes, but fragile statistical correlations. Under our current system, most of this contextual information about failure is just brushed under the carpet, and this has huge ramifications for the cost of replicating research, in ways that are not immediately obvious. For example, researchers failing to replicate an initial finding may not know if they�ve failed because the original result was an overstated fluke, or because they�ve made some kind of mistake in their methods. In fact, the cost of proving that a finding was wrong is vastly greater than the cost of making it in the first place, because you need to run the experiment many more times to prove the absence of a finding, simply because of the way that the statistics of detecting weak effects work; and you also need to be absolutely certain that you�ve excluded all technical problems, to avoid getting egg on your face if your replication turns out to have been inadequate. These barriers to refutation may partly explain why it�s so easy to get away with publishing findings that ultimately turn out to be wrong.31  Publication bias is not just a problem in the more abstract corners of psychology research. In 2012 a group of researchers reported in the journal Nature how they tried to replicate fifty-three early laboratory studies of promising targets for cancer treatments: forty-seven of the fifty-three could not be replicated.32 This study has serious implications for the development of new drugs in medicine, because such unreplicable findings are not simply an abstract academic issue: researchers build theories on the back of them, trust that they�re valid, and investigate the same idea using other methods. If they are simply being led down the garden path, chasing up fluke errors, then huge amounts of research money and effort are being wasted, and the discovery of new medical treatments is being seriously retarded.  The authors of the study were clear on both the cause of and the solution for this problem. Fluke findings, they explained, are often more likely to be submitted to journals � and more likely to be published � than boring, negative ones. We should give more incentives to academics for publishing negative results; but we should also give them more opportunity.  This means changing the behaviour of academic journals, and here we are faced with a problem. Although they are usually academics themselves, journal editors have their own interests and agendas, and have more in common with everyday journalists and newspaper editors than some of them might wish to admit, as the episode of the precognition experiment above illustrates very clearly. Whether journals like this are a sensible model for communicating research at all is a hotly debated subject in academia, but this is the current situation. Journals are the gatekeepers, they make decisions on what�s relevant and interesting for their audience, and they compete for readers.  This can lead them to behave in ways that don�t reflect the best interests of science, because an individual journal�s desire to provide colourful content might conflict with the collective need to provide a comprehensive picture of the evidence. In newspaper journalism, there is a well-known aphorism: �When a dog bites a man, that�s not news; but when a man bites a dog �� These judgements on newsworthiness in mainstream media have even been demonstrated quantitatively. One study in 2003, for example, looked at the BBC�s health news coverage over several months, and calculated how many people had to die from a given cause for one story to appear. 8,571 people died from smoking for each story about smoking; but there were three stories for every death from new variant CJD, or �mad cow disease�.33 Another, in 1992, looked at print-media coverage of drug deaths, and found that you needed 265 deaths from paracetamol poisoning for one story about such a death to appear in a paper; but every death from MDMA received, on average, one piece of news coverage.34  If similar judgements are influencing the content of academic journals, then we have a problem. But can it really be the case that academic journals are the bottleneck, preventing doctors and academics from having access to unflattering trial results about the safety and effectiveness of the drugs they use? This argument is commonly deployed by industry, and researchers too are often keen to blame journals for rejecting negative findings en masse. Luckily, this has been the subject of some research; and overall, while journals aren�t blameless, it�s hard to claim that they are the main source of this serious public-health problem. This is especially so since there are whole academic journals dedicated to publishing clinical trials, with a commitment to publishing negative results written into their constitutions.  But to be kind, for the sake of completeness, and because industry and researchers are so keen to pass the blame on to academic journals, we can see if what they claim is true.  One survey simply asked the authors of unpublished work if they had ever submitted it for publication. One hundred and twenty-four unpublished results were identified, by following up on every study approved by a group of US ethics committees, and when the researchers contacted the teams behind the unpublished results, it turned out that only six papers had ever actually been submitted and rejected.35 Perhaps, you might say, this was a freak finding. Another approach is to follow up all the papers submitted to one journal, and see if those with negative results are rejected more often. Where this has been tried, the journals seem blameless: 745 manuscripts submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) were followed up, and there was no difference in acceptance rate for significant and non-significant findings.36 The same thing has been tried with papers submitted to the BMJ, the Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine and the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.37 Again and again, no effect was found. Some have argued that this might still represent evidence of editorial bias, if academics know that manuscripts with negative results have to be of higher quality before submission, to get past editors� prejudices. It�s also possible that the journals played fair when they knew they were being watched, although turning around an entire publishing operation for one brief performance would be tough.  These studies all involved observing what has happened in normal practice. One last option is to run an experiment, sending identical papers to various journals, but changing the direction of the results at random, to see if that makes any difference to the acceptance rates. This isn�t something you�d want to do very often, because it wastes a lot of people�s time; but since publication bias matters, it has been regarded as a justifiable intrusion on a few occasions.  In 1990 a researcher called Epstein created a series of fictitious papers, with identical methods and presentation, differing only in whether they reported positive or negative results. He sent them at random to 146 social-work journals: the positive papers were accepted 35 per cent of the time, and the negative ones 26 per cent of the time, a difference that wasn�t large enough to be statistically significant.38  Other studies have tried something similar on a smaller scale, not submitting a paper to a journal, but rather, with the assistance of the journal, sending spoof academic papers to individual peer reviewers: these people do not make the final decision on publication, but they do give advice to editors, so a window into their behaviour would be useful. These studies have had more mixed results. In one from 1977, sham papers with identical methods but different results were sent to seventy-five reviewers. Some bias was found from reviewers against findings that disagreed with their own views.39  Another study, from 1994, looked at reviewers� responses to a paper on TENS machines: these are fairly controversial devices sold for pain relief. Thirty-three reviewers with strong views one way or the other were identified, and again it was found that their judgements on the paper were broadly correlated with their pre-existing views, though the study was small.40 Another paper did the same thing with papers on quack treatments; it found that the direction of findings had no effect on reviewers from mainstream medical journals deciding whether to accept them.41  One final randomised trial from 2010 tried on a grand scale to see if reviewers really do reject ideas based on their pre-existing beliefs (a good indicator of whether journals are biased by results, when they should be focused simply on whether a study is properly designed and conducted). Fabricated papers were sent to over two hundred reviewers, and they were all identical, except for the results they reported: half of the reviewers got results they would like, half got results they wouldn�t. Reviewers were more likely to recommend publication if they received the version of the manuscript with results they�d like (97 per cent vs 80 per cent), more likely to detect errors in a manuscript whose results they didn�t like, and rated the methods more highly in papers whose results they liked.42  Overall, though, even if there are clearly rough edges in some domains, these results don�t suggest that the journals are the main cause of the problem of the disappearance of negative trials. In the experiments isolating the peer reviewers, those individual referees were biased in some studies, but they don�t have the last word on publication, and in all the studies which look at what happens to negative papers submitted to journals in the real world, the evidence suggests that they proceed into print without problems. Journals may not be entirely innocent � The Trouble With Medical Journals by Richard Smith, previously editor of the BMJ, is an excellent overview of their faults;43 and we will see later how they fail to police important and simple flaws in studies. But it would be wrong to lay the blame for publication bias entirely at their door.  In the light of all this, the data on what researchers say about their own behaviour is very revealing. In various surveys they have said that they thought there was no point in submitting negative results, because they would just be rejected by journals: 20 per cent of medical researchers said so in 1998;44 61 per cent of psychology and education researchers said so in 1991;45 and so on.46 If asked why they�ve failed to send in research for publication, the most common reasons researchers give are negative results, a lack of interest, or a lack of time.  This is the more abstract end of academia � largely away from the immediate world of clinical trials � but it seems that academics are mistaken, at best, about the reasons why negative results go missing. Journals may pose some barriers to publishing negative results, but they are hardly absolute, and much of the problem lies in academics� motivations and perceptions.  More than that, in recent years, the era of open-access academic journals has got going in earnest: there are now several, such as Trials, which are free to access, and have a core editorial policy that they will accept any trial report, regardless of result, and will actively solicit negative findings. Trials registers like clinicaltrials.gov will also post results. With offers like this on the table, it is very hard to believe that anyone would really struggle to disseminate the findings of a trial with a negative result if they wanted to. And yet, despite this, negative results continue to go missing, with vast multinational companies simply withholding results on their drugs, even though academics and doctors are desperate to see them.  You might reasonably wonder whether there are people who are supposed to prevent this kind of data from being withheld. The universities where research takes place, for example; or the regulators; or the �ethics committees�, which are charged with protecting patients who participate in research. Unfortunately, our story is about to take a turn to the dark side. We will see that many of the very people and organisations we would have expected to protect patients from the harm inflicted by missing data have, instead, shirked their responsibilities; and worse than that, we will see that many of them have actively conspired in helping companies to withhold data from patients. We are about to hit some big problems, some bad people, and some simple solutions.  How ethics committees and universities have failed us  By now, you will, I hope, share my view that withholding results from clinical trials is unethical, for the simple reason that hidden data exposes patients to unnecessary and avoidable harm. But the ethical transgressions here go beyond the simple harm inflicted on future patients.  Patients and the public participate in clinical trials at some considerable cost to themselves: they expose themselves to hassle and intrusion, because clinical trials almost always require that you have more check-ups on your progress, more blood tests, and more examinations; but participants may also expose themselves to more risk, or the chance of receiving an inferior treatment. People do this out of altruism, on the implicit understanding that the results from their experience will contribute to improving our knowledge of what works and what doesn�t, and so will help other patients in the future. In fact, this understanding isn�t just implicit: in many trials it�s explicit, because patients are specifically told when they sign up to participate that the data will be used to inform future decisions. If this isn�t true, and the data can be withheld at the whim of a researcher or a company, then the patients have been actively lied to. That is very bad news.  So what are the formal arrangements between patients, researchers and sponsors? In any sensible world, we�d expect universal contracts, making it clear that all researchers are obliged to publish their results, and that industry sponsors � which have a huge interest in positive results � must have no control over the data. But despite everything we know about industry-funded research being systematically biased, this does not happen. In fact, quite the opposite is true: it is entirely normal for researchers and academics conducting industry-funded trials to sign contracts subjecting them to gagging clauses which forbid them to publish, discuss or analyse data from the trials they have conducted, without the permission of the funder. This is such a secretive and shameful situation that even trying to document it in public can be a fraught business, as we shall now see.  In 2006 a paper was published in JAMA describing how common it was for researchers doing industry-funded trials to have these kinds of constraints placed on their right to publish the results.47 The study was conducted by the Nordic Cochrane Centre, and it looked at all the trials given approval to go ahead in Copenhagen and Frederiksberg. (If you�re wondering why these two cities were chosen, it was simply a matter of practicality, and the bizarre secrecy that shrouds this world: the researchers applied elsewhere without success, and were specifically refused access to data in the UK.48) These trials were overwhelmingly sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry (98 per cent), and the rules governing the management of the results tell a story which walks the now-familiar line between frightening and absurd.  For sixteen of the forty-four trials the sponsoring company got to see the data as it accumulated, and in a further sixteen they had the right to stop the trial at any time, for any reason. This means that a company can see if a trial is going against it, and can interfere as it progresses. As we will see later (early stopping, breaking protocols, pp.186, 202), this distorts a trial�s results with unnecessary and hidden biases. For example, if you stop a trial early because you have been peeking at the preliminary results, then you can either exaggerate a modest benefit, or bury a worsening negative result. Crucially, the fact that the sponsoring company had this opportunity to introduce bias wasn�t mentioned in any of the published academic papers reporting the results of these trials, so nobody reading the literature could possibly know that these studies were subject � by design � to such an important flaw.  Even if the study was allowed to finish, the data could still be suppressed. There were constraints on publication rights in forty of the forty-four trials, and in half of them the contracts specifically stated that the sponsor either owned the data outright (what about the patients, you might say?), or needed to approve the final publication, or both. None of these restrictions was mentioned in any of the published papers, and in fact, none of the protocols or papers said that the sponsor had full access to all the data from the trial, or the final say on whether to publish.  It�s worth taking a moment to think about what this means. The results of all these trials were subject to a bias that will significantly distort the academic literature, because trials that show early signs of producing a negative result (or trials that do produce a negative result) can be deleted from the academic record; but nobody reading these trials could possibly have known that this opportunity for censorship existed.  The paper I�ve just described was published in JAMA, one of the biggest medical journals in the world. Shortly afterwards, a shocking tale of industry interference appeared in the BMJ.49 Lif, the Danish pharmaceutical industry association, responded to the paper by announcing in the Journal of the Danish Medical Association that it was �both shaken and enraged about the criticism, that could not be recognised�. It demanded an investigation of the scientists, though it failed to say by whom, or of what. Then Lif wrote to the Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty, accusing the Cochrane researchers of scientific misconduct. We can�t see the letter, but the Cochrane researchers say the allegations were extremely serious � they were accused of deliberately distorting the data � but vague, and without documents or evidence to back them up.  Nonetheless, the investigation went on for a year, because in academia people like to do things properly, and assume that all complaints are made in good faith. Peter G�tzsche, the director of the Cochrane centre, told the BMJ that only Lif�s third letter, ten months into this process, made specific allegations that could be investigated by the committee. Two months later the charges were dismissed. The Cochrane researchers had done nothing wrong. But before they were cleared, Lif copied the letters alleging scientific dishonesty to the hospital where four of them worked, and to the management organisation running that hospital, and sent similar letters to the Danish Medical Association, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Science, and so on. G�tzsche and his colleagues said that they felt �intimidated and harassed� by Lif�s behaviour. Lif continued to insist that the researchers were guilty of misconduct even after the investigation was completed. So, researching in this area is not easy: it�s hard to get funding, and the industry will make your work feel like chewing on a mouthful of wasps.  Even though the problem has been widely recognised, attempts to fix it have failed.50 The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, for example, stood up in 2001, insisting that the lead author of any study it published must sign a document stating that the researchers had full access to the data, and full control over the decision to publish. Researchers at Duke University, North Carolina, then surveyed the contracts between medical schools and industry sponsors, and found that this edict was flouted as a matter of routine. They recommended boilerplate contracts for the relationship between industry and academia. Was this imposed? No. Sponsors continue to control the data.  Half a decade later, a major study in the New England Journal of Medicine investigated whether anything had changed.51 Administrators at all 122 accredited medical schools in the US were asked about their contracts (to be clear, this wasn�t a study of what they did; rather it was a study of what they were willing to say in public). The majority said contract negotiations over the right to publish data were �difficult�. A worrying 62 per cent said it was OK for the clinical trial agreement between academics and industry sponsor to be confidential. This is a serious problem, as it means that anyone reading a study cannot know how much interference was available to the sponsor, which is important context for the person reading and interpreting the research. Half of the centres allowed the sponsor to draft the research paper, which is another interesting hidden problem in medicine, as biases and emphases can be quietly introduced (as we shall see in more detail in Chapter 6). Half said it was OK for contracts to forbid researchers sharing data after the research was completed and published, once again hindering research. A quarter said it was acceptable for the sponsor to insert its own statistical analyses into the manuscript. Asked about disputes, 17 per cent of administrators had seen an argument about who had control of data in the preceding year.  Sometimes, disputes over access to such data can cause serious problems in academic departments, when there is a divergence of views on what is ethical. Aubrey Blumsohn was a senior lecturer at Sheffield University, working on a project funded by Procter & Gamble to research an osteoporosis drug called risedronate.52 The aim was to analyse blood and urine samples from an earlier trial, led by Blumsohn�s head of department, Professor Richard Eastell. After signing the contracts, P&G sent over some �abstracts�, brief summaries of the findings, with Blumsohn�s name as first author, and some summary results tables. That�s great, said Blumsohn, but I�m the researcher here: I�d like to see the actual raw data and analyse it myself. The company declined, saying that this was not their policy. Blumsohn stood his ground, and the papers were left unpublished. Then, however, Blumsohn saw that Eastell had published another paper with P&G, stating that all the researchers had �had full access to the data and analyses�. He complained, knowing this was not true. Blumsohn was suspended by Sheffield University, which offered him a gagging clause and �145,000, and he was eventually forced out of his job. Eastell, meanwhile, was censured by the General Medical Council, but only after a staggering delay of several years, and he remains in post.  So contracts that permit companies and researchers to withhold or control data are common, and they�re bad news. But that�s not just because they lead to doctors and patients being misled about what works. They also break another vitally important contract: the agreement between researchers and the patients who participate in their trials.  People participate in trials believing that the results of that research will help to improve the treatment of patients like them in the future. This isn�t just speculation: one of the few studies to ask patients why they have participated in a trial found that 90 per cent believed they were making a �major� or �moderate� contribution to society, and 84 per cent felt proud that they were making this contribution.53 Patients are not stupid or na�ve to believe this, because it is what they are told on the consent forms they sign before participating in trials. But they are mistaken, because the results of trials are frequently left unpublished, and withheld from doctors and patients. These signed consent forms therefore mislead people on two vitally important points. Firstly, they fail to tell the truth: that the person conducting the trial, or the person paying for it, may decide not to publish the results, depending on how they look at the end of the study. And worse than that, they also explicitly state a falsehood: researchers tell patients that they are participating in order to create knowledge that will be used to improve treatment in future, even though the researchers know that in many cases, those results will never be published.  There is only one conclusion that we can draw from this: consent forms routinely lie to patients participating in trials. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, made all the more extraordinary by the huge amounts of red tape that everyone involved in a trial must negotiate, closely monitoring endless arcane pieces of paperwork, and ensuring that patients are fully informed on the minutiae of their treatment. Despite all this regulatory theatre, which hinders good research on routine practice (as we shall see � p.232), we allow these forms to tell patients outright lies about the control of data, and we fail to police one of the most important ethical problems in the whole of medicine. The deceit of these consent forms is, to me, a good illustration of how broken and outdated the regulatory frameworks of medicine have become. But it also, finally, poses a serious problem for the future of research.  We desperately need patients to continue to believe that they are contributing to society, because trial recruitment is in crisis, and it is increasingly hard to persuade patients to participate at all. In one recent study, a third of all trials failed to reach their original recruitment target, and more than half had to be awarded an extension.54 If word gets out that trials are often more promotional than genuinely scientific, recruitment will become even more difficult. The answer is not to hide this problem, but rather to fix it.  So universities and ethics committees may have failed us, but there is one group of people we might expect to step up, to try to show some leadership on missing trial data. These are the medical and academic professional bodies, the Royal Colleges of General Practice, Surgery and Physicians, the General Medical Council, the British Medical Association, the pharmacists� organisations, the bodies representing each sub-specialty of academia, the respiratory physiologists, the pharmacologists, the Academy of Medical Sciences, and so on.  These organisations have the opportunity to set the tone of academic and clinical medicine, in their codes of conduct, their aspirations, and in some cases their rules, since some have the ability to impose sanctions, and all have the ability to exclude those who fail to meet basic ethical standards. We have established, I hope, beyond any doubt, that non-publication of trials in humans is research misconduct, that it misleads doctors and harms patients around the world. Have these organisations used their powers, stood up and announced, prominently and fiercely, that this must stop, and that they will take action?  One has: the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine, a small organisation of doctors � largely working in the industry � with 1,400 members. And none of the others have bothered.  Not one.  What can be done?  There are several simple solutions to these problems, which fall into three categories. There is no argument against any of the following suggestions that I am aware of. The issue of missing data has been neglected through institutional inertia, and reluctance by senior academics to challenge industry. Their failure to act harms patients every day.  Gagging clauses  If there is nothing to be ashamed of in gagging clauses � if companies, and legislators, and academics, and university contracts departments, all believe that they are acceptable � then everything should be out in the open, prominently flagged up, so that everyone outside those systems can decide if they agree.  ���1.�Until they can be eradicated, where gagging clauses exist, �����patients should be told, at the time they are invited to �����participate in a trial, that the company sponsoring it is allowed �����to hide the results if it doesn�t like them. The consent form �����should also explain clearly that withholding negative results �����will lead to doctors and patients being misled about the �����effectiveness of the treatment being trialled, and so exposed �����to unnecessary harm. Trial participants can then decide for �����themselves if they think these contracts are acceptable.  ���2.�Wherever the sponsoring company has the contractual right �����to gag publication, even if it doesn�t exercise that right, the �����fact that a gagging clause existed should be stated clearly: �����in the academic paper; in the trial protocol; and in the publicly �����available trial registry entry that goes up before the trial �����starts. Readers of the trial findings can then decide for �����themselves if they trust that sponsor and research group to �����publish all negative findings, and interpret any reported �����positive findings in that light.  ���3.�All university contracts should follow the same boilerplate �����format, and forbid gagging clauses. Failing that, all universities �����should be forced to prominently declare which contracts �����with gagging clauses they have permitted, and to publish those �����clauses online for all to see, so that all can be alerted that the �����institution is producing systematically biased research, and �����discount any findings from them accordingly.  ���4.�In legislation, gagging clauses should be made illegal, with no �����possibility of quibbles. If there is a dispute about analysis or �����interpretation between the people running the trial and the �����people paying for it, it should take place in the published �����academic literature, or some other public forum. Not in secret.  Professional bodies  ���1.�All professional bodies should take a clear stand on �����unpublished trial data, declare it clearly as research �����misconduct, and state that it will be handled like any other �����form of serious misconduct that misleads doctors and harms �����patients.That they have not done so is a stain on the reputation �����of these organisations, and on their senior members.  ���2.�All research staff involved in any trial on humans should be �����regarded as jointly and severally liable for ensuring that it is �����published in full within one year of completion.  ���3.All those responsible for withholding trial data should have �����their names prominently posted in a single database, so �����that others can be made aware of the risk of working with �����them, or allowing them access to patients for research, in �����future.  Ethics committees  ���1.No person should be allowed to conduct trials in humans if a �����research project they are responsible for is currently �����withholding trial data from publication more than one year �����after completion. Where any researcher on a project has a �����previous track record of delayed publication of trial data, the �����ethics committee should be notified, and this should be taken �����into account, as with any researcher guilty of research �����misconduct.  ���2.No trial should be approved without a firm guarantee of �����publication within one year of completion.  How regulators and journals have failed us  So far we�ve established that ethics committees, universities and the professional bodies of medical researchers have all failed to protect patients from publication bias, even though the selective non-publication of unflattering data is a serious issue for medicine. We know that it distorts and undermines every decision that researchers, doctors and patients make, and that it exposes patients to avoidable suffering and death. This is not seriously disputed, so you might reasonably imagine that governments, regulators and medical journals must all have tried to address it.  They have tried, and failed. Worse than simply failing, they have repeatedly provided what we might regard as �fake fixes�: we have seen small changes in regulations and practices, announced with great fanfare, but then either ignored or bypassed. This has given false reassurance to doctors, academics and the public that the problem has been fixed. What follows is the story of these fake fixes.  Registers  The earliest and simplest solution proposed was to open registers of trials: if people are compelled to publish their protocol, in full, before they start work, then we at least have the opportunity to go back and check to see if they�ve published the trials that they�ve conducted. This is very useful, for a number of reasons. A trial protocol describes in great technical detail everything that researchers will do in a trial: how many patients they�ll recruit, where they�ll come from, how they�ll be divided up, what treatment each group will get, and what outcome will be measured to establish if the treatment was successful. Because of this, it can be used to check whether a trial was published, but also whether its methods were distorted along the way, in a manner that would allow the results to be exaggerated (as described in Chapter 4).  The first major paper to call for a registry of clinical trial protocols was published in 1986,55 and it was followed by a flood. In 1990 Iain Chalmers (we can call him Sir Iain Chalmers if you likefn2) published a classic paper called �Underreporting Research is Scientific Misconduct�,57 and he has traced the chequered history of trials registers in the UK.58 In 1992, as the Cochrane Collaboration began to gather influence, representatives of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) asked to meet Chalmers.59 After explaining the work of Cochrane, and the vital importance of summarising all the trial results on a particular drug, he explained very clearly to them how biased under-reporting of results harms patients.  The industry�s representatives were moved, and soon they took action. Mike Wallace, the chief executive of Schering and a member of that ABPI delegation, agreed with Chalmers that withholding data was ethically and scientifically indefensible, and said that he planned to do something concrete to prevent it, if only to protect the industry from having the issue forced upon it in less welcome terms. Wallace stepped out of line from his colleagues, and committed to registering every trial conducted by his company with Cochrane. This was not a popular move, and he was reprimanded by colleagues, in particular those from other companies.  But then GlaxoWellcome followed suit, and in 1998 its chief executive, Richard Sykes, wrote an editorial in the BMJ called �Being a modern pharmaceutical company involves making information available on clinical trial programmes�.60 �Programmes� was the crucial word, because as we�ve seen, and as we shall see in greater detail later, you can only make sense of individual findings if you assess them in the context of all the work that has been done on a drug.  GlaxoWellcome set up a clinical trials registry, and Elizabeth Wager, the head of the company�s medical writers group, pulled together a group from across the industry to develop ethical guidelines for presenting research. The ABPI, seeing individual companies take the lead, saw the writing on the wall: it decided to commend GlaxoWellcome�s policy to the whole industry, and launched this initiative at a press conference where Chalmers � a strong critic � sat on the same side of the table as the industry. AstraZeneca, Aventis, MSD, Novartis, Roche, Schering Healthcare and Wyeth began registering some of their trials � only the ones involving UK patients, and retrospectively � but there was movement at last.  At the same time, there was movement in America. The 1997 FDA Modernization Act created clinicaltrials.gov, a register run by the US government National Institutes of Health. This legislation required that trials should be registered, but only if they related to an application to put a new drug on the market, and even then, only if it was for a serious or life-threatening disease. The register opened in 1998, and the website clinicaltrials.gov went online in 2000. The entry criteria were widened in 2004.  But soon it all began to fall apart. GlaxoWellcome merged with SmithKline Beecham to become GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and initially the new logo appeared on the old trials register. Iain Chalmers wrote to Jean-Paul Garnier, the chief executive of the new company, to thank him for maintaining this valuable transparency: but no reply ever came. The registry website was closed, and the contents were lost (though GSK was later forced to open a new register, as part of a settlement with the US government over the harm caused by its withholding of data on new drug trials just a couple of years later). Elizabeth Wager, the author of the Good Publication Practice guidelines for drug companies, was out of a job, as her writing department at GSK was closed. Her guidelines were ignored.61  From the moment that these registries were first suggested, and then opened, it was implicitly assumed that the shame of producing this public record, and then not publishing your study, would be enough to ensure that people would do the right thing. But the first problem for the US register, which could have been used universally, was that people simply chose not to use it. The regulations required only a very narrow range of trials to be posted, and nobody else was in a hurry to post their trials if they didn�t have to.  In 2004 the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) � a collection of editors from the most influential journals in the world � published a policy statement, announcing that none of them would publish any clinical trials after 2005, unless they had been properly registered before they began.62 They did this, essentially, to force the hand of the industry and researchers: if a trial has a positive result, then people desperately want to publish it in the most prestigious journal they can find. Although they had no legal force, the journal editors did have the thing that companies and researchers wanted most: the chance of a major journal publication. By insisting on pre-registration, they were doing what they could to force researchers and industry sponsors to register all trials. Everyone rejoiced: the problem had been fixed.  If you think it seems odd � and perhaps unrealistic � that fixing this crucial flaw in the information architecture of a $700 billion industry should be left to an informal gathering of a few academic editors, with no legislative power, then you�d be right. Although everybody began to talk as if publication bias was a thing of the past, in reality it was continuing just as before, because the journal editors simply ignored their own threats and promises. Later (pp.247, 307) we will see the phenomenal financial inducements on offer to editors for publishing positive industry papers, which can extend to millions of dollars in reprint and advertising revenue. But first we should look at what they actually did after their solemn promise in 2005.  In 2008 a group of researchers went through every single trial published in the top ten medical journals, every one of which was a member of the ICMJE, after the deadline for pre-registration. Out of 323 trials published during 2008 in these high-impact academic journals, only half were adequately registered (before the trial, with the main outcome measure properly specified), and trial registration was entirely lacking for over a quarter.63 The ICMJE editors had simply failed to keep their word.  Meanwhile, in Europe, there were some very bizarre developments. With enormous fanfare, the European Medicines Agency created a registry of trials called EudraCT. EU legislation requires all trials to be posted here if they involve any patients in Europe, and many companies will tell you that they�ve met their responsibilities for transparency by doing so. But the contents of this EU register have been kept entirely secret. I can tell you that it contains around 30,000 trials, since that figure is in the public domain, but that is literally all I know, and all anyone can know. Despite EU legislation requiring that the public should be given access to the contents of this register, it remains closed. This creates an almost laughable paradox: the EU clinical trials register is a transparency tool, held entirely in secret. Since March 2011, after heavy media criticism (from me at any rate), a subset of trials has slowly been made public through a website called EudraPharm. As of summer 2012, although the agency now claims that its register is accessible to all, at least 10,000 trials are still missing, and the search engine doesn�t work properly.64 It�s absolutely one of the strangest things I�ve ever seen, and nobody other than the EU even regards this peculiar exercise as a trials register: I certainly don�t, I doubt you do, and both the ICMJE and the World Health Organization have explicitly stated that EudraCT is not a meaningful register.  But new work was being done in the US, and it seemed sensible. In 2007 the FDA Amendment Act was passed. This is much tighter: it requires registration of all trials of any drug or device, at any stage of development other than �first-in-man� tests, if they have any site in the US, or involve any kind of application to bring a new drug onto the market. It also imposes a startling new requirement: all results of all trials must be posted to clinicaltrials.gov, in abbreviated summary tables, within one year of completion, for any trial on any marketed drug that completes after 2007.  Once again, to great fanfare, everyone believed that the problem had been fixed. But it hasn�t been, for two very important reasons.  Firstly, unfortunately, despite the undoubted goodwill, requiring the publication of all trials starting from �now� does absolutely nothing for medicine today. There is no imaginable clinic, anywhere in the world, at which medicine is practised only on the basis of trials that completed within the past three years, using only drugs that came to market since 2008. In fact, quite the opposite is true: the vast majority of drugs currently in use came to market over the past ten, twenty or thirty years, and one of the great challenges for the pharmaceutical industry today is to create drugs that are anything like as innovative as those that were introduced in what has come to be known as the �golden era� of pharmaceutical research, when all the most widely used drugs, for all the most common diseases, were developed. Perhaps they were the �low-lying fruit�, plucked from the research tree, but in any case, these are the tablets we use.  And crucially, it is for these drugs � the ones we actually use � that we need the evidence: from trials completed in 2005 or 1995. These are the drugs that we are prescribing completely blind, misled by a biased sample of trials, selectively published, with the unflattering data buried in secure underground data archives somewhere in the hills (I am told) of Cheshire.  But there is a second, more disturbing reason why these regulations should be taken with a pinch of salt: they have been widely ignored. A study published in January 2012 looked at the first slice of trials subject to mandatory reporting, and found that only one in five had met its obligation to post results.65 Perhaps this is not surprising: the fine for non-compliance is $10,000 a day, which sounds spectacular, until you realise that it�s only $3.5 million a year, which is chickenfeed for a drug bringing in $4 billion a year. And what�s more, no such fine has ever been levied, throughout the entire history of the legislation.  So that, in total, is why I regard the ICMJE, the FDA and the EU�s claims to have addressed this problem as �fake fixes�. In fact, they have done worse than fail: they have given false reassurance that the problem has been fixed, false reassurance that it has gone away, and they have led us to take our eyes off the ball. For half a decade now, people in medicine and academia have talked about publication bias as if it was yesterday�s problem, discovered in the 1990s and early 2000s, and swiftly fixed.  But the problem of missing data has not gone away, and soon we will see exactly how shameless some companies and regulators can be, in the very present day.  What can be done?  The ICMJE should keep its promises, the EU should be less risible, and the FDA Amendment Act 2007 should be muscularly enforced. But there are many more disappointments to come, so I will leave my action plan on missing data for later in this chapter.  Blood from a stone: trying to get data from regulators  So far we�ve established that doctors and patients have been failed by a range of different people and organisations, all of whom we might have expected to step up and fix the problem of missing data, since it harms patients in large numbers around the world. We have seen that governments take no action against those who fail to publish their results, despite the public pretence to the contrary; and that they take no action against those who fail to register their trials. We have seen that medical journal editors continue to publish unregistered trials, despite the public pretence that they have taken a stand. We have seen that ethics committees fail to insist on universal publication, despite their stated aim of protecting patients. And we have seen that professional bodies fail to take action against what is obviously research misconduct, despite evidence showing that the problem of missing data is of epidemic proportions.66  While the published academic record is hopelessly distorted, you might hope that there is one final route which patients and doctors could use to get access to the results of clinical trials: the regulators, which receive large amounts of data from drug companies during the approval process, must surely have obligations to protect patients� safety? But this, sadly, is just one more example of how we are failed by the very bodies that are supposed to be protecting us.  In this section, we will see three key failures. Firstly, the regulators may not have the information in the first place. Secondly, the way in which they �share� summary trial information with doctors and patients is broken and shabby. And finally, if you try to get all of the information that a drug company has provided � the long-form documents, where the bodies are often buried � then regulators present bizarre barriers, blocking and obfuscating for several years at a time, even on drugs that turn out to be ineffective and harmful. Nothing of what I am about to tell you is in any sense reassuring.  One: Information is withheld from regulators  Paroxetine is a commonly used antidepressant, from the class of drugs known as �selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors�, or SSRIs. You will hear more about this class of drugs later in this book, but here we will use paroxetine to show how companies have exploited our longstanding permissiveness about missing trials, and found loopholes in our inadequate regulations on trial disclosure. We will see that GSK withheld data about whether paroxetine works as an antidepressant, and even withheld data about its harmful side effects, but most importantly, we will see that what it did was all entirely legal.  To understand why, we first need to go through a quirk of the licensing process. Drugs do not simply come onto the market for use in all medical conditions: for any specific use of any drug, in any specific disease, you need a separate marketing authorisation. So, a drug might be licensed to treat ovarian cancer, for example, but not breast cancer. That doesn�t mean the drug doesn�t work in breast cancer. There might well be some evidence that it�s great for treating that disease too, but maybe the company hasn�t gone to the trouble and expense of getting a formal marketing authorisation for that specific use. Doctors can still go ahead and prescribe it for breast cancer, if they want, because the drug is available for prescription, and there are boxes of it sitting in pharmacies waiting to go out (even though, strictly speaking, it�s only got marketing approval for use in ovarian cancer). In this situation the doctor will be prescribing the drug legally, but �off-label�.  This is fairly common, as getting a marketing authorisation for a specific use can be time-consuming and expensive. If doctors know that there�s a drug which has been shown in good-quality trials to help treat a disease, it would be perverse and unhelpful of them not to prescribe it, just because the company hasn�t applied for a formal licence to market it for that specific use. I�ll discuss the ins and outs of all this in more detail later. But for now, what you need to know is that the use of a drug in children is treated as a separate marketing authorisation from its use in adults.  This makes sense in many cases, because children can respond to drugs in very different ways to adults, so the risks and benefits might be very different, and research needs to be done in children separately. But this licensing quirk also brings some disadvantages. Getting a licence for a specific use is an arduous business, requiring lots of paperwork, and some specific studies. Often this will be so expensive that companies will not bother to get a licence specifically to market a drug for use in children, because that market is usually much smaller.  But once a drug is available in a country for one specific thing, as we have seen, it can then be prescribed for absolutely anything. So it is not unusual for a drug to be licensed for use in adults, but then prescribed for children on the back of a hunch; or a judgement that it should at least do no harm; or studies that suggest benefit in children, but that would probably be insufficient to get through the specific formal process of getting marketing authorisation for use in kids; or even good studies, but in a disease where the market is so small that the company can�t be bothered to get a marketing approval for use in children.  Regulators have recognised that there is a serious problem with drugs being used in children �off-label�, without adequate research, so recently they have started to offer incentives for companies to conduct the research, and formally seek these licences. The incentives are patent extensions, and these can be lucrative. All drugs slip into the public domain about a decade after coming onto the market, and become like paracetamol, which anyone can make very cheaply. If a company is given a six-month extension on a drug, for all uses, then it can make a lot more money from that medicine. This seems a good example of regulators being pragmatic, and thinking creatively about what carrots they can offer. Licensed use in children will probably not itself make a company much extra money, since doctors are prescribing the drug for children already, even without a licence or good evidence, simply because there are no other options. Meanwhile, six months of extra patent life for a blockbuster drug will be very lucrative, if its adult market is large enough.  There�s a lot of debate about whether the drug companies have played fair with these offers. For example, since the FDA started offering this deal, about a hundred drugs have been given paediatric licences, but many of them were for diseases that aren�t very common in children, like stomach ulcers, or arthritis. There have been far fewer applications for less lucrative products that could be used in children, such as more modern medicines called �large-molecule biologics�. But there it is.  When GSK applied for a marketing authorisation in children for paroxetine, an extraordinary situation came to light, triggering the longest investigation in the history of UK drugs regulation. This investigation was published in 2008, and examined whether GSK should face criminal charges.67 It turned out that what the company had done � withholding important data about safety and effectiveness that doctors and patients clearly needed to see � was plainly unethical, and put children around the world at risk; but our laws are so weak that GSK could not be charged with any crime.  Between 1994 and 2002 GSK conducted nine trials of paroxetine in children.68 The first two failed to show any benefit, but the company made no attempt to inform anyone of this by changing the �drug label� that is sent to all doctors and patients. In fact, after these trials were completed, an internal company management document stated: �it would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine�. In the year after this secret internal memo, 32,000 prescriptions were issued to children for paroxetine in the UK alone: so, while the company knew the drug didn�t work in children, it was in no hurry to tell doctors that, despite knowing that large numbers of children were taking it. More trials were conducted over the coming years � nine in total � and none showed that the drug was effective at treating depression in children.  It gets much worse than that. These children weren�t simply receiving a drug that the company knew to be ineffective for them: they were also being exposed to side effects. This should be self-evident, since any effective treatment will have some side effects, and doctors factor this in, alongside the benefits (which in this case were non-existent). But nobody knew how bad these side effects were, because the company didn�t tell doctors, or patients, or even the regulator about the worrying safety data from its trials. This was because of a loophole (on which more in a couple of pages� time): you only had to tell the regulator about side effects reported in studies looking at the specific uses for which the drug has a marketing authorisation. Because the use of paroxetine in children was �off-label�, GSK had no legal obligation at the time to tell anyone about what it had found.  People had worried for a long time that paroxetine might increase the risk of suicide, though that is quite a difficult side effect to detect in an antidepressant, because people with depression are at a much higher risk of suicide than the general population anyway, as a result of their depression. There are also some grounds to believe that as patients first come out of their depression, and leave behind the sluggish lack of motivation that often accompanies profound misery, there may be a period during which they are more capable of killing themselves, just because of the depression slowly lifting.  Furthermore, suicide is a mercifully rare event, which means you need a lot of people on a drug to detect an increased risk. Also, suicide is not always recorded accurately on death certificates, because coroners and doctors are reluctant to give a verdict that many would regard as shameful, so the signal you are trying to detect in the data � suicide � is going to be corrupted. Suicidal thoughts or behaviours that don�t result in death are more common than suicide itself, so they should be easier to detect, but they too are hard to pick up in routinely collected data, because they�re often not presented to doctors, and where they are, they can be coded in health records in all sorts of different ways, if they appear at all. Because of all these difficulties, you would want to have every scrap of data you could possibly cobble together on the question of whether these drugs cause suicidal thoughts or behaviour in children; and you would want a lot of experienced people, with a wide range of skills, all looking at the data and discussing it.  In February 2003, GSK spontaneously sent the MHRA a package of information on the risk of suicide on paroxetine, containing some analyses done in 2002 from adverse-event data in trials the company had held, going back a decade. This analysis showed that there was no increased risk of suicide. But it was misleading: although it was unclear at the time, data from trials in children had been mixed in with data from trials in adults, which had vastly greater numbers of participants. As a result, any sign of increased suicide risk among children on paroxetine had been completely diluted away.  Later in 2003, GSK had a meeting with the MHRA to discuss another issue involving paroxetine. At the end of this meeting, the GSK representatives gave out a briefing document, explaining that the company was planning to apply later that year for a specific marketing authorisation to use paroxetine in children. They mentioned, while handing out the document, that the MHRA might wish to bear in mind a safety concern the company had noted: an increased risk of suicide among children with depression who received paroxetine, compared with those on dummy placebo pills.  This was vitally important side-effect data, being presented, after an astonishing delay, casually, through an entirely inappropriate and unofficial channel. GSK knew that the drug was being prescribed in children, and it knew that there were safety concerns in children, but it had chosen not to reveal that information. When it did share the data, it didn�t flag it up as a clear danger in the current use of the drug, requiring urgent attention from the relevant department in the regulator; instead it presented it as part of an informal briefing about a future application. Although the data was given to completely the wrong team, the MHRA staff present at this meeting had the wit to spot that this was an important new problem. A flurry of activity followed: analyses were done, and within one month a letter was sent to all doctors advising them not to prescribe paroxetine to patients under the age of eighteen.  How is it possible that our systems for getting data from companies are so poor that they can simply withhold vitally important information showing that a drug is not only ineffective, but actively dangerous? There are two sets of problems here: firstly, access for regulators; and secondly, access for doctors.  There is no doubt that the regulations contain ridiculous loopholes, and it�s dismal to see how GSK cheerfully exploited them. As I�ve mentioned, the company had no legal duty to give over the information, because prescription of the drug in children was outside of paroxetine�s formally licensed uses � even though GSK knew this was widespread. In fact, of the nine studies the company conducted, only one had its results reported to the MHRA, because that was the only one conducted in the UK.  After this episode, the MHRA and the EU changed some of their regulations, though not adequately, and created an obligation for companies to hand over safety data for uses of a drug outside its marketing authorisation, closing the paroxetine loophole.  This whole incident illustrates a key problem, and it is one that recurs throughout this section of the book: you need all of the data in order to see what�s happening with a drug�s benefits, and risks. Some of the trials that GSK conducted were published in part, but that is obviously not enough: we already know that if we see only a biased sample of the data, we are misled. But we also need all the data for the more simple reason that we need lots of data: safety signals are often weak, subtle and difficult to detect. Suicidal thoughts and plans are rare in children � even those with depression, even those on paroxetine � so all the data from a large number of participants needed to be combined before the signal was detectable in the noise. In the case of paroxetine, the dangers only became apparent when the adverse events from all of the trials were pooled and analysed together.  That leads us to the second obvious flaw in the current system: the results of these trials � the safety data and the effectiveness data � are given in secret to the regulator, which then sits and quietly makes a decision. This is a huge problem, because you need many eyes on these difficult problems. I don�t think that the people who work in the MHRA are bad, or incompetent: I know a lot of them, and they are smart, good people. But we shouldn�t trust them to analyse this data alone, in the same way that we shouldn�t trust any single organisation to analyse data alone, with nobody looking over its shoulder, checking the working, providing competition, offering helpful criticism, speeding it up, and so on.  This is even worse than academics failing to share their primary research data, because at least in an academic paper you get a lot of detail about what was done, and how. The output of a regulator is often simply a crude, brief summary: almost a �yes� or �no� about side effects. This is the opposite of science, which is only reliable because everyone shows their working, explains how they know that something is effective or safe, shares their methods and their results, and allows others to decide if they agree with the way they processed and analysed the data.  Yet for the safety and efficacy of drugs, one of the most important of all analyses done by science, we turn our back on this process completely: we allow it to happen behind closed doors, because drug companies have decided that they want to share their trial results discreetly with the regulators. So the most important job in evidence-based medicine, and a perfect example of a problem that benefits from many eyes and minds, is carried out alone and in secret.  This perverse and unhealthy secrecy extends way beyond regulators. NICE, the UK�s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, is charged with making recommendations about which treatments are most cost-effective, and which work best. When it does this, it�s in the same boat as you or me: it has absolutely no statutory right to see data on the safety or effectiveness of a drug, if a company doesn�t want to release it, even though the regulators have all of that data. For �single technology appraisals�, on one treatment, they ask the company to make available to them the information the company thinks is relevant. For �guidelines� on treatment in a whole area of medicine, they are more vulnerable to what is published in journals. As a result, even NICE can end up working on distorted, edited, biased samples of the data.  Sometimes NICE is able to access some extra unpublished data from the drug companies: this is information that doctors and patients aren�t allowed to see, despite the fact that they are the people making decisions about whether to prescribe the drugs, or are actually taking them. But when NICE does get information in this way, it can come with strict conditions on confidentiality, leading to some very bizarre documents being published. On the opposite page, for example, is the NICE document discussing whether it�s a good idea to have Lucentis, an extremely expensive drug, costing well over �1,000 per treatment, that is injected into the eye for a condition called acute macular degeneration.  As you can see, the NICE document on whether this treatment is a good idea is censored. Not only is the data on the effectiveness of the treatment blanked out by thick black rectangles, in case any doctor or patient should see it; absurdly, even the names of some trials are missing, preventing the reader from even knowing of their existence, or cross referencing information about them. Most disturbing of all, as you can see in the last bullet point, the data on adverse events is also censored: I�m reproducing the whole page here because I worry that it would otherwise be almost too bizarre for you to believe. This level of censorship isn�t an everyday phenomenon; but it illustrates the absurdity of what medicine has come to accept, in professional documents that most people wouldn�t bother to read.69  Why shouldn�t we all � doctors, patients and NICE � have access to the information on trials that regulators see? This is something I asked both Kent Woods from the MHRA, and Hans Georg Eichler, Medical Director of the European Medicines Agency, in 2010. Both, separately, gave me the same answer: people outside the agencies cannot be trusted with this information, because they might misinterpret it, either deliberately or through incompetence. Both, separately � though I guess they must chat at parties � raised the MMR vaccine scare, as the classic example of how the media can contrive a national panic on the basis of no good evidence, creating dangerous public-health problems along the way. What if they released raw safety data, and people who don�t know how to analyse it properly found imaginary patterns, and created scares that put patients off taking life-saving medication?  I accept that this is a risk, but I also believe their priorities are wrong: I think that the advantages of many eyes working on these vitally important problems are enormous, and the possibility of a few irrational scaremongers is no excuse for hiding data. Drug companies and regulators also both say that you can already get all the information you need from regulators� websites, in summary form.  We shall now see that this is untrue.  Two: Regulators make it hard to access the data they do have  When exposed to criticism, drug companies often become indignant, and declare that they already share enough data for doctors and patients to be informed. �We give everything to the regulator,� they say, �and you can get it from them.� Similarly, regulators insist that all you need to do is look on their website, and you will easily find all the data you need. In reality, there is a messy game, in which doctors and academics trying to find all the data on a drug are sent around the houses, scrabbling for information that is both hard to find and fatally flawed.  Firstly, as we�ve already seen, regulators don�t have all the trials, and they don�t share all the ones that they do. Summary documents are available on the early trials used to get a drug onto the market in the first place, but only for the specific licensed uses of the drug. Even where the regulator has been given safety data for off-label uses (following the paroxetine case above) the information from these trials still isn�t made publicly available through the regulator: it simply sits quietly in the regulator�s files.  For example: duloxetine is another drug in fairly widespread use, which is usually given as an antidepressant. During a trial on its use for a completely different purpose � treating incontinence � there were apparently several suicides.70 This is important and interesting information, and the FDA holds the relevant data: it conducted a review on this issue, and came to a view on whether the risk was significant. But you cannot see any of that on the FDA website, because duloxetine never got a licence for use in treating incontinence.71 The trial data was only used by the FDA to inform its internal ruminations. This is an everyday situation.  But even when you are allowed to see trial results held by regulators, getting this information from their public websites is supremely tricky. The search functions on the FDA website are essentially broken, while the content is haphazard and badly organised, with lots missing, and too little information to enable you to work out if a trial was prone to bias by design. Once again � partly, here, through casual thoughtlessness and incompetence � it is impossible to get access to the basic information that we need. Drug companies and regulators deny this: they say that if you search their websites, everything is there. So let�s walk, briefly, through the process in all its infuriating glory. The case I will use was published three years ago in JAMA as a useful illustration of how broken the FDA site has become:72 replicating it today, in 2012, nothing has changed.  So: let�s say we want to find the results from all the trials the FDA has, on a drug called pregabalin, in which the drug is used to treat pain for diabetics whose nerves have been affected by their disease (a condition called �diabetic peripheral neuropathy�). You want the FDA review on this specific use, which is the PDF document containing all the trials in one big bundle. But if you search for �pregabalin review�, say, on the FDA website, you get over a hundred documents: none of them is clearly named, and not one of them is the FDA review document on pregabalin. If you type in the FDA application number � the unique identifier for the FDA document you�re looking for � the FDA website comes up with nothing at all.  If you�re lucky, or wise, you�ll get dropped at the Drugs@FDA page: typing �pregabalin� there brings up three �FDA applications�. Why three? Because there are three different documents, each on a different condition that pregabalin can be used to treat. The FDA site doesn�t tell you which condition each of these three documents is for, so you have to use trial and error to try to find out. That�s not as easy as it sounds. I have the correct document for pregabalin and diabetic peripheral neuropathy right here in front of me: it�s almost four hundred pages long, but it doesn�t tell you that it�s about diabetic peripheral neuropathy until you get to here. There�s no executive summary at the beginning � in fact, there�s no title page, no contents page, no hint of what the document is even about, and it skips randomly from one sub-document to another, all scanned and bundled up in the same gigantic file.  If you�re a nerd, you might think: these files are electronic; they�re PDFs, a type of file specifically designed to make sharing electronic documents convenient. Any nerd will know that if you want to find something in an electronic document, it�s easy: you just use the �find� command: type in, say, �peripheral neuropathy�, and your computer will find the phrase straight off. But no: unlike almost any other serious government document in the world, the PDFs from the FDA are a series of photographs of pages of text, rather than the text itself. This means you cannot search for a phrase. Instead, you have to go through it, searching for that phrase, laboriously, by eye.  I could go on. I will. There�s some kind of �table of contents� on the seventeenth page, but it gets the page numbers wrong. I�ve finished now. There is simply no reason for this obfuscation and chaos. These problems aren�t caused by technical issues specific to trials, and they would hardly cost any money at all to fix. This is plainly, simply, unhelpful, and the best we can hope is that it�s driven by thoughtlessness.  That�s a tragedy, because if you can unearth this document, and decode it, you will find that it is full of terrifying gems: perfect examples of situations in which a drug company has used dodgy statistical methods to design and analyse a study, in such a way that it is predestined � from the outset � to exaggerate the benefits of the drug.  For example, in the five trials on pregabalin and pain, lots of people dropped out during the study period. This is common in medical trials, as you will shortly see, and it often happens because people have found a drug to be unhelpful, or have had bad side effects. During these trials you�re measuring pain at regular intervals. But if some people drop out, you�re left with an important question: what kind of pain score should you use for them in your results? We know, after all, that people dropping out are more likely to have done badly on the drug.  Pfizer decided to use a method called �Last Observation Carried Forward�, which means what you�d expect: you take the last measurement of pain severity while the patients were on the drug, from just before they dropped out, and then paste that in for all the remaining pain measures that they missed, after they stopped coming to follow-up appointments.  The FDA disapproved of this: it pointed out, quite correctly, that Pfizer�s strategy would make the drug look better than it really is. For a fairer picture, we have to assume that the drop-outs stopped taking the drug because of side effects, so their pain score should reflect the reality, which is that they would never get any benefit from the drug in normal use. The correct level of pain to record for them is, therefore, their pain at the beginning of the study, before they had any kind of treatment (if you�re interested, this is called �Baseline Observation Carried Forward�). The analysis was duly redone, properly, and a more modest, more accurate view of the benefits of the drug was produced. In this case, it turns out that using the �last observation� method overestimated the improvement in pain by about a quarter.  Here�s the catch. Four out of five of these trials were then published in the peer-reviewed academic literature, the place where doctors look for evidence on whether a drug works or not (one trial wasn�t published at all). Every single one of the published analyses used �Last Observation Carried Forward�, the dodgy method, the one that exaggerates the benefits of the drug. Not one of them acknowledges that �last observation� is a technique that overstates these benefits.  You can see why it is important that we have access to all the information we can possibly get on every drug trial: not only are some whole trials withheld from us, but there are often hidden flaws in the methods used. The devil is in the detail, and there are many dodgy trials, as we shall soon see, with flaws that may not be clear even in the academic papers, let alone in the thin and uninformative summaries from regulators. Furthermore, as we shall also see very shortly, there are often worrying discrepancies between the regulators� summary documents and what actually happened in the trial.  This is why we need to get hold of a more detailed document on each trial: something called the Clinical Study Report (CSR). These are long pieces of work, sometimes thousands of pages, but they are complete enough for the reader to reconstruct exactly what happened to all the participants; and they will let you find out where the bodies are buried. Drug companies give this study report to the regulator � though still only for formally licensed uses of the drug � so both have a copy, and both should be happy to hand it over.  We will now see what happens when you ask them.  Three: Regulators withhold study reports that they do have  In 2007, researchers from the Nordic Cochrane Centre were working on a systematic review for two widely used diet drugs, orlistat and rimonabant. A systematic review, as you know, is the gold-standard summary of the evidence on whether a treatment is effective. These are life-saving, because they give us the best possible understanding of the true effects of a treatment, including its side effects. But doing this requires access to all of the evidence: if some is missing, especially if unflattering data is deliberately harder to obtain, we will be left with a distorted picture.  The researchers knew that the trial data they were able to find in the published academic literature was probably incomplete, because negative trials are routinely left unpublished. But they also knew that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) would have much of this information, since the manufacturers of drugs are obliged to give the study reports to the regulator when trying to get them onto the market. Since regulators are supposed to act in the interests of patients, they applied to the EMA for the protocols and the study reports. That was in June 2007.  In August, the EMA responded: it had decided not to give out the study reports for these trials, and was invoking the section of its rules which allows it to protect the commercial interests and intellectual property of drug companies. The researchers replied immediately, almost by return of post: there is nothing in the study reports that will undermine the protection of someone�s commercial interests, they explained. But if there was, could the EMA please explain why it felt the commercial interests of the drug companies should override the welfare of patients?  We should pause for just one moment, and think about what the EMA is doing here. It is the regulator that approves and monitors drugs for the whole of Europe, with the aim of protecting the public. Doctors and patients can only make meaningful decisions about treatments if they have access to all the data. The EMA has that data, but has decided that the drug companies� interests are more important. Having spoken to a lot of people in regulation, I can offer one small insight into what on earth they might be thinking. Regulators, in my experience, are preoccupied with the idea that they see all the data, and use it to make the decision about whether a drug should go on the market, and that this is enough: doctors and patients don�t need to see the data, because the regulator has done all that work.  This misunderstands a crucial difference between the decisions made by regulators and the decisions made by doctors. Contrary to what some regulators seem to think, a drug is not either �good� and therefore on the market, or �bad� and therefore off it. A regulator makes a decision about whether it�s in the interests of the population as a whole that the drug should be available for use, at all, ever � even if only in some very obscure circumstance, infrequently and cautiously. This bar is set pretty low, as we shall see, and lots of drugs that are on the market (in fact, the overwhelming majority) are hardly ever used.  A doctor needs to use the same information as that available to the regulator in order to make a very different decision: is this the right drug for the patient in front of me right now? The simple fact that a drug is approved for prescription doesn�t mean it�s particularly good, or the best. In fact, there are complex decisions to be made in each clinical situation about which drug is best. Maybe the patient has failed to get better on one drug, so you want to try another, from a different class of drugs; maybe the patient has mild kidney failure, so you don�t want to use the most popular drug, as that causes very occasional problems in patients with dodgy kidneys; maybe you need a drug that won�t interfere with other drugs the patient is taking.  These complex considerations are the reason we are OK with having a range of drugs on the market: even if some of them are less useful overall, they might be useful in specific circumstances. But we need to be able to see all of the information about them, in order to make these decisions. It is not enough for the regulators to grandly state that they have approved a drug, and therefore we should all feel happy to prescribe it. Doctors and patients need the data just as much as regulators do.  In September 2007 the EMA confirmed to the Cochrane researchers that it wasn�t going to share the study reports on orlistat and rimonabant, and explained that it had a policy of never disclosing the data given as part of a marketing authorisation. A serious problem had emerged. These weight-loss drugs were being widely prescribed throughout Europe, but doctors and patients were unable to access important information about whether they worked, how bad the side effects were, which was more effective, or any of a whole host of other important questions. Real patients were being exposed to potential harm, in everyday prescribing decisions, through this lack of information that was enforced by the EMA.  The researchers went to the European Ombudsman with two clear allegations. Firstly, the EMA had failed to give sufficient reasons for refusing them access to the data; and secondly, the EMA�s brief, dismissive claim that commercial interests must be protected was unjustified, because there was no material of commercial interest in the trial results, other than the data on safety and effectiveness, which doctors and patients obviously need to access. They didn�t know it at the time, but this was the beginning of a battle for data that would shame the EMA, and would last more than three years.  It took four months for the EMA to respond, and over the next year it simply reiterated its position: as far as it was concerned, any kind of information the disclosure of which would �unreasonably undermine or prejudice the commercial interests of individuals or companies� was commercially confidential. The study reports, it said, might contain information about the commercial plans for the drug. The researchers responded that this was unlikely, but was in any case of marginal importance, as part of a much more important and pressing situation: �As a likely consequence of [the] EMA�s position, patients would die unnecessarily, and would be treated with inferior and potentially harmful drugs.� They regarded the EMA�s position as ethically indefensible. More than that, they said, the EMA had a clear conflict of interest: this data could be used to challenge its summary views on the benefits and risks of these treatments. The EMA had failed to explain why doctors and patients having access to study reports and protocols should undermine anyone�s reasonable commercial interests, and why these commercial interests were more important than the welfare of patients.  Then, almost two years into this process, the EMA changed tack. Suddenly, it began to argue that study reports contain personal data about individual patients. This argument hadn�t been raised by the EMA before, but it�s also not true. There may have been some information in some whole sections of the study reports that gave detail on some individual participants� odd presentations, or on possible side effects, but these were all in the same appendix, and could easily be removed.  The EU Ombudsman�s conclusions were clear: the EMA had failed in its duty to give an adequate or even coherent explanation of why it was refusing access to this important information. He made a preliminary finding of maladministration. After doing that, he was under no obligation to offer any further opinion on the weak excuses offered by the EMA, but he decided to do so anyway. His report is damning. The EMA had flatly failed to address a serious charge that its withholding information about these trials was against the public interest, and exposed patients to harm. The Ombudsman also described how he had gone through the study reports in detail himself, and had found that they contained neither any commercially confidential information, nor any details about the commercial development of the drugs. The EMA�s claims that answering the request would have put it under an inappropriate administrative burden were untrue, and it had overestimated the work this would have involved: specifically, he explained, removing any personal data, where it did sometimes appear, would be easy.  The Ombudsman told the EMA to hand over the data, or produce a convincing explanation of why it shouldn�t. Amazingly, the EMA, the drugs regulator covering the whole of Europe, still refused to hand over the documents. During this delay, people certainly suffered unnecessarily, and some possibly also died, simply for want of information. But the behaviour of the EMA then deteriorated even further, into the outright surreal. Any scrap of the company�s thinking about how to run the trial, it argued, which could be intuited from reading the study reports and protocols, was commercially sensitive with respect to its thoughts and plans. This was true, the EMA said, even though the drugs were already on the market, and the information was from final clinical trials, at the very end of the commercial drug-development process. The researchers responded that this was perverse: they knew that withheld data is often negative, so if anything, any other company seeing negative data about these drugs would be less likely to try to get a competitor to market, if it appeared that the benefits of the drugs were more modest than had been thought.  That wasn�t the end of it. The EMA also grandly dismissed the idea that lives were at risk, stating that the burden of proof was on the researchers to demonstrate this. To me this is � if you can forgive me � a slightly contemptuous attitude, especially given what happens in the next paragraph. It�s plainly true that if doctors and patients are unable to see which is the best treatment, then they will make worse decisions, exposing patients to unnecessary harm. Furthermore, it is obvious that larger numbers of academics making transparent judgements about publicly accessible trial data are a much more sensible way of determining the risks and benefits of an intervention than a brief blanket �yes or no� edict and summary from a regulator. This is all true of drugs like orlistat and rimonabant, but it�s also true of any drug, and we will see many cases where academics spotted problems with drugs that regulators had missed.  Then, in 2009, one of the two drugs, rimonabant, was taken off the market, on the grounds that it increases the risk of serious psychiatric problems and suicide. This, at the same time that the EMA was arguing that researchers were wrong to claim that withholding information was harming patients.  And then the EMA suddenly claimed that the design of a randomised trial itself is commercially confidential information.  In case it needs reiterating, let me remind you that the first trial appears in the Bible, Daniel 1:12, and although the core ideas have certainly been refined over time, all trials are essentially identical experiments, generic across any field, with the basics of a modern trial sketched out at least half a century ago. There is absolutely no earthly sense in which anyone could realistically claim that the design of a randomised controlled trial is a commercially confidential or patentable piece of intellectual property.  This was now a farce. The researchers opened all barrels. The EMA was in breach of the Declaration of Helsinki, the international code of medical ethics, which states that everyone involved in research has a duty to make trial findings public. The researchers knew that published papers give a flattering subset of the trial data, and so did the EMA. Patients would die if the EMA continued to withhold data. There was nothing of serious commercial value in there. The EMA�s brief public summaries of the data were inaccurate. The EMA was complicit in the exploitation of patients for commercial gain.  It was now August 2009, and the researchers had been fighting for more than two years for access to data on two widely prescribed drugs, from the very organisation that is supposed to be protecting patients and the public. They weren�t alone. The French �prescribers� bulletin� Prescrire was trying at the same time to get the EMA�s documents on rimonabant. It was sent some unhelpful documents, including the rather remarkable �Final Assessment Report�, from the Swedish agency that had handled the drug�s approval much earlier. You can read this PDF in full online. Or rather, you can�t. On the following page you can see exactly what the scientific analysis of the drug looked like � the document the EMA sent to one of France�s most respected journals for doctors.73 I think it tells a rather clear story, and to add to the insult, there are sixty pages of this in total.  In the meantime, the Danish Medical Authority had handed over fifty-six study reports to Cochrane (though it still needed more from the EMA); a complaint from the drug company about this had been rejected by the Danish government, which had seen no problem with commercial information (there was none), nor administrative hassle (it was minimal), nor the idea that the design of a randomised trial is commercial information (which is laughable). This was chaos. The EMA � which you may remember was responsible for EudraCT, the transparency tool that is held in secret � was going out on a very peculiar limb. It seemed that it would do anything it could to withhold this information from doctors and patients. As we shall see, sadly, this level of secrecy is its stock in trade.  But now we come to the end of this particular road for the EMA. It handed the full, final study reports over to the Ombudsman, reminding him that even the table of contents for each was commercial. Once he had had these documents in his hand, his final opinion came swiftly. There was no commercial data here. There was no confidential patient information here. Hand it over to the public, now. The EMA, at glacial pace, agreed to set a deadline for delivering the data to the researchers, doctors and patients who needed it. The Ombudsman�s final ruling was published at the end of November 2010.74 The initial complaint was made in June 2007. That is a full three and a half years of fighting, obstruction and spurious arguments from the EMA, during which one of the drugs had to be removed from the market because it was harming patients.  After this precedent had been set, things had to shift at the EMA; it was forced to revise its approach, and study reports were briefly made more widely available under a new policy (this window has just been shut down, in 2013, as you will read in the Afterword). But even this policy of sharing reports did not solve the problem of access to all information about a trial: the EMA often doesn�t hold all the modules, of all the reports, for all the uses of all the medicines it has approved. And it only holds records for the most recent few years, which is hopelessly incomplete, since in medicine we use treatments that have come on the market over the past few decades. In fact, this loophole is illustrated by the very first request made by the Cochrane researchers who won this great breakthrough with the Ombudsman. They applied for documents on antidepressants: a good place to start, since these drugs have been the focus of some particularly bad behaviour over the years (though we should remember that missing trial data pervades every corner of medicine). What happened next was even more bizarre than the EMA�s three-year battle to withhold information on orlistat and rimonabant.  The researchers put in their request to the EMA, but were told that the drugs had been approved back in the era when marketing authorisations were given out by individual countries, rather than by the EMA centrally. These local authorisations were then �copied� to all other nations. The MHRA, the UK drugs regulator, held the information the researchers wanted, so they would have to approach it for a copy. The researchers dutifully wrote to the MHRA, asked for the reports on a drug called fluoxetine, and then waited patiently. Finally the answer came: the MHRA explained that it would be happy to hand over this information, but there was a problem.  The documents had all been shredded.75  This was in keeping, it explained, with the agency�s retention policy, which was that such documents were only kept if they were of particular scientific, historical or political interest, and the files didn�t meet those criteria. Let�s just take a moment to think through what the criteria must be. The SSRI antidepressant drugs have seen many scandals on hidden data, and that should be enough on its own, but if you think back to the beginning of this chapter, one of them � paroxetine � was involved in an unprecedented, four-year-long investigation into whether criminal charges could be brought against GSK. That investigation into paroxetine was the largest investigation that the MHRA has ever conducted into drug safety: in fact, it was the largest investigation the MHRA has ever conducted, of any kind, ever. Quite apart from that, these original study reports contain vitally important data on safety and efficacy. But the MHRA shredded them all the same, feeling that they were not of sufficient scientific, historical or political interest.76  I can only leave you there.  Where are we so far?  The missing data saga is long and complex, and involves patients around the world being put at risk, and some major players which have let us down to an extraordinary extent. Since we are almost at the end of it, this is a good moment to gather together what we�ve seen so far.  Trials are frequently conducted, but then left unpublished, and so are unavailable to doctors and patients. Only half of all trials get published, and those with negative results are twice as likely to go missing as those with positive ones. This means that the evidence on which we base decisions in medicine is systematically biased to overstate the benefits of the treatments we give. Since there is no way to compensate for this missing data, we have no way of knowing the true benefits and risks of the drugs doctors prescribe.  This is research misconduct on a grand, international scale. The reality of the problem is universally recognised, but nobody has bothered to fix it:  ���*Ethics committees allow companies and individual �����researchers with a track record of unpublished data to do more �����trials on human participants.  ���*University administrators and ethics committees permit �����contracts with industry that explicitly say the sponsor can �����control the data.  ���*Registers have never been enforced.  ���*Academic journals continue to publish trials that were �����unregistered, despite pretending that they won�t.  ���*Regulators have information that would be vital to improve �����patient care, but are systematically obstructive:  ���*they have poor systems to share poor summaries of the �����information that they do have;  ���*and they are bizarrely obstructive of people asking for more �����information.  ���*Drug companies hold trial results that even regulators don�t �����see.  ���*Governments have never implemented laws compelling �����companies to publish data.  ���*Doctors� and academics� professional bodies have done nothing.  What to do about all this?  You will need to wait, because in the next section there are even greater horrors to come.  Trying to get trial data from drug companies: the story of Tamiflu  Governments around the world have spent billions of pounds on stockpiling a drug called Tamiflu. In the UK alone we have spent several hundred million pounds � the total figure is not yet clear � and so far we�ve bought enough tablets to treat 80 per cent of the population if an outbreak of bird flu occurs. I�m very sorry if you have the flu, because it�s horrid being ill; but we have not spent all this money to reduce the duration of your symptoms in the event of a pandemic by a few hours (though Tamiflu does do this, fairly satisfactorily). We have spent this money to reduce the rate of �complications�: a medical euphemism, meaning pneumonia and death.  Lots of people seem to think Tamiflu will do this. The US Department of Health and Human Services said it would save lives and reduce hospital admissions. The European Medicines Agency said it would reduce complications. The Australian drugs regulator said so too. Roche�s website said it reduces complications by 67 per cent.77 But what is the evidence that Tamiflu really will reduce complications? Answering questions like this is the bread and butter of the Cochrane Collaboration, which you will remember is the vast and independent non-profit international collaboration of academics producing hundreds of systematic reviews on important questions in medicine every year. In 2009 there was concern about a flu pandemic, and an enormous amount of money was being spent on Tamiflu. Because of this, the UK and Australian governments specifically asked the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group to update its earlier reviews on the drug.  Cochrane reviews are in a constant review cycle, because evidence changes over time as new trials are published. This should have been a pretty everyday piece of work: the previous review, in 2008, had found some evidence that Tamiflu does indeed reduce the rate of complications. But then a Japanese paediatrician called Keiji Hayashi left a comment that would trigger a revolution in our understanding of how evidence-based medicine should work. This wasn�t in a publication, or even a letter: it was a simple online comment, posted underneath the Tamiflu review on the Cochrane website.  You�ve summarised the data from all the trials, he explained, but your positive conclusion is really driven by data from just one of the papers you cite, an industry-funded meta-analysis led by an author called Kaiser. This, �the Kaiser paper�, summarises the findings of ten earlier trials, but from these ten trials, only two have ever been published in the scientific literature. For the remaining eight, your only information comes from the brief summary in this secondary, industry source. That�s not reliable enough.  In case it�s not immediately obvious, this is science at its best. The Cochrane review is readily accessible online; it explains transparently the methods by which it looked for trials, and then analysed them, so any informed reader can pull the review apart, and understand where the conclusions came from. Cochrane provides an easy way for readers to raise criticisms. And, crucially, these criticisms did not fall on deaf ears. Tom Jefferson is an editor at the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group, and the lead author on the 2008 review. He realised immediately that he had made a mistake in blindly trusting the Kaiser data. He said so, without any defensiveness, and then set about getting the information in a straight, workpersonlike fashion. This began a three-year battle, which is still not resolved, but which has thrown stark light on the need for all researchers to have access to clinical study reports on trials wherever possible.  First, the Cochrane researchers wrote to the authors of the Kaiser paper, asking for more information. In reply, they were told that this team no longer had the files, and that they should contact Roche, the manufacturer of Tamiflu. So naturally they wrote to Roche and asked for the data.  This is where the problems began. Roche said it would hand over some data, but the Cochrane reviewers would need to sign a confidentiality agreement. This was an impossibility for any serious scientist: it would prevent them from conducting a systematic review with any reasonable degree of openness and transparency. More than this, the proposed contract also raised serious ethical issues, in that it would have required the Cochrane team to actively withhold information from the reader: it included a clause saying that on signing it, the reviewers would never be allowed to discuss the terms of this secrecy agreement; and more than that, they would be forbidden from ever publicly acknowledging that it even existed. Roche was demanding a secret contract, with secret terms, requiring secrecy about trial data, in a discussion about the safety and efficacy of a drug that has been taken by hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Jefferson asked for clarification, and never received a reply.  Then, in October 2009, the company changed tack: they would like to hand the data over, they explained, but another meta-analysis was being conducted elsewhere. Roche had given them the study reports, so Cochrane couldn�t have them. This was a simple non-sequitur: there is no reason why many groups shouldn�t all work on the same question. In fact, quite the opposite: replication is the cornerstone of good science. Roche�s excuse made no sense. Jefferson asked for clarification, but never received a reply.  One week later, unannounced, Roche sent seven short documents, each around a dozen pages long. These contained excerpts of internal company documents on each of the clinical trials in the Kaiser meta-analysis. This was a start, but it didn�t contain anything like enough information for Cochrane to assess the benefits, or the rate of adverse events, or fully to understand exactly what methods were used in the trials.  At the same time, it was rapidly becoming clear that there were odd inconsistencies in the information on this drug. Firstly, there was considerable disagreement at the level of the broad conclusions drawn by different organisations. The FDA said there were no benefits on complications, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (in charge of public health in the USA � some wear nice naval uniforms in honour of their history on the docks) said it did reduce complications. The Japanese regulator made no claim for complications, but the EMA said there was a benefit. In a sensible world, we might think that all these organisations should sing from the same hymn sheet, because all would have access to the same information. Of course, there is also room for occasional, reasonable disagreement, especially where there are close calls: this is precisely why doctors and researchers should have access to all the information about a drug, so that they can make their own judgements.  Meanwhile, reflecting these different judgements, Roche�s own websites said completely different things in different jurisdictions, depending on what the local regulator had said. It�s na�ve, perhaps, to expect consistency from a drug company, but from this and other stories it�s clear that industry utterances are driven by the maximum they can get away with in each territory, rather than any consistent review of the evidence.  In any case, now that their interest had been piqued, the Cochrane researchers also began to notice that there were odd discrepancies between the frequency of adverse events in different databases. Roche�s global safety database held 2,466 neuropsychiatric adverse events, of which 562 were classified as �serious�. But the FDA database for the same period held only 1,805 adverse events in total. The rules vary on what needs to be notified to whom, and where, but even allowing for that, this was odd.  In any case, since Roche was denying them access to the information needed to conduct a proper review, the Cochrane team concluded that they would have to exclude all the unpublished Kaiser data from their analysis, because the details could not be verified in the normal way. People cannot make treatment and purchasing decisions on the basis of trials if the full methods and results aren�t clear: the devil is often in the detail, as we shall see in Chapter 4, on �bad trials�, so we cannot blindly trust that every study is a fair test of the treatment.  This is particularly important with Tamiflu, because there are good reasons to think that these trials were not ideal, and that published accounts were incomplete, to say the least. On closer examination, for example, the patients participating were clearly unusual, to the extent that the results may not be very relevant to normal everyday flu patients. In the published accounts, patients in the trials are described as typical flu patients, suffering from normal flu symptoms like cough, fatigue, and so on. We don�t do blood tests on people with flu in routine practice, but when these tests are done � for surveillance purposes � then even during peak flu season only about one in three people with �flu� will actually be infected with the influenza virus, and most of the year only one in eight will really have it. (The rest are sick from something else, maybe just a common cold virus.)  Two thirds of the trial participants summarised in the Kaiser paper tested positive for flu. This is bizarrely high, and means that the benefits of the drug will be overstated, because it is being tested on perfect patients, the very ones most likely to get better from a drug that selectively attacks the flu virus. In normal practice, which is where the results of these trials will be applied, doctors will be giving the drug to real patients who are diagnosed with �flu-like illness�, which is all you can realistically do in a clinic. Among these real patients, many will not actually have the influenza virus. This means that in the real world, the benefits of Tamiflu on flu will be diluted, and many more people will be exposed to the drug who don�t actually have flu virus in their systems. This, in turn, means that the side effects are likely to creep up in significance, in comparison with any benefits. That is why we strive to ensure that all trials are conducted in normal, everyday, realistic patients: if they are not, their findings may not be relevant to the real world.  So the Cochrane review was published without the Kaiser data in December 2009, alongside some explanatory material about why the Kaiser results had been excluded, and a small flurry of activity followed. Roche put the short excerpts it had sent over online, and committed to make full study reports available (it still hasn�t done so).  What Roche posted was incomplete, but it began a journey for the Cochrane academics of learning a great deal more about the real information that is collected on a trial, and how that can differ from what is given to doctors and patients in the form of brief, published academic papers. At the core of every trial is the raw data: every single record of blood pressure of every patient, the doctors� notes describing any unusual symptoms, investigators� notes, and so on. A published academic paper is a short description of the study, usually following a set format: an introductory background; a description of the methods; a summary of the important results; and then finally a discussion, covering the strengths and weaknesses of the design, and the implications of the results for clinical practice.  A clinical study report, or CSR, is the intermediate document that stands between these two, and can be very long, sometimes thousands of pages.78 Anybody working in the pharmaceutical industry is very familiar with these documents, but doctors and academics have rarely heard of them. They contain much more detail on things like the precise plan for analysing the data statistically, detailed descriptions of adverse events, and so on.  These documents are split into different sections, or �modules�. Roche has shared only �module 1�, for only seven of the ten study reports Cochrane has requested. These modules are missing vitally important information, including the analysis plan, the randomisation details, the study protocol (and the list of deviations from that), and so on. But even these incomplete modules were enough to raise concerns about the universal practice of trusting academic papers to give a complete story about what happened to the patients in a trial.  For example, looking at the two papers out of ten in the Kaiser review which were published, one says: �There were no drug-related serious adverse events,� and the other doesn�t mention adverse events. But in the �module 1� documents on these same two studies, there are ten serious adverse events listed, of which three are classified as being possibly related to Tamiflu.79  Another published paper describes itself as a trial comparing Tamiflu against placebo. A placebo is an inert tablet, containing no active ingredient, that is visually indistinguishable from the pill containing the real medicine. But the CSR for this trial shows that the real medicine was in a grey and yellow capsule, whereas the placebos were grey and ivory. The �placebo� tablets also contained something called dehydrocholic acid, a chemical which encourages the gall bladder to empty.80 Nobody has any clear idea of why, and it�s not even mentioned in the academic paper; but it seems that this was not actually an inert, dummy pill placebo.  Simply making a list of all the trials conducted on a subject is vitally important if we want to avoid seeing only a biased summary of the research done on a subject; but in the case of Tamiflu even this proved to be almost impossible. For example, Roche Shanghai informed the Cochrane group of one large trial (ML16369), but Roche Basel seemed not to know of its existence. But by setting out all the trials side by side, the researchers were able to identify peculiar discrepancies: for example, the largest �phase 3� trial � one of the large trials that are done to get a drug onto the market � was never published, and is rarely mentioned in regulatory documents.fn3  There were other odd discrepancies. Why, for example, was one trial on Tamiflu published in 2010, ten years after it was completed?82 Why did some trials report completely different authors, depending on where they were being discussed?83 And so on.  The chase continued. In December 2009 Roche had promised: �full study reports will also be made available on a password-protected site within the coming days to physicians and scientists undertaking legitimate analyses�. This never happened. Then an odd game began. In June 2010 Roche said: Oh, we�re sorry, we thought you had what you wanted. In July it announced that it was worried about patient confidentiality (you may remember this from the EMA saga). This was an odd move: for most of the important parts of these documents, privacy is no issue at all. The full trial protocol, and the analysis plan, are both completed before any single patient is ever touched. Roche has never explained why patient privacy prevents it from releasing the study reports. It simply continued to withhold them.  Then in August 2010 it began to make some even more bizarre demands, betraying a disturbing belief that companies are perfectly entitled to control access to information that is needed by doctors and patients around the world to make safe decisions. Firstly, it insisted on seeing the Cochrane reviewers� full analysis plan. Fine, they said, and posted the whole protocol online. Doing so is completely standard practice at Cochrane, as it should be for any transparent organisation, and allows people to suggest important changes before you begin. There were few surprises, since all Cochrane reports follow a pretty strict manual anyway. Roche continued to withhold its study reports (including, ironically, its own protocols, the very thing it demanded Cochrane should publish, and that Cochrane had published, happily).  By now Roche had been refusing to publish the study reports for a year. Suddenly, the company began to raise odd personal concerns. It claimed that some Cochrane researchers had made untrue statements about the drug, and about the company, but refused to say who, or what, or where. �Certain members of Cochrane Group involved with the review of the neuraminidase inhibitors,� it announced, �are unlikely to approach the review with the independence that is both necessary and justified.� This is an astonishing state of affairs, where a company feels it should be allowed to prevent individual researchers access to data that should be available to all; but still Roche refused to hand over the study reports.  Then it complained that the Cochrane reviewers had begun to copy journalists in on their emails when responding to Roche staff. I was one of the people copied in on these interactions, and I believe that this was exactly the correct thing to do. Roche�s excuses had become perverse, and the company had failed to keep its promise to share all study reports. It�s clear that the modest pressure exerted by researchers in academic journals alone was having little impact on Roche�s refusal to release the data, and this is an important matter of public health, both for the individual case of this Tamiflu data, and for the broader issue of companies and regulators harming patients by withholding information.  Then things became even more perverse. In January 2011 Roche announced that the Cochrane researchers had already been given all the data they need. This was simply untrue. In February it insisted that all the studies requested were published (meaning academic papers, now shown to be misleading on Tamiflu). Then it declared that it would hand over nothing more, saying: �You have all the detail you need to undertake a review.� But this still wasn�t true: it was still withholding the material it had publicly promised to hand over �within a few days� in December 2009, a year and a half earlier.  At the same time, the company was raising the broken arguments we have already seen: it�s the job of regulators to make these decisions about benefit and risk, it said, not academics. Now, this claim fails on two important fronts. Firstly, as with many other drugs, we now know that not even the regulators had seen all the data. In January 2012 Roche claimed that it �has made full clinical study data available to health authorities around the world for their review as part of the licensing process�. But the EMA never received this information for at least fifteen trials. This was because the EMA had never requested it.  And that brings us on to our final important realisation: regulators are not infallible. They make outright mistakes, and they make decisions which are open to judgement, and should be subject to second-guessing and checking by many eyes around the world. In the next chapter we will see more examples of how regulators can fail, behind closed doors, but here we will look at one story that illustrates the benefit of �many eyes� perfectly.  Rosiglitazone is a new kind of diabetes drug, and lots of researchers and patients had high hopes that it would be safe and effective.84 Diabetes is common, and more people develop the disease every year. Sufferers have poor control of their blood sugar, and diabetes drugs, alongside dietary changes, are supposed to fix this. Although it�s nice to see your blood sugar being controlled nicely in the numbers from lab tests and machines at home, we don�t control these figures for their own sake: we try to control blood sugar because we hope that this will help reduce the chances of real-world outcomes, like heart attack and death, both of which occur at a higher rate in people with diabetes.  Rosiglitazone was first marketed in 1999, and from the outset it was a magnet for disappointing behaviour. In that first year, Dr John Buse from the University of North Carolina discussed an increased risk of heart problems at a pair of academic meetings. The drug�s manufacturer, GSK, made direct contact in an attempt to silence him, then moved on to his head of department. Buse felt pressured to sign various legal documents. To cut a long story short, after wading through documents for several months, in 2007 the US Senate Committee on Finance released a report describing the treatment of Dr Buse as �intimidation�.  But we are more concerned with the safety and efficacy data. In 2003 the Uppsala Drug Monitoring Group of the World Health Organization contacted GSK about an unusually large number of spontaneous reports associating rosiglitazone with heart problems. GSK conducted two internal meta-analyses of its own data on this, in 2005 and 2006. These showed that the risk was real, but although both GSK and the FDA had these results, neither made any public statement about them, and they were not published until 2008.  During this delay, vast numbers of patients were exposed to the drug, but doctors and patients only learned about this serious problem in 2007, when cardiologist Professor Steve Nissen and colleagues published a landmark meta-analysis. This showed a 43 per cent increase in the risk of heart problems in patients on rosiglitazone. Since people with diabetes are already at increased risk of heart problems, and the whole point of treating diabetes is to reduce this risk, that finding was big potatoes. His findings were confirmed in later work, and in 2010 the drug was either taken off the market or restricted, all around the world.  Now, my argument is not that this drug should have been banned sooner, because as perverse as it sounds, doctors do often need inferior drugs for use as a last resort. For example, a patient may develop idiosyncratic side effects on the most effective pills, and be unable to take them any longer. Once this has happened, it may be worth trying a less effective drug, if it is at least better than nothing.  The concern is that these discussions happened with the data locked behind closed doors, visible only to regulators. In fact, Nissen�s analysis could only be done at all because of a very unusual court judgement. In 2004, when GSK was caught out withholding data showing evidence of serious side effects from paroxetine in children, the UK conducted an unprecedented four-year-long investigation, as we saw earlier. But in the US, the same bad behaviour resulted in a court case over allegations of fraud, the settlement of which, alongside a significant payout, required GSK to commit to posting clinical trial results on a public website.  Professor Nissen used the rosiglitazone data, when it became available, found worrying signs of harm, and published this to doctors, which is something that the regulators had never done, despite having the information years earlier. (Though before doctors got to read it, Nissen by chance caught GSK discussing a copy of his unpublished paper, which it had obtained improperly.85)  If this information had all been freely available from the start, regulators might have felt a little more anxious about their decisions, but crucially, doctors and patients could have disagreed with them, and made informed choices. This is why we need wider access to full CSRs, and all trial reports, for all medicines, and this is why it is perverse that Roche should be able even to contemplate deciding which favoured researchers should be allowed to read the documents on Tamiflu.  Astonishingly, a paper published in April 2012 by regulators from the UK and Europe suggests that they might agree to more data sharing, to a limited extent, within limits, for some studies, with caveats, at the appropriate juncture, and in the fullness of time.86 Before feeling any sense of enthusiasm, we should remember that this is a cautious utterance, wrung out after the dismal fights I have already described; that it has not been implemented; that it must be set against a background of broken promises from all players across the whole field of missing data; and that in any case, regulators do not have all the trial data anyway. But it is an interesting start.  Their two main objections � if we accept their goodwill at face value � are interesting, because they lead us to the final problem in the way we tolerate harm to patients from missing trial data. Firstly, they raise the concern that some academics and journalists might use study reports to conduct histrionic or poorly conducted reviews of the data: to this, again, I say, �Let them,� because these foolish analyses should be conducted, and then rubbished, in public.  When UK hospital mortality statistics first became easily accessible to the public, doctors were terrified that they would be unfairly judged: the crude figures can be misinterpreted, after all, because one hospital may have worse figures simply because it is a centre of excellence, and takes in more challenging patients than its neighbours; and there is random variation to be expected in mortality rates anyway, so some hospitals might look unusually good, or bad, simply through the play of chance. Initially, to an extent, these fears were realised: there were a few shrill, unfair stories, and people overinterpreted the results. Now, for the most part, things have settled down, and many lay people are quite able to recognise that crude analyses of such figures are misleading. For drug data, where there is so much danger from withheld information, and so many academics desperate to conduct meaningful analyses, and so many other academics happy to criticise them, releasing the data is the only healthy option.  But secondly, the EMA raises the spectre of patient confidentiality, and hidden in this concern is one final prize.  So far I have been talking about access to trial reports, summaries of patients� outcomes in trials. There is no good reason to believe that this poses any threat to patient confidentiality, and where there are specific narratives that might make a patient identifiable � a lengthy medical description of one person�s idiosyncratic adverse event in a trial, perhaps � these can easily be removed, since they appear in a separate part of the document. These CSRs should undoubtedly, without question, be publicly available documents, and this should be enforced retrospectively, going back decades, to the dawn of trials.  But all trials are ultimately run on individual patients, and the results of those individual patients are all stored and used for the summary analysis at the end of the study. While I would never suggest that these should be posted up on a public website � it would be easy for patients to be identifiable, from many small features of their histories � it is surprising that patient-level data is almost never shared with academics.  Sharing data of individual patients� outcomes in clinical trials, rather than just the final summary result, has several significant advantages. Firstly, it�s a safeguard against dubious analytic practices. In the VIGOR trial on the painkiller Vioxx, for example, a bizarre reporting decision was made.87 The aim of the study was to compare Vioxx against an older, cheaper painkiller, to see if it was any less likely to cause stomach problems (this was the hope for Vioxx), and also if it caused more heart attacks (this was the fear). But the date cut-off for measuring heart attacks was much earlier than that for measuring stomach problems. This had the result of making the risks look less significant, relative to the benefits, but it was not declared clearly in the paper, resulting in a giant scandal when it was eventually noticed. If the raw data on patients was shared, games like these would be far easier to spot, and people might be less likely to play them in the first place.  Occasionally � with vanishing rarity � researchers are able to obtain raw data, and re-analyse studies that have already been conducted and published. Daniel Coyne, Professor of Medicine at Washington University, was lucky enough to get the data on a key trial for epoetin, a drug given to patients on kidney dialysis, after a four-year-long fight.88 The original academic publication on this study, ten years earlier, had switched the primary outcomes described in the protocol (we will see later how this exaggerates the benefits of treatments), and changed the main statistical analysis strategy (again, a huge source of bias). Coyne was able to analyse the study as the researchers had initially stated they were planning to in their protocol; and when he did, he found that they had dramatically overstated the benefits of the drug. It was a peculiar outcome, as he himself acknowledges: �As strange as it seems, I am now the sole author of the publication on the predefined primary and secondary results of the largest outcomes trial of epoetin in dialysis patients, and I didn�t even participate in the trial.� There is room, in my view, for a small army of people doing the very same thing, reanalysing all the trials that were incorrectly analysed, in ways that deviated misleadingly from their original protocols.  Data sharing would also confer other benefits. It allows people to conduct more exploratory analyses of data, and to better investigate � for example � whether a drug is associated with a particular unexpected side effect. It would also allow cautious �subgroup analyses�, to see if a drug is particularly useful, or particularly useless, in particular types of patients.  The biggest immediate benefit from data sharing is that combining individual patient data into a meta-analysis gives more accurate results than working with the crude summary results at the end of a paper. Let�s imagine that one paper reports survival at three years as the main outcome for a cancer drug, and another reports survival at seven years. To combine these two in a meta-analysis, you�d have a problem. But if you were doing the meta-analysis with access to individual patient data, with treatment details and death dates for all of them, you could do a clean combined calculation for three-year survival.

This is exactly the kind of work being done in the area of breast cancer research, where a small number of charismatic and forceful scientists just happen to have driven a pioneering culture of easier collaboration. The summaries they are publishing represent real collaboration, between vast numbers of people, and on vast numbers of patients, producing highly reliable guidance for doctors and patients.  The process sheds a stark light on the reality of data collaboration on such a large scale. Here, for example, is the author list on an academic paper from the Lancet in November 2011: it�s reporting an immense, definitive, and incredibly useful metaanalysis of breast cancer treatment outcomes, using individual patient data pooled from seventeen different trials. The author list is printed in four-point font size (though I suspect that might go wrong in the e-book edition �) because there are seven hundred individual researchers named in it. I typed each of them in by hand for you.  This is what medicine should look like. An honest list of all the people involved, free access to information, and all the data pooled together, giving the most accurate information we can manage, to inform real decisions, and so prevent avoidable suffering and death.  We are a very, very long way away from there.  What can be done?  We urgently need to improve access to trial data. In addition to the previous suggestions, there are small changes that would vastly improve access to information, and so improve patient care.  ���1.�The results of all trials conducted on humans must be �����made available within one year of completion, in summary �����table form if academic journal publication has not occurred. �����This requires the creation of a body that is charged with �����publicly auditing whether or not trials have withheld results at �����twelve months; and primary legislation that is enforced, as a �����matter of urgency, internationally, with stiff penalties for �����transgression. In my view these penalties should include fines, �����but also prison terms for those who are found to be �����responsible for withholding trial data, as patients are harmed �����by this process.  ���2.All systematic reviews � such as Cochrane reviews � that draw �����together trial results on any clinical question should also �����include a section on the trials which they know have been �����conducted, but whose results are being withheld. This should �����state: which completed trials have not reported results; how �����many patients� worth of information there is in each unreported �����trial; the names of the organisations and the individuals who �����are withholding the data; the efforts the reviewers have made �����to get the information from them. This is trivial extra work, as �����review teams already attempt to access this kind of data. �����Documenting this will draw attention to the problem, and make �����it easier for doctors and the public to see who is responsible �����for harming patient care in each area of medicine.  ���3.�All clinical study reports should also be made publicly �����available, for all the trials that have ever been conducted on �����humans. This will be cheap, as the only costs are in finding one �����paper copy, scanning it and placing it online, perhaps with a �����check to remove confidential patient information. There is a �����vast mountain of highly relevant data on drugs that is currently �����being withheld, distorting what we know about treatments in �����widespread current use. Many of these documents will be �����sitting in the dry paper archives of drug companies and �����regulators. We need legislation compelling the industry to hand �����them over. Our failure to fix this is costing lives.  ���4.�We need to work on new methods for academics to extract �����summary information from these documents, as they are more �����detailed than published academic papers. The Cochrane group �����working on Tamiflu have made great progress here, learning as �����they go, and this field will need manuals.  ���5.�We should work towards all triallists having an obligation to �����share patient-level data wherever possible, with convenient �����online data warehouses,89 and streamlined systems �����whereby legitimate senior researchers can make requests for �����access, in order to conduct pooled analyses and double-check �����the results reported in published trials.  None of this is difficult, or impossible. Some of it is technical, for which I apologise. The field of missing data is a tragic and strange one. We have tolerated the emergence of a culture in medicine where information is routinely withheld, and we have blinded ourselves to the unnecessary suffering and death that follows from this. The people we should have been able to trust to handle all this behind the scenes � the regulators, the politicians, the senior academics, the patient organisations, the professional bodies, the universities, the ethics committees � have almost all failed us. And so I have had to inflict the details on you, in the hope that you can bring some pressure to bear yourself.  If you have any ideas about how we can fix this, and how we can force access to trial data � politically or technically � please write them up, post them online, and tell me where to find them.1Embed;

Psycho Killer - 2005 Remaster;Talking Heads;rock; I expect college to be a challenge. It may not be the most difficult challenge but it would be formidable. However, like any challenge I have faced it will be crushed.  I�ll have to learn new concepts that are at least new to me. I might be perplexed by the way the system functions. However, I have a general idea of how college will operate. I just don�t have all the details. Will I like the professor? Will I not? I don�t know much about it. I will have to find out. I know the expectations will be different than any typical high school. Also, some high schools are more challenging than college. I�ll have to adapt to the new environment and change my study habits. College could also be easy. I don�t know. I still have many questions and I�ll assume that they will be answered. I guess it will be a new adventure. I still don�t really know. It�s just another step up.  Even if I�m entering strange territory, I�m still confident; I�ll see what they throw at me. I know that we can request are classes to be spread out and if this is the case it will be easier because of the extra time per class. Whether it�s challenging or easy I�ll finish it.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.  �My mama always used to tell me: �If you can�t find somethin� to live for, you best find somethin' to die for,� � Tupac Shakur. My greatest influence is Tupac Shakur. His words have always resonated with me. I�ve looked up to him since I was a young boy. I credit my father for introducing me to my greatest role model outside of my family.  �A coward dies a thousand times, a soldier dies but once.� The best influence I gained from Mr. Shakur was to have a strong heart, will, and mind. With these things intact no way you can be deterred by anyone else. Letting someone break your down your heart to fight to can break your will. If you lose your will you can become weak minded and you need all three to survive. It�s like he always said, �If you can make it through the night, there�s a brighter day.� �I think I�m a natural-born leader. I know how to bow down to authority if it�s authority that I respect.� Another lesson I learned was to never give in to anyone and say what�s on your mind. The first amendment is the right to freedom of speech. Shakur believed that we all should exercise this right. He also believed that no badge of authority is just given respect but, it is earned just as anyone else will have to earn it. �Sh*t, I like to think that at every opportunity I�ve ever been threatened with resistance, it�s been met with resistance. And not only me but it goes down my family tree. You know what I�m saying, it�s in my veins to fight back.� It was in his blood to fight back that�s why he�ll never bow down to just any authority.  �I see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin�, I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I�m saying I made myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it�s time to make millions for myself; you know what I�m saying. I made millions for the record companies; I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us� here he says he worked and earned every penny he has and gained his respect along with it. Hard work gives you everything you deserve.Prompt: What makes you, you?  My life had many ups and downs, when I was a baby I was filled with smiles, laughed all the time, but that soon changed. I became an angry child or waterfalls of tears would run off may face during my child hood. Over time I learned to accept life, and then I learned to be happy. And I became a rosy cheek kid that tries to live an easy going life.  when I was a kid with a face as red as a burring flame on the sun and sad, it all seem to be tied to how my life was going, my father was arrested and I could only see him for short times compared to when I spent entire days with him. I started living with people I barely knew but my mom new quite well, these people where called grandparents. And the things I always knew where changing for the rest of my life and it was a lot for a kid of four to take in and, caused pain for many years.  Later in my life the streams if tears flowed so rapidly that soon I tried to make dams of rope at the line of the neck. My grandfather that I did not know as I child I learned to love like a second father had passed. So with the dames at a brake I knew it was time for a change. Whenever I would feel down I would search the ends of the earth to find the good in what is happening so that helped me learn how to except the negative thing that happen in my life. Once my grandfather passed who we depended on with most of our lives, poverty had soon come. We struggled to feed our self�s and we ended up having to move to a house a third of the size of what we once had. With that I learned to enjoy a loaf of bread instead of wanting a five course meal.  With all the challenges that happened in my life I grew to a bigger, stronger, and better person. Through my whole life the warmth of a mother hug and the kiss from the heart a grandmother gives when times seem blue helped me adapt the love and care I try to share with others. In the past I was a heated person temper as strong as an ox. But there is only so much anger a person can handle in their life and over time I became to be where only the biggest things can makes my blood boil. After having a past of anger and people who said I was weird and a nut, I decided to let it roll off the cheek and became determined to still be that nut but be the best I can, I adapted determination from that point on. Through the roller coaster of my life I�ve lived hard painful times, with loss of love ones and massive changes. And I�ve had good times as well with love and happiness. People would think on how I was as a child I would be this miserable adult but they were wrong. I am living proof that challenges as hard as they may come can make a better person. I was a dark souled being that changed into a great, loving and, caring person. Who is determined and fallows my dreams.Prompt: Describe an important transition in your life.  Since we were born we were told how important college is, we were told that we should already know what we want to do, and what college we want to attend. Even though we really don�t have any fore knowledge on what college really is, we are still expected to go. This, to me is the hardest transition anyone can face, making it the most important.  Figuring out what you want to be when you grow up, we have been asked this question ever since the beginning of public school, kindergarten. Isn�t it ridiculous? Asking a five year what he/she wants to do when she/he is 20. Back then we all were oblivious to how fast life really moves; we didn�t know that outside of crayons and story time, there was a world waiting to be explored. Even though we had no idea where money comes from, or how a government works, we were still asked, �what do you want to be when you grow up?� Present day, that question triggers anxiety, and pent up confusion, because the answer isn�t as simple as �rock star� anymore, now you need a real answer.  People say that high school is the best years of school you will ever have, because we can�t go back to it. Make your friends now, keep up with your grades, join school clubs, and get a part time job, pay your dues, graduate. It�s either now or never, go big or get a GED. Being pressured into going to college is probably the worst thing that can happen to anyone, it isn�t the 1960�s anymore, and we have other options. With tuition rising and employment decreasing, graduating college and getting a job is harder than ever, not to mention student loans.  That�s why I feel this transition is so important, it opens the eyes of our generation, and things aren�t easy. We�ve all been handed a crystal clear picture of going to college being the only thing we can do. Growing up happens fast, and this still goes for the lucky ones that already have an idea of what they want to do after high school. For us, graduation will be the strangest feeling, no more school, no more summer break, no more standardized tests, we will all be floating around in our cap and gown trying to grasp the fact that we are done. I think that�s when you actually become an adult, because; isn�t that what adulthood is? Just a bunch of kids trying to figure everything out. That�s what makes this transition an important one, because it�s the hardest one we will face.Prompt: Discuss some issue of personal, local, or national concern and its importance to you  Police Brutality is a national concern we need to put an end to. The people who are supposed to be protecting us are killing us! We the people must eliminate this racism and brutality in our police force. There is no time to waste action must be takin now.  Brutality is not the way anyone should go. Our right as a citizen must be protected at all times. Nobody is above our rights or laws. Black minorities are the main people targeted by this threat. Most people would�ve thought we�ve move passed this racism. Equality is what needs to be seen in the eyes of not just officers but everyone.  In my own experience I�ve seen white cops treat other races (Mainly Blacks) as if they were animals. We are no different than anyone else. Cops need to accept the fact that we are all the same on the inside. People are getting shot and killed for no reason. In the United States, major political and social movements have involved excessive force by police.Prompt:  �Describe a Person who has Influenced Your Life- Grandpa�  As the sun began to peak through the fine curtains, I clenched my eyes and inhale the sweet odor of homemade biscuits and smoky sausages specially made by my pleasurable grand-mama. My limps felt detached and strained but my stomach was roaring another tune, soon became in debate with worn-out body. I eased to the edge of the bed leisurely took a quick glance at the clock. I didn�t bother reading the time though; I just know it was too early to hear that faint bussing outside. It was Saturday morning and the routine remained the same as always, I shimmied over to the one window facing the back yard already knowing what I was searching for, my grand-daddy.  My grand-daddy wore a plaid red and black shirt, faded blue jean overalls and some dusty old work boot to mow the lawn in the early morning as, he rode his lawn mower from side to side and every few seconds he would briefly slowed down to spit his burnt sienna colored chewing tobacco, wipe his mouth with a bright white handkerchief and continue his journey.  My grand-daddy is the chief of the Totten family. Born and raised in Yanceyville, North Carolina. He received only a 5th grade education and from there worked in the family business of farmers. He is the second youngest of four brothers and a sister. Out of all of his siblings except his sister he was the only one to ever go to school and come out with a work ethic of devotion. He puts his all in everything he does from head to toe this man has gave honor to the Totten�s name.Prompt:  Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on me, and describe that influence. The one person who has changed my life the most has to be both of my brother�s for good and bad.  My brothers have had the most influence on me because I don�t want to be anything like at all. They both have been in and out of jail not for anything big like rape or murder but for dumb things like weed. But it�s not the fact that they went to jail that scary me and makes me not want to be anything like them but it the fact I seen everything that my mother has gone through because of brother�s and that�s what makes me want to be nothing like them fools.  So yea that�s why I don�t want to be anything like my bothers they are good for nothing that just mess things up in my life and everyone else life there even messing up your life right now you don�t even know it. But for real if anyone how had impacted my life it would be them for the fact that I don�t want to be like them. But then you could look at it for another point of view and say they actually are good because of their massive mistake now I wound not make the same mistake they did.Topic: The Place That I Know Well Texas is the place that I know well. I have been to Texas lots of times in my life. Texas is a great place to be at. There are lots of things that you can do in Texas. It is a place that you ca have a great time and also relaxes. It is the place that I know bather than anything else in the world.  Texas is where most of the things happen. You can feel the heat thrower your skin as you get closer to Texas. You can see lots of different things happening at the same time. Lots of cars passing by you as you go thrower the highway. There are lots of restaurant where you can eat at. You can small the different foods once you go inside the restaurant. Texas is as big as the United States.  Every time I go to Texas I just can just relaxes all day. I feel happy every time I go there. It is the place that can make you feel safe at all times. It is where I can see lots of things that can make you feel happy. For example every time I go to the beach I have a great time there. Also when I go to see family members and have a great time with them.Prompt: If you offered the role of the villain or the hero in a movie, which role would you accept and why?  Here come Jaeblast!! As the crowd would scream as I enter a nearby metropolis to save the day from evil. The role of a super hero is one role I would consider a choice of picking. Having superpower would be insane for me to decline that role because I would see myself as a protagonist and I believe I�m a good person by heart and soul.  I believe in superhero�s since the day I could open my eyes. As the year passed my inspiration for the famous superhero Flash has grown over time. Flash has been Favorable to me due to the fact that he was a scientist in his own field in which I�m going to college to study/Major in. Whenever I see or watch Flash I think of myself in a scientific/energetic way of thinking. The flash was a scientist before he was even notice as a hero of the comic books.Prompt: �Advice you can give to students just starting their high school career�  There are many advantages of going to high school and staying there for the full time that you should be there. At the same time there are many pitfalls and students can become confuse by the many decisions that we are forced to make. In most cases high school students want to make the best decisions about their future, and so it is important to learn of the various resources available to help make the right decisions as they will make an impact on life after high school.  There are many advantages of going to high school. High school will provide you with many opportunities that will help to develop life-long skills such as learning, social and mental development. High school helped me to lay down foundations for growth and development so that I can become a productive and good member of the community. The knowledge presented in high school can help build the necessary foundations for a career you may be interested in. Students can learn various subjects such as business, health, sciences, trades, skills and technology, all of which can be apply to knowledge needed for careers in these fields or other fields. Experiences in high school can also provide you with opportunities for career development. In high school students can meet partners in business, science, technology and other fields and they can learn about these careers and professions from experts in the field. In some high schools, experts come in on career day and talk to the students about the various careers and professions. I always love when they come in. These events can also help students to decide what careers they want to get into when the leave high school.  Another benefit is that going to high school helps students to build relationships with people such as teachers and other professionals in the fields already. When these professionals come in on career day, students can build professional relationships. You can get the experts as mentors and preceptors in the field. In high school you will also build relationships with each other and agree to go to college together. For me, I have very few friends that I can continue to be friendly with and hopefully go to college with. Some students would go to the same college and enter into the same or similar fields and in doing so long lasting friendly and work career relationships can be created. Another advantage in attending high school is that you get to learn about new methods and new technology in the workplace so that they can be more prepared when they leave school.  There are many resources in high schools that with help benefit students. High school will prepare students to make better decisions about careers and about colleges where they can advance and go into careers, or further studies that they may want to do. Sometimes, I am not sure what job or profession I want to do after I leave school. The guidance counselors in high school will hopefully help to guide and direct my career paths. Resources such as libraries, career centers, and academies like science academy or technology academy can help me to learn about these specific fields. Schools have resources such as the internet that I can use to learn more about colleges and careers. There are also many resources such as books, brochures and pamphlets that will tell me about careers and colleges.  While there are many advantages of going to high school and many resources to guide you, there are just as many pitfalls that can be misleading and dangerous. The large amounts of decisions that confront students can be overwhelming. Students may find pressure to make decisions and may rush into making decisions that they are not comfortable making. You might also rush and make decisions to please your parents. Sometimes I feel like I am being rushed by my mother to make a decision, but I have to remind her that I need to make my mind up. Another pitfall is that students could just be following their friends. Peer pressure could push students to make the wrong decisions for college, or peer pressure may force students to drop out of school. In high school you cannot cave into peer pressure. I had to make a personal decision for myself. High school students must be strong and make decisions best for themselves and their families. Another pitfall in high school is that students may become overwhelm by the many resources offered in school and that may result in the student not making the best and most timely decision.  To help with the pitfall that may occur in high school, I need to remain positive and seek the resources that will help me to do well and stay in school. Students should go to school and learn the school work. You should also do your homework and ask for help when needed. Students should go to their guidance counselors, or their teachers for additional help when necessary. Sometimes I feel uncomfortable asking for help. You need learn important skills like asking for help, talking with the teachers, being responsible and respecting to the teachers. These simple skills can help you to stay in school, do assignments and home work so you can get good grades, a good grade point average and meet all graduation requirements.  You should stay in school, so that you can graduate with good grades and then go on to further your education. Failure to remain in high school will result in poor grades, poor skills. If this happens, you will not get good grades, skills or knowledge that will help you to become a good person in the community. Therefore it is important to stay in school, use the resources, avoid the pitfalls and make the best decisions to stay in school.Prompt: Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that has special meaning to you.  Going to a different elementary school s every year or every other year wasn�t always easy. Living with that transition as a kid wasn�t easy at all to make friends. Events like birthday parties and having people over were always difficult to set up because I didn�t really have a group of base friends that I grew up with. Plus my parents are the type that they have to meet the others kids� parents for me to even come to a sleepover. Imagine being eight years old , walking into a new elementary school , not knowing a face in the school with butterflies in your stomach wondering how it�s all going to turnout . That was me at least four different times back in my elementary days. I would say the hardest task was to try and fit in. Every day was a new challenge to face because everyone knew each other and it was like I was the only crumbled cookie in a fresh new pack of opened Oreos. My teacher did try and make it better by doing all the introductions and trying to fit me in but I was still the odd ball in the pack. Plus as a kid was very timid, some would say anti-social, so that definitely didn�t help me. Honestly sometimes I even tried not to make friends because I knew I was going to end up moving.Prompt: Greatest challenge I have ever faced  Moving away from the place I was raised in and lived the most of my life was very hard for me and my family. It was scary, but at the same time it�s exciting to explore the new beginning of our life. My mind was thinking that if I move away from all my loved one and friends, I won�t be able to see them again and I�m afraid I won�t be able to make any new friends in United States.  After living in the Philippines for almostPrompt: �Discuss what makes you uniquely qualified for college�  College is the next essential step; it is also the most talked about after you finish high school. The reason college is known for being so hard is because high school graduates don�t really know what they want to be. People their age rarely know what they want to be. Myself I have spent countless hours discovering what I would like to accomplish. Anyone can say they want to do something; it takes some drive and execution to pursue something you enjoy. There are many cases where I could have quit and people would have loved to see me fail. At the end of all that I just had to remember why I was doing it, and was it worth fighting for. To prove them wrong I work hard for whatever it took a months or years. I just had to stay determined and put all my essential qualities to use.  High School is a rough time for some students. Students are figuring out what they want to become and finding out who they are. 50% � 70% of students change their majors at least once; most will change majors at least 3 times before they graduate. Not only knowing what you want to do is important, finding out whom you are necessary as well. Why is this important as a college student? Many students when they get to college don�t have the hard work and will power to continue. Students don�t know what works for them to be successful. I have spent many methods on how to plan and make myself successful.  Someone once told me that they�re a difference between listening and learning. Anyone can listen but only some can learn. It is the same concept on having idea/dream, and someone who peruses their aspirations. I had teachers before that told me that �You would not go anywhere�. The only thing the teachers didn�t know was I did not take their �advice� into consideration. I kept myself from going the wrong way. The steps I took were I did all I could do, and if I was failing behind I made up the work. I continuing doing well and showed my teachers wrong. I could have quit and not cared but I was motivated because I had a goal to achieve.  Hard work over weights anything I notice that hard work is like practice. Everyone knows the saying that �Practice makes perfect�. No matter how bad you are at something the amount of time I�ve practice takes an effect. I have put so much hard work into school. That I�m ready for a new challenge college is that next step. I have prepared my whole life to get this opportunity. With all the knowledge I have learn from preparing and my high school practice college I am ready for college.  With all the things I have learned during my school years and my life lessons. I have learn a lot of new thing and will look forward to learning new things in college.Prompt: �Describe an important transition in your life�  It was my first year of high school. I was excited and nervous at the same time I was excited because it was a new beginning for me. It what significant to me because it was a big change for me. I was going from middle school to high school.  The alarm goes off it is now 5:00 a.m. it is time for me to get ready for school. I get off my bed and go brush my teeth then go into in to the shower. The water was freezing cold. When I got out the shower I rushed to my room and start getting ready. The time flew by so quickly. I got ready on time. I had few minutes before I had to go to the bus stop. I ate some cereal before leaving. Once, I left to bus stop I was walking with my sister. I arrived at the bus stop it was near the road where the cars were passing. The wind was blowing in my face because of the cars racing in the road. I could see the red lights flashing on the bus. The bus is getting near I start shaking and my hands are getting sweaty. I get on the bus and it feels as if I was walking into an oven it was hot.  Furthermore, we are getting near the school and I get afraid. I don�t know what is it like to be in high school and it will be a new experience for me. We finally arrive at school. There are many buses there also. Suddenly, they yell out �unload� when they say that it means to open the door and let us out of the bus. Everyone starts rushing off the bus and I am patiently waiting for my turn. I get off the bus and start walking into the school. I walk in the school and there are lots of people. I am squeezing in between the crowd. I finally walk through everyone and it is time to look for my classes. I think to myself I don�t know where my classes are the good thing is that there were teachers in mostly each corner. I got to all my classes. I would look around to see if I had any friends in that class. Luckily, I had at least one friend in each class. I just wanted the day to be over as soon as possible. The thing that got me nervous was that my sister would always tell me, �high school is not easy.� The first day isn�t that bad because the only thing we do is get informed of what we will expect and our expectations and what we will learn during the year.  Additionally, for me the transition from middle school to high school was a big change for me. The reason being is because I was already getting use to walking up later like around 7:00 a.m. Then, the following year having to wake up at 5:00 a.m. was a change. I had to get use to waking up at that time. It was hard because the first days I would wake up at the right time then, I would go back to sleep. I missed the bus a few times. I managed to get over that with time. The only thing I didn�t like is that I had seven classes. The other thing was that the classes were very apart from each other. For example, I had to walk from one building to another one in five minutes. Overall, I liked all my classes. For me high school was easy as long as I did my work. They start getting us ready for college.Prompt: �Discuss the greatest challenge you have face or expect to face�  Challenge? What is a challenge? It�s something that you have to accomplish or something you have to face. Well everyone has challenges. Small ones, big ones but I never thought I would face the biggest one ever. That is my dad death. I had no idea it was going to happen that fast. So that�s the biggest challenge I have to face in my life. It was so unexpected I have to face. My life has change since that day.  It began on June 30, 2014 that afternoon. I was hanging out with my friend Stefany. It was a great day. She left to go home. I went inside to my room. Then my mom got a call from my aunt. She told her that my dad had passed away. She came to my room. She told me and my sister that my dad has passed away. When I heard the bad news tears where rolling down my face. I had to call my older brother to tell him the news. He answers and when I told him. He was like your lying I�m like no I�m not. It was grandma all over. We went to see him in the hospital. It was the hardest thing I have to face to see. I almost fell to the ground and one of my aunts caught me. All the family was full of sadness and we couldn�t accept it. Later on that week it was his funeral. It was on Wednesday July 2, 2014. In the memorial service we were crying our tears out. When my family saw him it was horrible that we have to see him like that. During the service the ladies sung this song call �Yo Te Extranare� which it means I�ll miss you. That song is a dialogue of me and my dad talking. Every time listen to that song I always cry and be in pain, because it reminds me of him. Ever since the funeral nothing would make be happy.  On that Saturday that week. We had this church event which took place in the park that my dad would always take me. That was also the park behind where my grandma and dad work. That day memories just came to me and tears came out too. So I walk around and cry my eyes out. When I was walking around. My mom was telling the people from church that my dad died that week. And she also told them that I was the most effected about it. Anyways ever since my dad passed away my life change a lot. All my friends ask me how you can live life still without your dad. I�m like I just don�t think about as much. Ever since then I haven�t been the same girl that I used to be. My religious beliefs change and so has my personalities. I�ve suffering for my dad death and for something else I can�t say. Every time I�m going somewhere. Something always reminds me of him and my memories come back. Oh also when I go to my grandpa house. I always think my dad is going to be there even though I should know he�s not there. I just can�t accept that he�s gone. My family and my friends say �It�s okay [...] your dad is now in peace and not suffering�. I�m like �No now I�m the one suffering �. I wanted him to see me graduate and see I made it. He saw my brother graduate and now he won�t see me. He would always tell me when he was here. �Ya me voy a morir� Which means I�m going to die. I hated that he would always say that. I would tell him �Pa no tengas eso� which means �Dad don�t say that�. So my life has complete became a suffering life. As can be seen life is so short. I want to live my life. Since my dad is no longer here I want him to know I�m doing everything so I would be successful. I want to become a writer, singer, and also an actress. He�s the only person that supported me on what I wanted to do with my life. So when I become one of those dreams of mine. I own it all to my dad. He made me what I am now and I want to accomplish everything I need to do. Now I�m not suffering as much for his death because I know he�s not suffering. And soon I would be with him. So this was the greatest challenge I have to face and still facing.Prompt: What are the three specific things you plan to do in Florida?  The three specific things I plan to do at Florida is focusing on class, basketball, and wanting on to become a more responsible person. I want to build the best educate for me. Be known as one of the best student �athlete who came to Florida State. To be known to teachers on my skills of focus. To be remember as an elite player that played the game. To be one of the best player on and off the court.  My focus is coming to Florida with a good mindset. My study habits would be up to par while in the hot steaming room with no A/C. my sweat would fall off my forehead like bullet shells. As I try to write a perfect paper. As I am proof reading the paper for the professor to receive the fulfilling grade of success.  As I�m done with my work for class I head to the gym with coach and the guys. As we practice on our plays for the games. While me and the team breathe hard with exhaustion. The coaches would let us take a break and drink a cold bottle of Gatorade. While we drink and take a break we discussed about getting the sunny beach college sate a championship.  As we end practice I�ll go off campus to go work and find a way to stay productive. To stay on the right path and let others go on the wrong. As I drive on the smooth road with the bright glowing sun hits my face. I would go out to find a job and make some more money to pay for books and food to live on. Then after work I�ll go to the donation and give the clothes that I don�t wear any more. I would clean up the streets of Florida to help the community out with a place to claim for good and clean areas.Prompt: Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that has a special meaning to you.  Many people have achieved different things in their lives. Some have achieved to get scholarships. Other where able to go pro in a sport they loved. There are a lot of achievements that people have been able to accomplish. A significant experience or achievement that has a special meaning to me is when I made it to Varsity Cross-Country.  The first time that I joined Cross-Country I saw that there were many good runners. That inspired me to try to be the best runner for the team. I attended practice every day and gave it all I had. But one of my biggest obstacles that was stopping me from being the best was my knee pain. My knee pain was really bad and that was slowing me down big time. Therefore my sophomore season wasn�t the best; I wasn�t able to become the best runner for Berkmar.  After I did therapy for my knee and I relaxed my joins I went back to running. But this time I did something different that I dint do the first time, I went to summer conditioning. Summer conditioning helped me out big time to become better and achieve my goal. I ran all summer long with the team; luckily I wasn�t having any knee pain. After summer conditioning finished our Cross-Country season started again. I was determined to achieve my goal that year. Two weeks into the season and we had our first race of the year. After getting an 18:29 for a 3.1 mile race I knew I was on track to achieving my goal. I kept working hard to get even better and by the time you know it I was top varsity for Berkmar High School. I finished that year with my best time of 17:52.  This year I am setting a new goal. That goal is to beat my personal record that I set last year. I�m going to put even more work in and I�m going to try more hard to achieve that goal. I know that I focus on my goal I�ll be able to reach it. The goal I am setting for this season it to run a 17:00 flat or less if possible.  My main goal that I had was been to become a varsity runner. That goal has been accomplished, now I have to set new goals so I can keep making accomplishments in life. A new goal I have is to beat my personal record of 17:52 and hopefully get a Cross-Country scholarship. Overall the achievement that has a special meaning to me is the fact I was able to become varsity for Berkmar High School.Prompt: �Evaluate a significant experience or achievement that that has special meaning to you.�  One of the greatest achievements is to graduate and fulfill all the dreams and goals that I have set for myself. This world is full of people that had set goals, and dreams but never did anything to make them come true. I don�t want to be one more of those people that don�t do anything to not make them; I will do whatever it takes just to make it happen. I want these not only for myself but I part for my family. They have been there sense day one and I appreciate all their support.  Why do I say that I don�t only want it for me but for my family? Because, my family has been there for me without thinking about it twice, they have had my back, no matter what they will always be there. They push me to do my very best all the time, and tell me every time that I should never stop fighting for what I want, if I want it to go for it. Even when the get too pushy and very stressful I know they don�t do it to frustrate me they do it because they care and want me to do good in life and even though I feel like they pressure me sometimes I know it�s because they care.  By me graduating and entering college, would be the best achievement ever not only because I prove myself that I could do but because I would be making my mom prude, and for all of those people that didn�t have faith in me or never believe that I could have done it. I want to give the best I have and be successful. My mother is one thing that push me the most to do good, and I want to make her proud and show her that I can do it, and by that I will be giving her back a little out of all that she has gave me.  That is the main achievement that I have in mind, the one that is going to take me far in life the one that I�m going to be proud to say that I made it and that I did it all by myself, with hard effort but I made it. Everybody is born with a purpose in life, I know mine. Now the only thing I have left is to get to it and do anything it takes to get it done.Think of a place you know well. Describe the place and include feelings about it.  Have you ever wanted to go back in time, and visit that one place that brings a smile to your face? Meanwhile that exact place is so far from your reach, and on the other hand it�s extremely close to your heart. When I think of that place I only imagine Guatemala. There are three areas in Guatemala that I enjoy tremendously which are in some ways very different and similar at the same time. Venecia, Guatemala is one of these areas that I adore to stay at. Primarily I�m fondled at the fact that my mom was born around this district. Also her parents and my grandparents still live there to this day. Every time I go spend time over there I fancy walking through the high stalks of green corn and getting lost for hours with my little cousin Yasmin. Another thing I�m delighted by is the morning breeze hugging my skin so tight that goose bumps appear throughout by body. Evenings were even better; my grandmother would stir up a cup of coco for my sister and me and included bread on the side to make the experience even more outstanding. I won�t ever forget the time when my sister and I put ten baby chicks in a circle and surrounded them with something. After a few seconds we would lift that something and the chicks would run in every direction. The place was to collect each one of the chicks until we got ten again. This specific moment made me feel butterflies and fireworks inside my tummy. Every single time I go to visit the moment is extremely pleasant and unforgettable. My heart speeds up every time I am able to go to Guatemala.  Another place I�m exited in Guatemala to spend time at is chela. Chela is located near the city. It�s three hours from the city but a hot sweaty three hours in the car. My mom�s little brother Rudy lives there in a two story home. I love going there because I get to share moments with my baby cousin. I remember once my brother, sister and I went to a water park like thirty minutes away. My eyes almost popped out of my head once I saw the price of each ticket. Each one of us had to pay one hundred quetzals, which is the name of the currency in Guatemala. In U.S currency it would vary from fourteen to fifteen dollars. The money didn�t really bother me at the end of the day. I saw huge slide with people shouting and screaming. The one ride that is unforgettable to me was the one where all three of us got into one float and were pushed in a giant swirling slide and we at got wet and at the end of the slide was a pool where we fell into. My heart was racing the entire time we were there. After the water park we headed back to my uncle�s house where we ate a fish that was whole and looking at me. This started to make my stomach to move from the smile on my face. After a few weeks my other grandparents, my dad�s parents came to pick my sister and I up to go stay with them until the day we had to come back to Georgia.  My father�s parents live the closest to the city. Its one and a half hours away. The interesting part of Chimaltenango, Guatemala is that it�s always mid-warm there and I love the sun beating against my skin. I adore helping out in my grandfather�s store where he basically sells everybody�s needs. The benefit of being his granddaughter was that I basically owned his store as well. What I mean by that was I could take anything and pig out on whatever I craved. Luckily that wasn�t the only thing to do at their house. At times I would help my grandma water all her crops such as bananas,plantans,mangosPrompt: A person that who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.  They say �Never Judge A book by Its Cover �, but why does everyone still judge me because of the carrier I want to take or the job I would love to have. People are always telling me what to do and what is best for me, but I don�t want what happen to my cousin happening to me. I really want to be a doctor�s assistants and I will be because I have the skills for it.  My cousin always wanted to travel the world, but her parents never let her do what she wanted to do with her life, since they were the ones who were paying her college and her books. People and family members would always judge her because they thought she would never get to that level since most of us were poor. She knew that one day she was going to be traveling to many countries, and luckily the United States government sent a letter to her school asking for a voluntary helper to go to out the country and help others. When everyone doubt it her, she always believed in herself.  From the time I was able to realize that the U.C (University Of California) was the best for me and my future, I decide to do my research on it.2nd PeriodPrompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.  Through out the good and the bad and the ugly she has been there. When i was sick feeling like i was on my death bed,she was there. When i just plainly need someone to talk to or a friend she was always there. That person is my mom. My mother has made the greatest influence on my life out of everyone i have know to this day. Throughout all the struggle she, me and my family as a whole she has been there and she was the one to keep it all together and kept a smile on her face even when she felt like she could just leave ,she stayed and fought through it all. She was my mother.  My moms name is Yezzet Lewis Thomas. She is a Licensed Practical Nurses or LPN and she is working on her RN degree (Registered Nurses). Born in France moved to the United States when she was 2 and has 9 brothers and sisters her family was a military family with her dad serving in the military. One reason i chose her to be my biggest influence on me is the fact she was always there for me. when i was younger from Elementary to Middle school I had a really hard time making friends and had lots of issues with me being bullied and my constant stutter did not make it any better from my point of view, It just gave others more ammo to fire at me day after day and i struggled with life. But i always knew i could come home and wait to 8 o'clock the time she gets off of work and just talk to her about it like she was my best friend. She was always on my side and when i needed stuff done school wise she would stay up late to help me even if she had to go back to work at 6 in the AM.Describe an important transition in your life.  My name was not called to participate in the 2014-2015 Peachtree Ridge, three day soccer tryouts. The coach said, �we do not have your physical on file�, but yet I turned mine in to the lady soccer adviser and she said she will put it in the day I gave it to her a week before. The JV coach told me to ask Coach Sutton, the Varsity coach, to see if I can still tryout. When I walked over to him, and informed him on the situation, he looked me up and down looking at how I was dressed, I am new to the soccer world so I had some; black vans, shorts and two hoodies on, that day was the day it started to snow, and he said, �well if it is not on file then I will not let you tryout.� I was outside for hours just practicing in the cold after school, from 2:10 to 5:00. Being told in front of the whole soccer team and new comers, that you can�t tryout, is embarrassing, and it really hurts you. I knew I turned in my Physical Form but they �did not have it�. Later on that day of the tryouts, my mom emailed Coach Sutton, and informed him that I did turn it in to the Soccer Lady. So the Coach replies saying that I am able to come to the second day tryout and I will be evaluated closely during the tryout. I told my mom no, I will not go to the tryout because I will feel the pressure and know they are watching me closely, I also did not want not meet their standers and still not make the team. Plus, I did not have much experience to the game of soccer, so I thought it would be best of me to not go and work on my skills for the game till next year.  So from the day after the second tryout, I was practicing soccer left and right, outside working on ball control, my touches, juggling, and at parks working on my shooting. I have improved a lot from the tryouts. I am glad that I decided to go off and improve my skills, I am more confident to tryout now, but still will be nervous and feel the pressure. I moved schools my last year of high school, to Berkmar High school and I am trying out this year, I will be attending Conditioning, did not do it at Peachtree Ridge, but I will now. Seniors have to try out for Varsity and juniors too and then sophomores and freshman have to try out for JV. So I will be preparing myself for Varsity tryouts, and the Varsity Coach, is also my Psychology teacher. He knows I am trying out for soccer and has been informing me the updates on soccer. I got my physical done and now I am just getting myself ready for conditioning.  My future career goals with soccer, is to make it to an MLS (Major League Soccer) Team. MLS is only teams held in The United States, so American Teams. I have a few teams in mind, for example; Orlando FC, New York City, New York City Red Bulls and LA Galaxy. In 2017, Georgia will have their own MLS team, I would like to try them out first.  So ever since that day after tryouts, I have opened my mind to soccer, learned more about soccer and would to take it up a notch in my life. I may not be much good but all I can do from then and to the future is practice.Prompt: Discuss What Makes You Uniquely qualified for This Position  Not everyone is qualified for every job or career. I know I have the potential to be a police officer. Wearing the blue is not the easiest or most popular position right now but I am motivated to do it. Having the dream is the first step to a goal. However, having certain capabilities is also key to success in performing specific tasks. I am very perceptive so I can notice elements that are out of the ordinary that may disrupt society and I also possess a sense of justice to act out this role. I can see myself right now in the uniform and looking out across the street. Perception is a necessary skill for all law enforcement. Without it, criminals would continue to wreak havoc and no one will be any the wiser. If a situation seems off, I will notice. I know the symptoms of being under the influence of hard drugs: drowsiness, hyperactivity, sweating, irritability, paranoia. Liars will not fool me either. I will note the delay and uncertainty in a person�s response and the many gestures that accompany deceit. Then I will politely ask for the truth. There is another sense that is required for this position.  A sense of justice is a key component to upholding the law. The privilege of safeguarding other people can corrupt. Many act as if they are the rulers of the land but I would consider myself a servant of society. Abusing power is unthinkable to me. There are government workers who accept bribes and practice favoritism. I would treat all citizens as equals, not favoring the rich, a gender, or any particular ethnicity. This country is founded on principles of equality and should be enforced by only the fair-minded.  Professions require a certain set of skills. Applicants that want to be police officers are weeded out first for the incapable. I have astute skills to notice illegal and abnormal activities and I also have a clear sense of justice. I know I will pass the training and perform well in the field. In the not too distant future, I will assist in keeping the country, the city, the people in uniform.Prompt: ? I was born in Guatemala. When I was about five years old my mother contacted some people and I�ve lived in Georgia ever since. Growing up was a real struggle. Bills were paid late, sometimes there was no dinner for me and my siblings, and eventually we would relocate to a different apartment. This happened several times until money was no longer an issue and we moved into a humble house. My brother had it the worst out of the three kids my mom had. There was always the language barrier, but he was lucky since the school actually bumped him up a grade. Even with all the stress he managed to graduate. My sister was a total different story, however. Greilyn was always involved in extracurricular activities, and throughout her high school years she had at least one Advanced Placement class. She would juggle sleep, homework, sports, and after school clubs all at once. She wasn�t able to attend college because she didn�t have legal papers at that time. My brother, my sister and I were able to get a worker�s permit two years ago and my sister and brother were able to get a stable job. Both Heber and Greilyn moved to Florida, my brother with his wife and my sister with her husband.  Family problems arose back at home. When I was in seventh grade I started to miss a lot of days in school. Some teachers told me I wouldn�t get anywhere in life and that�s where I stopped caring about anything that had to deal with school. This was when life knocked the teeth straight out of my mouth. I would have mental breakdowns time after time. In the 10th grade, I barely passed the first semester and I failed four classes the second. When I got to my junior year in high school I realized how important school really was and I made a life plan to become a mechanical engineer. I moved to Florida with my sister for the first semester of 11th grade and that�s where I recovered my lost credits. I went from taking advanced classes to standard classes in less than a year. I didn�t give up there and I�m still here standing. I know my story is merely one of thousands, but nothing would mean more to me than being the first in my family to go to college and prove to myself that I am no failure. I have always believed that one cannot get back up if they have never fallen. I�m grabbing life by the horns and taming the raging beast. This is only the beginning, for one day I will also prove the world, and those who doubted me, that I [...] am a successful college graduate.As the window bust from the hard wind I Can feel the the heat rise as the flames spread extremely rapidly from the garage to the living room. The flames started in the garage it was caused by the wires in the walls the Fire department said it was an electrical fire. I can remember the harsh smell of wood burning that made my stomach ache. The heat of the fire felt liked when you open the oven after a long time of preheating. One of My Greatest challenges that I faces was my house burning to the ground in the spring of 2007. This experience Changed my life completely it showed me things about family and friends, Showed me to Value things more, but it also made life harder. It was 11:48Pm on a Wednesday night everybody was asleep except my brother he was up watching TV when he notice a burning smell coming from down stairs, he rushed to see where it was coming from when he notice the garage was in flames, He run upstairs panicking to wake everybody up. Once he thought everybody was up the flames was already spreading more and more. As we try and put on our shoes we hear window bursting one by one. We all rushed towards the front door were you could barely see anything because the house was filled with black smoke, as I inhaled the smoke I remember getting lite headed jumping out the fire. Then once everybody was out we notice my baby brother didn�t make it out. The fire man said it was too risky for anybody to go back in the house, even the fire marshal gave up on him. My older brother wasn�t going for it he broke loose from the fire man and ran fast thru the back yard to the back door and up the stairs as he heard my brother scream for help. He yells to my brother to just roll down the stairs. He rolls down the stairs and he and my baby brother jumped out the house together as soon as they jumped out the whole entire house collapse. My brother had 3rd degree burns in many places. They Fire department called him a miracle because they never seen somebody make it out a house like that. My family lost everything, 5 dogs all our clothes shoes furniture and pictures everything. At the end of the night we were placed in a hotel for those whom didn�t have a house. We stayed in a hotel for about 2 months until we finally moved back to Chicago for 2 months to stay with my grandma.  After the fire everything was different crying myself to sleep every night waking up in tears having nightmares of that night, I felt like I was reliving it all over again night by night, Not going to school every day because we had no clothes or shoes. When my house burnt down I left my best friend she stayed in that neighborhood she was the only person to know and understand. At that time I didn�t care about school at all. Going to school and people asking about was the worst. People making fun of me because I didn�t have a house I hated school just because of that. Nobody could understand what I was going thru at a young age. Moving from hotel to hotel school to school I went to 5 different elementary schools a different school every year. Having to make new friends every year was hard being insecure of my situation to tell people was the hardest. I used to go to school just to go not even caring about it. Until my 5th grade year and I meet this teacher who was so cooled and I could talk to her bout everything and she made me realize school is what I need. She taught me I can just write my hurt and my problems out with poetry or just start writing when I�m upset.  As time moved on things started getting better, we started getting our life back together. Started building a home back together getting everything back to normal, even though it was hard and we struggled but my mom always managed to get it done. We noticed family wasn�t always there for you when you need them. It was us by ourselves against everything all the problems with no help, even my mom mother wasn�t there after time went back. It showed us life can be gone in a blink of an eye. After that it made us stronger and closer as a family. It made us strive harder to get everything we wanted and once had because we lost it all in one night. It showed me that I need an education to be successful in order to get everything I want.Prompt: The lessons we take from failure can be fundamental to later success. Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what did you learn from the experience?  High school is a great stepping ground for young adults to experience responsibility, freedom and to prepare themselves for college and the work field. Everyone makes mistakes but it�s up to you to correct them and better the situation.  Having responsibilities is a huge thing to have. You always have to stay focused and on top of things. My freshmen year in high school I failed second semester Biology. I didn�t know how I was going to be able to make it up so that I could still graduate on time and have a good college look at me. I went to my counselor to ask her about any programs that the school offered for kids that failed classes. She offered me a chance to do a afterschool program called Credit Recovery. The program was $100 for two weeks and class was 3 hours long. Having to do Credit Recovery for those two weeks I still had to say on top of doing my classwork for school and working. Me failing Biology set me back but also made me realize how much school Is important to me and just how badly I wanted stay focused and do the right thing.  Freedom can help or set you back in life, it�s up to you to keep everything in order and to still do what you�re supposed to do. For example wanting to go out with your friends, instead of studying for a quiz. I honestly thinkPrompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.  From a young age my grandparents were always on my butt to go in a straight line, to stay focus, and to never do something I would regret in the future. My grandparents always had a huge influence in my life. To this day I can never be any more grateful to have them. The example they set is the example I want to set to the lower classmen.  From 5 in the morning to 6 afternoons, Monday thru Friday they would come with tiredness written all over their face. Just knowing they�re busting their butts just so I can go to school and knowing I don�t have to worry about anything. Because of them I want to strive for success, I want to be someone with a doctor�s degree or a business degree, just something that they could be proud of. I was given an opportunity that wasn�t given to my grandparents and that was an education.  I�ve face situations where dropping out was the easy way out, but why quit when I�m so close to getting a diploma, why quit on something my grandparents would be so happy about, why let them down, why not graduate so they can tell their friends and family that they raised a successful kid, a kid that didn�t give up. My grandparents would tell me � if you want to be successful go for it, we would be by your side; nothing stopping you from being someone important in life.�  It�s my senior year and its crazy to think that I made it this far, I�m the only one in my family that�s about to graduate, I�m breaking a curse that�s been in my family for generations. My grandparents are the reason for me to finish my education. Every day I would get lectured about what kind of life I would have if I don�t finish high school, I don�t want to be behind a lawn mower working 11 hours a day in the heat. Having an education open so many doors for different opportunities in the future.Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face  Everyone has a challenge that they expect to face. My greatest challenge that I expect to face is going to college and being successful in the future. Those are my greatest challenge because it is not going to be easy. I am going to have to put a lot of effort and not mess up. Once you mess up it is very hard to get back up, and since it is about your future than it is very important to not make that mistake.  It is not going to be easy because colleges do not just accept anybody. They require much information such as the SAT or the ACT. Which are a test that every college requires, and you have to meet the average point or above. Also a certain point of GPA and above, resume and other important requirements. College is the real thing, it is more freedom and that is where you already know what you want to do in life. You have your mind set on your career and at that moment you already know what you should do and expect to do.  To be successful in my future I have to do something I enjoy doing and that gets me good money for it. I want to do entrepreneur, because I want to have my own business. I do not like it when people boss me around. Therefor if I study entrepreneur I would be the one bossing people around and they would work for me. I enjoy that because it something I like to do and I have always wanted to have my own business. In college I want to study entrepreneur, but it would not be easy. Even though it would not be easy I would not give up, it would be a great challenge for me.  College is the time to get your things together and start working extra hard. It is not going to be easy but one should not give up. It would be extremely stressful and hard but that is just how college is. I am the type of person that gets distracted easily so I paying attention in college with no distractions would be a challenge. I would have to set up goals and learn how to accomplish each one of them. When you set up goals you have to be determined and find a way to achieve them. It is a lot to do but it is something I expect to face.Prompt: The greatest challenge I am expected to face.  As a child I had almost everything handed to me. What I would ask for I received, I had six pets for crying out loud. As time prevailed getting what I wanted when I wanted wasn�t so easy anymore. Now it�s my last year of high school and it could not be any more stressful than it is now. It�s the last first day of high school I am struck with �senioritis� as soon as I walk through those double doors. Saying to myself �I can�t wait to graduate and get this year over with�. By May all of this will be over and I�ll be left to my own devices, by May all my friends would have moved on ,and I�ll be stuck thinking to my self what�s next? By May my time would be upPrompt: Discuss a place that has changed you.  It�s a shame how few people choose not to go to college. I plan on going to college and have a bright future. One particular school I�ve been seeking is Morehouse. I plan on attending a school with a positive environment and fair rules. I have learned unique history and facts about the school as well.  Not too long ago I visited Morehouse College my sophomore year. I was in this mentoring program called BEAMERS we went on a field trip to visit the school. This experience changed me. I remember stepping off that rusty bus into the quiet school. The halls were silent and echoed every step you took. The lunch room smelled like a 5-star restaurant. I said to myself: �I�d love to attend this school�.  As soon as we made it to the college we sat in a class room then talked to a student that attends Morehouse. He told us the GPA requirements, which was a 3.7 at the time. He explained Morehouse is a private, four-year, historically black college. We were also informed that Morehouse was an all-male school. This statement was a shock to many including myself. The crazy thing was Spelman College was right across the street from Morehouse. Spellman was an all-female school. The student informed us with much information about the school but our tour was nowhere finished.  The best part about our tour was coming up next. The student informed us with unique history of the school. There is an obelisk named in honor of Howard Thurman. Thurman was an African American author, philosopher, theologian, educator and civil rights leader. He was a graduate of Morehouse College. There were many other celebrities that graduated from this school such as Spike Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Martin Luther King Jr. Martin Luther King was enrolled at more at the age of 15 after skipping the 9th & 12th grade. These unique facts went on and on like a broken record.  Ever since the Morehouse tour I�ve never been the same. I met the requirements to this college. I would be more than happy to attend it. I hope ever school high school gets to tour this college. It is truly a life changing experience.Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face.  Throughout my entire life challenges have been with me from the beginning. No matter what I have faced challenges and been expecting to face more that are thrown my way. Without dealing with these situations in life I don�t think I would be as successful as I am now. Challenges to me are basically things to where I have to push myself in order to go where I want to go. Plus learning how to never give up and stay at the task at hand.  The greatest challenge I expect to face in life is getting my mom and brother a bigger house and a better lifestyle for them. I really expect to do all that through basketball as a matter of fact and I have a great feeling that I will be able to accomplish this as well. Basketball is really my wife in this world because I have become so phenomenal at it that I have been attending colleges and camps. The only reason for me even wanting to play is because my little brother looks up to me and he wants to see me make it big for the family. In the future as I finish up high school, I expect to have matured well enough to be ready for college and hoping that I will be succeeding in that as well. I already know that for me challenges will forever come my way but as a humble human being I will never complain. I�m going to always push myself to get better at what I love and loving something I always wanted to do.  The other challenge I expect to face is trying to find the college that�s right for me and depending on how great of a school they are education wise and activity wise. I have visited colleges any basketball or any other athlete can ever dream of. My recent visits have been North Carolina or UNC, Kentucky, Birmingham Southern, Georgia State, FAMU, Florida State University, Georgia State, Louisville, Georgia Tech, University of Georgia, and that�s pretty much it. For me visiting those schools it took a lot of hard work to get there and that�s not even including sports wise really. Those colleges expect major things from kids attending, and I can get really lazy so it will take me some time to bypass all of that. A college I was really considering going to was Florida State University. With that being a highly attended school in the country they acquire kids to be outstanding scholars. For me to get in there I have to do exceptionally well in high school as of now since I�m a senior. Because if I didn�t loiter around in my freshman and sophomore year, I wouldn�t have to worry about much as a senior. But that is a challenge I am facing at this moment and I know I can overcome it. Especially knowing people are here to support me as I continue on with the success I�m at I know I�ll be okay.  That is really the greatest challenge I have faced in my life because there were days to where I just wanted to give up and stop playing basketball all together. But I had to come to my intellectual gift and do what I what destined to do as my heart desired. Another Challenge I expect to face is overcoming my laziness and putting forth the effort as I am told to do so. But I have overcome that already but if I want to get in a successful college at this moment of life I got to just get through it. Another college I was looking forward to coming to see was Tennessee. I wanted to consider them on my list because their high school requirements aren�t as major as Kentucky and so on. But it will still be a big obstacle for me to get into. Plus their courses have to meet my needs because I wouldn�t want to attend if they aren�t as good as I thought. But there are a lot of athletes in my shoes and especially professional athletes as a matter of fact. So really it doesn�t bother me knowing I have to face a colossal obstacle at hand.Prompt: ?  The high way a never ending sees of concrete and steel. My hands dire and tit on the old polished letter wheal my first day on the road. I stop pull over and scream not in anguish but it in nervous excitement over my future I was going to university to some no surprise to others dis belief. My interest confused and angered my friends and some family I wanted to become a geneticist something never herd of by my pears. Growing up in Canada theirs a wall much greater than in the states not racial not nationalist theirs was a learning wall my wall from the time I could remember I had trouble with words not on the page but in my mind. I could read and understand words with the best of them but the second I was told to write my mind went a blank not with ideas but in how I could put them on paper I couldn�t spell. I was put in to �special education� or prison school for short I was hindered broken not rite my self-esteem was crashed and my life in question I was lost. We moved I thought it was over I thought I was free I was wrong the same thing for four years till the 7 and 8 grade my case manager wanted to test me. This was my chance to prove myself I was accepted in to a recover program where you are put in to regular classes but have a counselor.  In middle school my science and history classes I could sleep in class and if she asked me a question, I would keep my head flat on the desk and answer every question correctly quizzes and tests no problem 100 all day long. Till I got to high school my teacher asked me to write an essay I was terrified so I wrote as little as possible, I was steaming I couldn�t write what I wanted the things floating in my head I couldn�t get them out. Meany years pass I slowly but Shirley made my way to AP classes my writing improved and but compared to my AP classmates I was far from them but I�m getting better every day.  �life is hard it will beat you down if you let it but it�s not about how hard you hit its about how hard you can get hit and keep going � Rock 4 life will never be easy I learned this form a young age but thing that seem hard for some might not be for others. Wrestling was never a hard thing for me ya there where hard practices but its temporary it�s, better to work hard and get your hand razed then to playing around then to be on your back gasping for air. If you�ve wrestled with something, your whole life wrestling for 6 minutes is easy. So many people ask me is it hard is it hard it�s not about weather its hard it about whether it�s worth it, university is no different just another opponent I haft to wrestle agents but before we step in the ring I�m just letting you know university compared to my previous opponents is just a bump in the high way of life.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.  My parents are the ones that have made me who I am. They are the reason to why I am in school. Thanks to them I want to do my best and become someone in life. Each one of them had their own part in order for me and my brother to get here.  My mom, she has worked really hard since the time she got here in order to bring my older brother and me here. She has always given us what we wanted and works hard for it. She has two jobs morning and afternoon. She leaves at 7am and comes home at 11pm from her second job. Sometimes my brothers and I don�t see her the whole day. We would have to say up in order to see her and when she has off.  She tries to hang out with us When she doesn�t work she would take us to the park or anywhere we want. Somehow she always finds a way to spend time with us even though she might be tired. She did her best for me now it�s my turn to do my best for her and give her the life she deserves. Furthermore my father has always been there for us and gives us what we need.  My father on the other hand has only one job. He works in the morning and comes home at 4pm. Somehow he finds a way to pay bills send money to my family In Mexico and have some left to give to us so we can buy what we want. He would give us advice to keep moving forward to not give up and to go for our dreams. All my father wants is for us to be happy and get education. He wasn�t given the opportunity to go to school and be someone in life, but even though he didn�t go to school he is very smart. Now it�s up to me to give them the life they deserve.

Mostly all kids have a good childhood and some not so many that good. People like seeing little kids laugh, smile, giggle, and play. I wished I had a childhood like that it would off change me. I would enjoy my years but I couldn�t because I had responsibilities when I was a little kid. When I was a little kid I had to look out for my little brother. I had to help out my mom around the house and help here clean houses so we can get money and pay the bills and for food. Also on top of anything my dad left us or abandoned us when I was 8 years old. When I was 10 I had to work in a job so I can help out my mom,Prompt: A Personal or national issue that is important to you The distribution of wealth in America is one of the biggest issues to me on a personal level and is a big problem on a national level too. Economic equality doesn�t seem like a priority in this country with the lopsided balance of wealth in this country. Surveys have been done interviewing Americans of all different backgrounds and economic status and most thought that the distribution of wealth in America was a lot closer than in reality what it is. There are a lot of people in America struggling, out of work and not meeting their financial needs and that I see as a big problem because, the situation could be handled better to where everyone can benefit. Now I can�t ever see Americas wealth being distributed equally because, there would be no drive to work and achieve goals and make more money. I do believe that the gap between how much the wealthy, the middle class and poor people make is way too wide. 40 % of this nation�s wealth go to the top 1%. That means those big C.E.O�s guys like bill gates 40% of the whole nations wealth goes to those guys. The average these guys get paid is 380x more than there average employee and in the fast food industries over 1200x more. Now I�m sure that�s these guys work very hard for their money but its very hard to believe that they are working 1200x or even 380x harder than their employees. Also the richest 20% of Americans own 84% of the nation wealth. There are so many people on food stamps and other government assistance programs because, of this problems. You have people with degrees and can�t find jobs that pay well enough to provide for their families and daily lifestyle. There are millions in this country who struggle to make ends meet financially and very few rich people, but yet the ratio of how much they make versus millions of Americans is ridiculous.  There is also a big reason why the rich make so much more money than the poor. Normally poor people are unaware of this situation and just trying to get by in life. The poor and middle class a lot of times do not educate themselves to this situation and it seems as the rich care more because, they want to keep all the money there making. If we want to make money and solve this problem we have to wake up and realize what�s actually going on with our wages and demand a better distribution of the wealth in this country.Prompt: ?  A good lawyer can the be the biggest factor in a case. A great example that many people have heard was is the o.j. Simpson case. Many people thought that he commit the crimes. Most of the proof connected to the crime he was accused did point to him, however Simpson brought the bet lawyers money could buy. With his lawyers he was found not guilty which surprised many people. I personally do not care if Simpson was or was not guilty however his case did teach me the importance of a good lawyer. When I was a boy my brother was arrested for murder, later they found the real killer but he spent two years on the inside. When I found out he was guilty I felt tears falling my face. My family could not afford a very good lawyer and we had to use a family friend, Joe Vincent. My mother said that Vincent was an okay lawyer but the prosecutor was like Peitho, the Greek god of persuasion. My mom would not let me attend the trail (she thought it would be inappropriate for a seven year old.) I had to grind my teeth or I would yell at the top of my lungs. When my brother was convicted many of my own family members believed he was guilty. That reinforced my belief that a lawyer has the power to win any case. That�s why I want to be lawyer to make sure the right people are convicted.  If a lawyer is good enough he can be the main factor in a case. Even with all the evidence stacked, like the Simpson case, a lawyer can still win your case. A convince judge or jury that a man is guilty or innocent, that is why I want to be a lawyer. After the I read about the Simpson case I a light off went in my head, I saw that could help a lot people by just being their lawyer. I know now that there is a lot to being a lawyer but I still want to help people by being their lawyer.  Something else I found out about lawyer is that many people could not afford the good ones. I plan on doing a lot of pro bono work. I want to help everyone I believe to be innocent. Many people who cannot afford a good lawyer and are found guilty and have a harsher punishment, however people of considerable wealth usually get off quite easy because the can afford amazing lawyers. There are many examples of the rich getting off easy besides the Simpson case. Walmart is sued every for some another but they can afford the best lawyers alive. I believe many big companies can sell harmful food or underpay their employees not because they bribe government officials but because they get the best lawyers they can buy to convince the government that everything is fine.  Those reasons I not only want to be a lawyer but I want to start my own firm, because many lawyers abuse their powers of persuasion for money. My firm will be about help people who can�t afford a good lawyer and of course those who can because I need to make a living. I will try to be the best lawyer I can be so no one has to watch their innocent brother go to jail.Prompt: Greatest challenge I have faced  Having to grow up looking different than other can be difficult especially when your overweight .you get looked at differently , judged differently , and treated differently and this has been my greatest challenge faced so far .  What do you think of when you hear of something that weighs 224 pounds? Big and heavy right? Well that was me, a big 14 year old girl with low self-esteem. Everywhere I went I was looked at differently than others. I didn�t even want to leave my room because even my family looked at me differently with eyes looking straight at me up and down with disgust and disappointment knowing that I could do better , but I didn�t care I ate and ate whatever I desired I don�t even know what I ate most of the time because the more they looked at me like that the more I wanted to eat but then I realized I was getting bigger and unhealthy so I ate less and it was a nightmare but then I started noticing results but it still wasn�t enough but I didn�t give up on myself .  As time passed by I was being judged because I was still over weight. People called me fat, ugly and people made fun of me in every possible way they could. I was embarrassed of myself I was even made fun of for trying to lose weight and everything I ate I didn�t know what to do that I would just cry to sleep but I kept telling myself hard work will pay off and people will see that they were wrong to bully some overweight girl because I will shine .  As I got older I started having more friends and they were all thinner than me and every time we went out together all the boy would have their eyes on them but me .I knew is was because of my weight cus no guy likes big girls well at least that�s what thought and all I had on my mind is that why don�t they look at me like that? , why don�t they think im cute ? so I lost more weight .Prompt: Who has influence me the most  I was between the ages of 12-14 when I realized that who has influents me by my parents and my sisters. My parents and sister are my influence because they have been there with me since day one; they also my parents and sisters always told me that what I should do and don�t, Also all of them helps me with everything. My parents and my sisters have been there for me since day one. If I ever need any advice my parents and sisters will always be there for me. Also everyone who influence me they will always have my back and tell will always give me good advice for any problems I have/gotPrompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.  Every time I think of my first day of sophomore year I can picture it in my head like if I am living in the moment. That night I had to go to bed, my eyes were opened as wide as three school buses put together because I could not sleep from how excited I was to go to school. I kept reaching under my pillow for a little white iPhone 4s -that barely functioned just to glance at the time. It was barely twelve or twelve �twenty around that time. I was so anxious to meet new people eat lunch with friends and just the feeling of arriving as a sophomore made it tough for me to fall asleep. I had no Idea I was going to meet someone that will make a difference in me and the way of seeing things in life. You never know who will influence you for good or bad.  It was a brand new year at my high school. Everyone is excited well, almost everyone. As I walked in the building I saw Amanda, one of my classmates from last year. We never really talked it was a Hi and bye kind of thing but this time she was more excited to see me than ever. I could tell by the way she approached me and yelled my name out across the halls. I guess you could say she was lonely and didn�t want to roam the school alone on the first day. I didn�t mind at all because I was alone too. I pulled out a crumpled piece of paper that contained my schedule and I started to scan the routine I had to take. As I placed my schedule back she asked me what I had for first period. �I have French first what about you?� I responded. I recall the smile she carried on her face when she said, �OMG I do too!� We both pulled out our schedules to compare them and it turned out that not only did we have first period together but, we had each other in all classes.  Never did it cross my mind that Amanda and I would have classes together.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.  I Know like every college essay, people talk about their mom being their hero, but in my case I truly believe my mom is my hero. My mom has faced many challenges in her life and she always makes it work out to her benefit. I watched my mother struggle with 3 jobs, she worked in Columbia University in the human resources department, she worked as a mom, and she was my teacher. Even to this day no challenge stops her from reaching her goal, I am glad to say in 2016 like me she will be graduating but she will be getting her bachelors� degree.  When I started the second grade things started to become hectic because I was always getting in trouble at home and my mom being a young mother didn�t know I had a hereditary learning challenge where I have a difficult time hearing and pulling phonetic sounds. She thought I was being lazy and would make me stay up late on school nights to finish my homework. Years later we discovered that my brother came out with the same hereditary reading challenge, we also discovered that the gene was given to me and my brother through my dad who had gotten it from his mother.  My mother wasn�t always the happiest or patience woman, my dad expected a lot from her and so did we. She was our mom, a co-worker, a wife, a teacher, and a chef. A lot of her responsibilities became mine when I entered 6th grade. I was responsible for leaving for school at 8:05, after school going straight to karate class, at 6 o�clock leaving karate to go pick up my brother and sister from afterschool and taking them home so they can start on their homework and I had to help them with their homework too. When I entered the 7th grade I told my mom that it was a lot of pressure to go to school karate and pick up the kids on time to get them home, so she placed me in the same after school program so right after they release me I can get my brother and sister and take them home. Things soon became very complicated when the girls at my school wanted to fight me and would chase me home every day after school. So my mother had to lie and say we lived with my aunt so I can go to the same school as her kids. So my mother would drive me to school every day right before she left for work and I would have to take the bus home to get to my afterschool. When my mother got home at 6:30 she would say hi to us and go straight to the kitchen to cook dinner. MY dad expected dinner to be done when he got home because he worked 2 jobs. My mother did all the parenting because my dad was always tired and sleepy when he got home so she had to do a lot of the disciplining herself. Sometimes her choices weren�t the best but she did the best she could.Prompt: Describe an important transition in your life  Imagine waking up one morning to the bitter sound of nothing. You�re the last to wake up but that could�ve fooled anyone with the amount of silence flowing throughout the entire house. I remember walking downstairs to the kitchen on June 3rd 2015, and seeing my family gathered around the dinner table. Without them even saying a word I already knew what was coming next. I mentally prepared myself for what I was about to hear but there�s not enough ways in the world to prepare yourself to hear that your home isn�t going to be your home anymore.  After 15 years of living in the same house and learning this place like the back of my hand and watching as what was once the little tree outside our house grow every day, or watching the progression of the fresh black concrete fade as the days went by to a dry grey color, after all of that; this house wasn�t going to be ours anymore. This was the same house I learned to ride a bike at, where I met my best friend the first day we moved here from Texas when I was only 3 years old, where I had my birthday parties, where I experienced the most important milestones in my life; letting go seemed more than impossible. Moving day came and I watched as each room in our house became empty; it was almost as if we were never there.  It was an emotional roller coaster. Although a part of me was hurt I had to push my feelings to the side and be a support system for my parents. I did not let them know how I was feeling about the whole situation and just tried my best to uplift their spirits. I didn�t want them to feel in anyway guilty because I knew well that everything was done that could have possibly been done to try to keep our home. I was grateful to them because although we were in a tight situation money wise they pushed every penny they had and still managed to give our family a nice house to live in. it�s a beautiful place really it�s a town house, 2 story, wood floors with white rooms. The first time I walked into this house I felt like crying because I knew there was no going back to my old house. After nights of crying and missing my old home, I realized change should always be good. No matter how difficult the situation might be, or how �impossible� letting go may seem to you at the moment you always have to make sure that you use your time wisely. That�s exactly what I did. This situation might not seem like the most tragic thing in the world, and that�s because it�s not. This transition alone though ,has taught me to enjoy every second of what I have while I have it because you never know if the next day you�ll wake up and it won�t be there for you anymore.  I learned to take advantage of my time because you can never go back. This is a lesson everyone should learn in their lifetime, I know it�s a clich� thing to say but I never really found the true meaning of this until I experienced it firsthand. Time is everything and sometimes you don�t get warnings as to when it will be gone. I�ve lived by this everyday but never really embraced it like I do now. You need to enjoy everything till the last bit of it. Losing my house was an awful point in time for our family, but we learned quickly from this. This happening made us learn to value everything in our lives to a further extent. This was a lesson well learned and well needed.Sixth PeriodPrompt: The greatest challenge that I expect to face  Ok, so since I�m talking about my greatest challenge I thought about it, but I realized I cannot think of one. So I decided to just write about the challenge that I am facing now in my senior year of high school. So really this is the greatest challenge I have ever faced. So come with me in this challenge and image what I�m going through. So one day my consoler had called me in to his office and had showed me what my credits were. So I saw it and I wondered and thought to myself. Am I really going to graduate with my senior class in May 2016? But first for me to do that, I need to go through some steps in order to graduate. And believe me it�s a lot of steps. So the things I need to do are mandatory.  So what I need to do is? 1. Pass all the classes I have this semester and next semester. 2. I have to do credit recovery this semester and next semester. 3. Do 2 classes online or from a different place like faith academy, phoenix, and a different place that which I forgot. 4. Pass all of those in those classes and then I need 1.5 credits of the following: Arts, foreign language, or technology class outside of Berkmar. And this is a lot to do on my part, And not to mention a lot of money for all that. So this year I really got to step up my game a lot on my grades. If I want to pass and graduate next year may. This right here had got put to the top of this list of challenges. But anyway let me continue on this. When I had got home and told my mom and dad what I needed to do. We started looking up what I can do and how much everything is going to be and everything. I can tell u right now it�s not going to be cheap at all. When I was talking to my consoler, and he was telling me a lot of things I need to do. His face didn�t look like a good one. He told me that it would be a lot of work for me and was telling me to just finish it next year in December. And he was saying that it won�t be cheap because of where I had to take it. So I said ok and that I was going to go ahead and try it.  The reason y this is a big challenge for me is because of what my consoler said when I had left his office. He said and I quote that it was going to be hard and he told me that it�s not impossible but he didn�t say it was possible. So when he said that I said to myself this is a big challenge for me do I accept? And in my head I said yes I do challenge accepted. So now this will be the biggest challenge I have ever faced. Now let me see if I can compete this challenge or is it going to be a fail? Never know till I try.Prompt: You have been elected President of the United States; write your inauguration speech for us.  Greetings, my fellow Americans of the United States of America. As your new President, I would like to share my feelings and changes I have in mind to put our country in a positive direction. But, before anything, I would like to thank the citizens of America for making me their new President and giving me a chance to better our country.  First, I have a speech for you America, a speech to demonstrate my options, or plans for this country of ours. Let�s all face it; America is heading upside down, Economy/National issues. Our war on isis has been going on for a bit now, and our previous president has done NOTHING to get us out of the situation, instead he used his 2 cents and made things worse. But , my goal on the other hand , is to bring our troops home and end the conflict with isis , simply by destroying them , talk is cheap , serious action needs to be done, quickly. Now , promises have failed this country so now I will say , America, I will give you my word , isis will no longer be an issue for the United States.  Secondly, I would like to address the welfare problem; it has completely gotten out of hand. Most people on welfare get money every month, without even giving an attempt to get a job or make something of themselves. It�s nice to know where my tax dollars are going, along with many other Americans. But now that I�m in office that will change. The welfare policy will be if you sign up for welfare and you don�t have a job currently, you have 4 months to find a job and be accepted or else if you don�t complete the task, you wouldn�t be qualified for welfare and have to wait 1 year before you can try again. You only get $100 for groceries, every month, which should be great because you will have a job if you�re on welfare.  Lastly, I would like to address the complication of cops, and how some people have their opinion that police officers are to overpowered and they are serving brutality to African Americans. Police officers do their job; they risk their lives to save others. If you�re not in the situation first hand , dealing with the subject , you have no right to share your 2 cents on what you think the cop is doing, because when it all comes down to it , you will need them before they need you. So with that being said I will change the law to where, if you fail to cooperate and listen to the cop by the first instruction, you simply need to be taken in , because you failed to listen and follow direction , and it would be a fine for Failure to follow instructions.  In conclusion, America I�m here to create a brighter future for everything and everyone. But most importantly make a brighter future for our country, The United States of America. With that being said , expect bigger and better things , thank you for electing me as your President.Prompt: ?  Challenges can be helpful or they can be stressful. Either a good stress that motivates you to do your very best or the bad kind that can lead to health problems and bring you down. Either way it goes, challenges help us, regardless if we like what the challenges is. My greatest challenge is happening right now, deciding what college to go to.  There are many different colleges that I can apply to. Most of the schools, I don�t even know the name or where they are located. I want to be a high school art teacher. Meaning I most have 4 years of with a major in education and art as my minor. I originally thought that it that art would be my major and education would be my minor. I was born in Missouri, so it would be good to find colleges there, because I already know the area. Atlanta is my second choose, it is where I am currently living and where I most likely be living for another year.  There are two school that interested me Slayer University and Kaplan U. Slayer has class that I would have to go to, but Kaplan u has online classes which is way more convenient for me saying that I am no actually in Missouri at the moment. Although, I might miss out on the experience of campus life, online classes seem a lot less of a hassle. Now that I have chosen the schools that I am most interested in I have to make a plan of action. I must first look at the requirements and see if I meet them. Then I must make sure I have a place to stay for which ever school I end up going to whether with family, a dorm with a roommate, or even an apartment. Either way it goes I will need to get a job that will allow me to study and attend classes.  Another challenge that would go along with this is that Georgia and Missouri are very different places. In Georgia I feel like a car is a most have thing most of the stores and restaurants are miles away. When I lived in Missouri, I and my friends walked to almost every store and restaurants, the stores were never further then 1-2 miles away from where I lived it was great and we never wasted gas. In Missouri it�s in the north meaning it snows. I used to roll in the snow as a child and December was that happiest month for me because I love when the temperature is below 20 degrees. In Georgia I hate it, here it never snows and the temperature doesn�t even go below 40 degrees. It�s too hot here; if I do end up going to a college in Georgia it will have been my last possible option.  My greatest challenge was deciding what college to go to. Now that I have looked at the pros and the cons, moving to Missouri or staying here in Georgia I decided that Missouri is where I belong. Having already lived there for most of my life and having family close by it would also be the smart choose. Yes Georgia has its pros, but the cons over way them. This challenge has affected my life in a good way. I the way that it made me think about what I want to do with my life after high school it gave me another challenge. That is to get in the college that I want to go to.Prompt: The Person Who Inspired Me The Most  The women who took care of me for 17 years always told me, �Do something that you love and not something for the love of money.� My mom has been and always will be my number one supporter. She was the person who encouraged me to be comfortable in expressing myself. She was the one who wanted me to strive to be someone that I would be happy about 5 years down the road. My mom is the reason I�m going for this. I always knew cosmetology was something I loved and wanted to do for a very long time.  I can remember the first time I started wearing makeup. I woke up one morning feeling bold and snuck in one of my mom�s mascaras out her purse that felt like a never-ending cave. Being only in 5th grade, I had no idea what I was doing. I�ve seen my mom put on her bright lipstick and her neutral eye shadow colors with peachy cheeks before and it just excited me about wanting to be exactly like her. I was terrified that my mom would catch me, but I honestly couldn�t wait to ask her. I only finished putting mascara on one eye and left to school like that.  Throughout the years, I went through some pretty bad embarrassments. My first year of middle school I decided I needed a new me, a new haircut. I chopped off my hair. My nest of hair looked like I closed my eyes and sneezed when I cut it. My seventh year wasn�t any better. I used to watch a lot of videos on the internet. So I decided to experiment on picture day. I see these girls on TV that made any eye color look just absolutely stunning. I wanted to do what they did. I remember wearing this flamingo bright pink on my eyes with some lipstick that looked like a basket of red apples. I don�t know how I survived school. All those years and my mom always told me that practice makes perfect.  As I grew older and my mind-set changed, wanting to be a cosmetologist never did. While everyone wanted to be a doctor, computer expert, or even a zoo keeper, I wanted to dedicate my life on making other people feel good about themselves. I�ve been told that a cosmetologist isn�t a job a hundred times that at some point I started to believe them. My mom is the one who said, �If it makes money, it�s a job.� My passion for hair and beauty is unbelievable. I made sure I got ahead on my high school credits to attend Maxwell and start early. My goal one day after high school and later finishing up cosmetology school is to open up a business over in Texas. I know I�m setting the bar high on this one but I�m going to for it and I�m sticking to this. My mom encouraged me to do this and make it happen at whatever risk. She�s all the support I need to make this happen.  My mom wants me to aim high but walk through stairs. Applying to Paul Mitchell School is the first step on my staircase. Being accepted to this school would be an honor and privilege to attend to. This school is everything I want. Paul Mitchell is every future cosmetologist dream. The challenges I would have to face are going to be worth every sweat and tear being a student here. This is where I set foot outside of my box. Through this school, I will be become the person I�ve long waited to be and I know my mom would be so proud to call me her daughter.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.  Role models, we all them or at least someone we look up too weather that person is real or fictional. Personally speaking I have several role models but the main one that I can say has had the biggest influence on me is batman. �Yes batman� the dark night himself. Going back I remember watching the old series batman and just thinking he was (in simplest terms) awesome! Since then he was already a part of my life but it wasn�t until the beginnings of middle school when he really impacted me. To begin with, I wasn�t a very social person most throughout my life. More or less due to the fact that I had terrible self-esteem because of previous encounters with bulling in elementary school. To worsen things I was already a naturally shy person and my face would always turn tomato red and my palms would start to get moist every time I would get called on to answer a question or even do something simple like walking to talk to the teacher. As years passed by things got worse and they weren�t looking any better as time passed. Thus watching my entire favorite hero�s on TV and such I really got into the character batman. This is because of the entire hero�s that would pass on TV, they all were likable friendly extrovert kinds of people and batman was the complete opposite. He was quite, serious; he wouldn�t play and had no friends, in addition to the fact that even some civilians (the people he protects) fear him. All that though didn�t bother batman. He would still carry his duty and protect the people regardless of anything. So eventually what started to happen was that I found myself relating to batman�s person or character. In doing so, it made things start looking up for me. How? Because I could now be myself and not feel completely down about the way I was. If batman could be serious and scary to people but yet a hero at the same time, why not I.� maybe not a hero� but at least out there handling my business without caring what people think. Anyways as the years started to pass I would just feel better and better about myself. It got to the point that it would show through my character, personality, voice; just everything that I was indeed feeling more comfortable with myself. So By the time of high school I was a different person. I was more out spoken, people would approach me and not say that were scared of me or such. Everything was going great but then things took a slight turn. Those kids that I had problems with bulling in elementary school were going to BHS as well. Everything was still all well until I would see them or they would have the same class as me. I would just feel a huge explosion go off in my chest and my head got really hot and my mood would just change for the worst in a second. The reason for that was that I couldn�t forgive them for what they had done to me previously. This experience or event however let me to be able to relate to batman a little more in the sense of forgiveness. To begin with, watching batman I noticed that no matter what any villain did or how corrupt and psycho that person was, he never once hurt an enemy to the point that they were in the hospital or anything. Instead he would warn them before he did anything and if they didn�t listen then he would take action. From all that though, what I took in was that he forgave the bad for himself to be the better person and not give into a bad path where he would end up being the same or no better than the people he fights against. Thus I admired that and decided to forgive all my enemies and such and just be the bigger person and carry on with my life. In doing so I was able to finish high school and carry on with the world and with ease all thanks to my number one hero/idol batman.Literally I feel like my heart just dropped to the floor and I am terrified to pick it back up. My eyes were locked at the end of the board all I had to do now was to take my steps and do my dive. Every step I took I felt like the board was getting longer and longer and I wouldn�t be able to reach it but at last I was at the end and you better believe I was riding that board like it was my life on the line. Shooting me off like a cannon ball I majestically did my dive and I went into the water like a fish causing no splash at all.  Being in the water felt really peaceful like if it was another world I could hear people clapping and chanting like animals fighting over a piece of meat as I arose to the surface I could hear the scoring from the judges overall they thought it was a good dive. Coming out of the water knowing that I was done competing felt great my heart was no longer on that board it was right back in my rib cage. Considering that it was my first meet I thought I did pretty good looking at my team from a far I could see them jumping up and down and cheering. Getting closer and closer to them made my smile stretch all the way up to the ends of my ears I was extremely happy because knowing that I made them proud gave me great joy in seeing them. Arriving to the bench where my team was stationed at felt like I was arriving to home from a long trip. Minutes after I had taken a seat to rest and to think about overall on how did I began to realize that I had come so far to be at this level. A short woman with big ol� white hair had started to rally up a commotion about me to my coaches. Suddenly I felt a pounding on my shoulder coming from someone wanting my attention I slowly turned around to acknowledge the person and it turned out to be the women with big ol� hair. Looking at me with her big eyes I knew she had some news to tell me and it was good news.Prompt: ?  The past mistakes make you rethink your choices and decisions to better yourself. �Life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change.� My life has been impacted in many ways as I grew up starting when I was 5 years old and barely came to the United States in the year of 2004. I thought my life would be such a hurricane due to what had happened in my family especially with my own mother and led to changing the way of living with my brother. Family is very important in our daily life. Family supports you on anything, loves you regardless how much someone can fail them and family are people that are always there for you helping you with important things such as your education or deciding what type of pathway you will choose when going into college. People in the world do not realize how much impact they can cause into someone�s life either for better or for bad such as falling into depression or finding better ways to make them even better as a person.  Fairy tales don�t exist maybe in movies and shows but not in real life where many broken pieces with unanswered questions will be found, unfortunately some stories don�t end with a �happily ever after�. A couple of months had passed by since I arrived from Mexico to Georgia. A lot of changes were going on in my family, one started with my mother who was being strange all the time, who at times made her own kids feel like the only mother they had was their grandmother and aunts. A few days passed away, my brother and I were playing outside until we saw our mother walking by with a bag that was full of her and my little sister�s clothes. She had told us that she was going to sale those clothes or donate them but who could of thought what she said was all a lie. Days and a couple of months went by no type of communication was involved after my mom left with my little sister, until it was my little cousins birthday party was when I finally got to see my little sister and this time would be for forever. Someone I did not see was my mom.  Years have come by and there was no communication done with her. Almost 15 years have come by with no word being heard from the person that gave me birth, I forgot who my mother is, how she looks like and her way of being. All I remember was that I had a mother who just didn�t care about hurting her own kids or leaving them without thinking about how much they will end up needing her throughout the years. During those 15 years of life for 3 years I fell into depression where all I wanted to do was commit suicide simply because seeing my friends with both their parents made me jealous and feel worthless. I always dreamed of having perfect parents who would last forever and be an example for their own kids. Fairy tales don�t end with happy ending sometimes you have to create your own beginning by having people that will help you and never give up on you and end up with a happy ending. The years continued to go on until I was 10 years old. My brother was going into his last year of high school unfortunately my family was breaking apart economically. My father had it very tough with my siblings, grandma and I. He had two jobs in which he got paid well but that money wasn�t enough for the bills that needed to be paid.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.  Did you ever had that feeling when you�re hopeless? Or that moment when you just want to give up? Or that feeling when you�re stuck and don�t know how to get out of the situation? I had, a ton and I feel like I�m the only one with problems. That�s when I need help but like friends aren�t always there. My sister Elsy has helped me time to time and gave me advice even though I don�t do what she tells me what I should do in my own problems.  My sister Elsy, loves to create pictures on paper. She also influence me on �Not giving up� and �There�s more than one way.� Whenever I need advice, she�s the one that can give a hand. She even has her bad situations of her own, when she draws. Elsy makes an image on a paper, yet it doesn�t seem right to her, so she keeps on trying till she gets it right. Then there�s me, I doutle something and it comes out awful, so I do what Elsy did. I keep on tryin� till I get it right.  Elsy also helps me when there�s a boy problem, in relationship, sometimes I need help on what to do. The feeling when I was being a toy and my feelings didn�t have meaning. There�s problems everyday and it never quits. Elsy tells me to drop it and go to the next one or better to stay single. She was right and I realized I needed to think of myself first and for what is best for me. I give people advice, yet I don�t know why I don�t take my own advice.  Elsy also influence me on planning for my future after graduation. My sister has a big future ahead of her and she knows where her place is at. It made me think,What am i going to do after graduation? Which college am i going to go? Where am I going to be in the future? Of course Elsy lend a helping hand and step by step my plans grew. I would go to college and learn fashion arts or music. After college I head off to country to country and with my career, I express it. Soon I would settle in a very wealthy house with new members.  Even though Elsy is younger than me she is a big influence for me. Her life was like a shadow being behind me between middle school and high school, that is how she understands what I�m going through. She knows what is best for me �I�m telling you this Sandy because I don�t want you to end up in the garbage out in the world.� We act like cats and dogs time to time and I hate it when Elsy acts like a parent. But Elsy had helped me through rocky times. I love the fact that she�s my sister and I can always count on her when I need a hand.Prompt: ?  Donald Trump wants to beat everyone in poles but where does he really stand in the economy? Lately all he has been arguing about is immigration insisting that Mexican immigrants were �When Mexico sends its people, they�re not sending their best. They�re not sending you. They�re not sending you. They�re sending people that have lots of problems and they�re bringing those problems with us.

It would be best if you started thinking about your future nobody knows where you are going to be in the future so it is the great thing to start thinking. It would be great if I achieve my achievement that I always have been achieving for. And it is to start a business of my own to have a better career in the future but in order for that I need to have education also a lot of money to build the business that I am trying to build because it will need a lot of equipment that is necessary for the business. So I going to try to build up as fast I could to make some money for me and to have my own house also I would like to graduate from high school because I�m trying to be the first member of my entire family to graduate from high school. It has so much meaning to me because ever since I saw my brother dropout I was thought that I going to the first to get a high school diploma to have a better job than my brothers, I would like to buy a new house for my family. In order for me to get there I need to get the all education I need in school but is going to worthy it because it will help me in the future with other jobs or working company of hand works so it won�t be difficult for me in the future when I need to do those types of things with self in company or jobs. One day I was doing hands work in the job to clean up the mess that they have made there but it was so messily that I will need some people to help me in the back.Prompt: Discussing the greatest challenge I have faced and expected to face.  I read a quote before; the quote said �It might take a year, it might take a day, but what�s meant to be will always find its way.� It had an unknown writer, but that don�t mean the worlds where not powerful. What do this quote means to me is that life is a challenge. In which it is, but that don�t mean you can�t get passed that challenge. My biggest challenge is my IEP. What does IEP means to me; well I should say what it did mean to me. IEP means to me is a small problem in life that I have struggled with for a long time. The real meaning is �(IEP) � to help kids succeed in school�. I have an IEP in reading, math and writing.  I would say reading is my biggest one, it not that I can read it just means I struggle with that the most. I have the biggest fear that one day I would just get called out in front a whole bunch of people and be told to read something. People are my biggest fear when you say something or something they would laugh. When I am by myself when I read for miles, it seems I forget all the worlds when I�m around people. I have been getting better though, I read more and also out loud.  Math is the easy for me; I can do it with flying colors if I know what I�m doing. For math all I have to do is listen to the teacher and ask questions. Really math isIndicate a person who has had a significant influence on you can describe that influence.  Role models are people you look up to and admire. They can be celebrities, family members, or a friend. They can also influence you through many ways like maybe through a song or a picture .Their influence can either be positive or negative. My mother has influenced me to be hardworking, supportive, and positive. My mother has influenced me to be hardworking, because she started working at a young age, she has her own business, and she started from the bottom. My mother started working at the age of 13 in Mexico, and she was taken out of school. She practically was the only person bringing home the money, because her parents didn�t work enough to support the family. This made me realize that working hard in school pays off, because not everyone has the same opportunities in other countries. My mother owning her own business influences me to strive to own my own business someday and be the best I can be. She is her own boss and doesn�t have to worry about someone else constantly being over her. Also she started from the lowest point to building her way to the top. This shows me that it doesn�t matter where you come from or who you are you have the potential to be a somebody and not be nobody.  My mother has influenced me to be positive, because you are able to see a different outlook on life and many doors open for you. My mom has gotten to where she is today by staying positive, no matter how bad a certain situation got or if she was going through a tough time; She always looked on the bright side. She would always overcome that certain obstacle. This taught me that no matter what obstacle I face, I will overcome it. Also staying positive can lead to opening new doors for me, because mom has had many doors open for her. She started working for the first time when I was 8, and she would get mean comments from her coworkers .She didn�t allow that to affect her instead she stayed positive, and she soon started to get more and more opportunities. She was able to buy the store she was once an employee at, all because she was positive and kept her cool throughout the time she was working there. This has made have a different point of view on things and not to hold grudges towards other people.  My mother has influenced me to be very supportive of myself and others, because being supportive towards other people can really show others what�s important to you, and what you care about. My mom has been very supportive about my plans and goals for the future. She has sat down with me and asked me about my future plans, and she listens to what I have to say. She also gives me advice on how I shouldn�t be to insecure on what other people say about me and always do my best at whatever it is. This has really taught me that I am really fortunate to have a mom who supports me, because not everyone is fortunate to have parents who support you on your plans after high school.  In all, my mom has been the person I admire the most; she has influenced me in many ways the words can�t explain. She has taught me that it is important to be hardworking, because hard work pays off. Also that having a positive mind set can lead to new opportunities. Also that having support in your life can help you .Prompt: Discuss what makes you uniquely qualified for this position.  The reason why I should work at Footlocker or any other shoe company, because I have the potential for working with shoes, and Im also an excellent shoes salesman. I really want this job, because I can finally help support my mom pay some bills and help my family with the rent, and also make her proud. To be honest I really think that working at footlocker is going to be an easy task to do because once a customer walks in the store imam greet them with respect and let them find some shoes that they are looking for, and if I see them struggle then imam walk up to them and ask them if they need any help or any shoes that they are looking at in particular. There are going to be some strengths and weakness that I�m going to have when I work there, and my strengths are greeting the customers with a smile, asking them if they need any help, going to the back room and going to get their shoe size and then going to the register and ringing them up correctly. My weakness are knowing the type of shoes that they want that will be comfortable for them and also seeing which shoe will be in style for kids and adults, but I can manage to get to that by researching online and looking them up to get real comfortable with hooking them up with shoes. I feel like that I can be way better than the other workers that I�m going to be working with because once a customer comes in and ask one of my co-worker that they are looking for some shoes that they can play basketball in and then they�re going to be like I don�t know what you�re talking about, then that is when I come in and be like I know the perfect shoes that can be fit for you when you play basketball, then I walk over to that section and show them and then they are going to say hey I like these, then I ring them up and tell them to have a nice day and come back and see us again. Another reason is that I�m very organized and very nice when it comes to talking to people and I�m also very friendly, for example if you come up to me and ask me a question I am going to say sure I can help you with something and then walk over there and see what the customer needs help with and then once they ask me that they need a shoe measure, I�m going to go and get the thing to measure their foot to see what size I need to get.Prompt: Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence. Is there a person who significant influence on you. Like your parent, your friend, and your cousin. What makes you unique person you are today. The person takes you places you like to go. Who makes you happy when you are in a bad day? There is a person I significant influence. That is my dad. He do is best for us, have insurance, makes go to school and buy us food. My dad tells me what is right and wrong. Each day if we do something wrong he would repeat the things over and over again in a good way.  We love him anyway he does. He takes the places you like to go. I wanted to go to the mall or the book store. My dad was doing something he was watching a soccer games, he said to wait for the break time. He will drive you there. I have a sister we always fright, so my dad would say when you get order you won�t have each other backs and regret what you have back then.  My dad would always tell us a story when he was small. Each time we talk during dinner time he would about his stories. He would say your parent can�t stay with you; you have to do it on your own. When we have some kind of party, he doesn�t like other people talk about his family like that. There are some people doesn�t like us. Most of the party we go there are my mom she has a lot of friends. He always asks us about our day. He always asks us about our day. When we get home from school he would say that to us. My dad wants me a good life, not like my parent right now. My dad work at a Mayer Electric Suppler, my mom work at a nail place each day is like that. My dad doesn�t want us like them. He would want us always to go to school.Seventh PeriodPrompt: Think of a place you know well. Describe the place, and include your feelings about it.  Home; there�s no place like it. It�s my favorite place to be but also the place I loathe the most. The 13 years that I have lived in my house there have been so many memories made with my family and friends. Memories full of nonsense and memories full of love and fun. All the foolishness and nonsense began when I moved from an apartment, into the house I live in now. I was only 4 when Daniel moved in the big blue house next to mine. Daniel is significant due to all the memories we made together and because he�s my best friend. Daniel was the more creative, fun, and mischievous one between us. For example, one day when he and I were together and we were bored he thought of this game called �adventures� and I would always look forward to playing with him. Daniel to me was like a role model and if it weren�t for him I wouldn�t be me today. Although Daniel moved away not too long ago he and I are still best friends and if it weren�t for him I wouldn�t be the person I am today.  Growing up as a kid I would say I was different from the average American kid. And not only was I different so was my home/ lifestyle. I found out from experience that there�s no place like my home. My family is from Bosnia and in Bosnia we do things different than here. Even though I was born here in Georgia, I�m still very Bosnian due to my family. For example, in our culture we don�t wear shoes in the house; I learned to take off my shoes whenever I enter a house. I was different and unique because my parents weren�t really accustomed to the American life and they wanted me to retain all of our Bosnian culture but America changes you. America changes you because surviving in America is different than Bosnia. In Bosnia it would be easier to find a job, make money, and live a regular life but I had to forget about simplicity and an easy life and get accustomed to our economy. Although life may be harder here in America when I�m home everything is easy that�s why I love being home. Now that I�m all grown and finishing high school soon I see my home and family in a different way. I understand everything my parents were trying to retain and teach me but still accept that I had to change to survive in America. Just like my mom had to learn English so she could get a job and provide for me and my family I had to do the same to provide for me and now also for my mom and dad. I also realized home isn�t home without your family and your family doesn�t only consist of blood relatives. An actual family for me consists of my blood relatives and my friends Daniel, Elvis, and Donny. If it weren�t for every one of them home would never be the same. They all created me and created my home to be the way it is today.  So when you think about it there�s really no place like home, and that doesn�t just include me it includes the whole world. I�m, sure everyone feels the same. If it weren�t for me moving into this house, for me meeting Daniel, for me changing to get accustomed to the American way of life I wouldn�t be here today and I wouldn�t be the [...] I am today.Prompt: ? Many states are known by their stereotypes and other people around the world actually believe those stereotypes. New Jersey is one of those places that people believe only loud mouth and reckless citizens reside there. However, that is only what is shown on television just for the amusement of society. This voluptuous state is full of way more than just their stereotypes, we represent equality and togetherness. Being born and raised there, has taught me how to be a mature young lady. It has also taught me that your family can be spanned out across an entire state, and they will always be there for you. New Jersey is a place that I know well and that will stay in my heart no matter where I travel to. I lived in a small town that resided in Bergen County called Hackensack. It shared a small area with two other towns; Englewood and Teaneck. These towns were so small that you could walk over the bridge and you would be in Teaneck. Everything was so close to each other and it was very convenient in any type of emergency situations. Walking down the streets of Hackensack, you could just smell the aroma of flowers sprouting from the ground and smoke from the buses. You could hear people greeting you every five seconds that you walked down the street with a warm �Hello�. People always had bright smiles on their faces like they had all won the lottery, even when it was like a blizzard during December. I lived near a diner called Fairmount Diner, Target and B&W Bakery, which were right across from the train tracks. You could smell pancakes dripping in syrup from the diner and freshly baked pastries containing sugar and flour from a mile away.  Hackensack became a gigantic influence on the way that I live my life. It has molded me into the model young woman that I have grown to be. Even after moving to Georgia, Hackensack is still in my heart no matter what and always will be. It was just one of those places that allowed me to be as creative as Leonardo da Vinci and I have learned to express that in my current location too. Whether it be through writing or drawing, I am a creative person. New Jersey taught me about family, equality and individualism in many ways that I could never possibly forget. That is the one place that means a lot to me and I am planning on going back really soon. I will be going back to see old friends and reconnect with all my family. Hackensack, New Jersey is a place that I know well and is also a place that will stay in my heart forever.Prompt: ?  Many things in life help you become a better person and make you see how you should be. In my life there was one thing that really made be treat people differently and really began to love life. This was something that hit me like a fast ball and it was something that changed me forever. Heart beating fast, eyes bulged, Nothing was more important than this moment. I gave all my focus in to my cousin as she picked which hand the freshly covered in copper penny was in. My expressions and body turned firey inside and out as she somehow managed to pick the right hand again. Me becoming envious decided to change it up and do anything so that my cousin wouldn�t win. The first thing that came to my head was that I should hide the penny in my cloths but I only had on my non pocketed jean dress and I had no pockets to hide them there so that was out of the question. The last and most secure place to me to hide the penny was in my warm moist mouth. At the time this seemed like a very intelligent Idea. Until my cousin chose a empty hand and I opened up my mouth and me still being the jealous person that I am decided I never wanted her to even see the penny again so I had made a decision that wasn�t well thought out.  I swallowed it! When it happened I could taste the copper slowly go half way down my throat. It happened so fast that I didn�t realize that I had done something complet  ley wrongPrompt: ?  Chorus Room  Who am I? I always repeat that question to myself. I realize that I�m a different person then I was three years ago. When I view myself in the mirror I don�t see all the agonizing misery that once took a place in me. I recognize a different person, someone who is overjoyed and at peace within their self. I only found this new conception because of a chorus room.  High School pointed out all my flaws the moment I walked down the street at 6:25 a.m. to get to the bus stop on time. I arrived at this huge contraption at 6:45 a.m. As I walked in feeling apprehensive and insecure seeing all the different types of people. I found myself trying to find a familiar face to socialize with, but instead I ended going to my first class of a new environment. In first period looking at 4 white walls and too timid to try and make conversation to new people� in comes some old friends and I was so excited to see them and start to make conversation. And soon it was time for Chorus. Chorus ended up being my safe place. A place where I could be myself and no one could judge me. I met all kind of different people in, and two of them became my best friends. They brought me out my shell and opened this new person that is present here today.  The Berkmar High School Chorus Room changed my life completely. I never was in a place where I felt so welcomed and felt like I belong. I always had to hide who I was because the fear of being rejected by society. But I wasn�t rejected, I was accepted for all my flaws something that High School didn�t do. High School pointed out all flaws but The Chorus Room made me embrace my flaws. It was the best thing that could ever happen to me. I grew and grew into a person you wouldn�t even recognize three years ago, by my looks, maybe a little. Yes, not by the way I walked or talked or even the way I ate. But by how jubilant I was how nothing bothered me even loosing friends.Prompt: Discuss the greatest challenge you have faced or expect to face.  People face a lot of different challenges throughout their lives. Some are able it to make it through and others just quit and fall off. Well I am not a quitter. I have faced challenges before and if I have to go through that situation again; I am sure that I will succeed.Prompt: ?  The person that has the most influence on me in life is superman, or you can say one of the strongest people I know��my dad. He�s like my backbone that keeps me straight. There�s so many different thing I have learned from him and YouTube. I look up to my dad, because he goes out to work every day to provide and help my mom, sister, and me. I can tell working year round is not easy, but you got to do what you got to do. He�s taught me how to not waist money depending on other people to do the same thing I can do. There�s no telling where I�d be without him.  He raised me to not be dependent on others, and different ways to make money the clean way. He introduced me to many different things that I know for a fact I wouldn�t be doing without him today. We hang out more as best friends more than farther than son. Year round we are working and riding our horse. During fall and winter we hunt, and in the summer time only I fish. Mainly because he�s not too good at it like I am. He�s the one that taught me most of the laws of life that I know. The top two of them is �Every day is a new day�, and �Learn from yesterday, live for today, and hope for tomorrow�. Sometimes I think about what if I wake up one morning and he�s not there anymore.Prompt: ? Its 12:34 a.m. and I wake up frightened that I hear the phones from my job ringing. Ever since that moment forward I realized that needed to go to college that I wouldn�t be able to work at a fast food like Pizza Hut. In life, there are challenges you have to change to be a better person in your future. In this moment, I realized didn�t want to work at a place where I would be bossed around in a way that I felt uncomfortable. I have faced many different situations to the point where I feel that I can�t be having someone treat me this way. Thanks to this job I�ve realized that I need to work hard to get easy money. In other words, I need to go to college and face another hard challenge to get to where I can make easy money and not have to deal with people treating me however they want.  As a young teenager you want to make your own money to get your own things. In high school you face many situations and challenges in which you realize you need to be more dependent on yourself then your parents. Now as a senior I have realized its worth coming this long way and doing all I had to do to get where I am today. I am thankful for everyone that has helped me along the way and has pushed me to keep going. When I first started working my family supported me telling me if I didn�t like the job because if I did it would mean I liked easy money in a way that isn�t fair. In other words, it would not be right that I would work so hard to get so little money.There are many places in the world that can change a person. It could be a church or a certain place that you visited. It all can affect you from the way that they act, to the Future decisions you make. One place in significance many can relate to is prison. One place that I may Say has changed me is the football field. This place in many ways has changed me to become a better Individual. To begin with, being on the football field alone conjures up memories good and bad. One way that it has changed me to be a better individual, is to always work hard. A moto that has always been self-evident every time I suit up, and walk on to the football field. For instance, one memory that comes to mind is the very first time I step foot on the field. I could remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Tuesday evening and hot as devils toes. The sweat trickled down into my eyes where it began to burn with no chance of it stopping at all. Then the coach called for individuals. I could not have taken another second of this. My knees began to tremble under the weight of my fatigue, but then one of the head coaches pulled me aside and told me calmly, � you got this son, just keep going and never, the pain of today will be your gain tomorrow, I believe that you will go far.� Ever since then have always worked hard. In additionPrompt: ? It was a warm sunny fall Sunday afternoon. It was a tough very stressful decision to make. Choosing a University to attend next fall. This experience has shown me that it�s tough to make a decision without your parent�s having a say. In what could affect you as you transition into your next phase in life. Receiving letters from different colleges is very exciting. Just to know that they are mailing and calling you just so you can come to their college is very fun. Seeing your mom�s face turn bloodshot red, because she is tiered of all the college drama. Colleges will go to war with each other so they can lure you in to come on their campus.Prompt: Discuss what make you uniquely qualified for this position.  Continuing my boxing career is one of the best decisions I have ever made. Because as a kid I loved things that were physically involved .However it may seems very easy sport. But it�s really not. Meanwhile looking at the TV while two fighters are taking the hits may seem a little cool. But the fact that it can damage their brain in a long term. However it�s hard to believe .Let us not forget that boxing is still one of the best sports that was invented during ancient Greece and Rome.  Since I was 8 year old I loved boxing. I use to watch it a lot. I basically like sports that physically involve punching. Meanwhile I am new to United States of America .on the other hand, there was an Afghani family that that just moved to USA. My family knew them well. However one day I was watching a boxing match and he saw me .He asked me if I want to join a boxing club? Well he was a great boxer in Colombia .he had won a lot of trophy and medals and etc.Bascially the next day he takes me to the gym and my training begins. However know that he knew I loved boxing and how I take it serious. He decided that he will train me very seriously and he won�t take it easy on me. However, for some reason I love his idea about training me very seriously .Because there are two different types of athletics in this world. One that takes it serious just like it�s his or her passion. On the second hand there people who does for the time killer or the money. Well to me doing a sport for money is stupid idea. However there�s people in world that does it for the money or to kill time. But however to me boxing as always been my sport, and my passion.  It was early in morning. The sky was still dark. While we were in car, going to Gym.my coach said today is a big day for you.when we arrive in the gym .I Saw couple of parents there and couple of students. It was a big day for me.It was my first boxing match. The first round went very well .But however during round nine, my hands were giving up.it was hard for me to see.Becuase I was stuck in a corner. However every time I would try to clinch on him. He would throw a jab and hook. Which was hard for me stay on balance. He would try to unbalance me but it wouldn�t work. Now that round nine was over my coach told me this is the round that I have to go full power. Because we can�t take the risk of going all twelve rounds. So the round started and I was dizzy I was acting like I was okay. But I got caught with a hook and he put into his corner. And he landed a lot of punches .But meanwhile I was waiting for him to do a single mistake and KO him. He seemed very tired. We still had a minute left on the clock. Well he drop his hands and my reaction was fast I duck down and jabbed him twice and I throw a right hook which made him off balance .From that point it was my turn so I throw many punches and my last punch KO him. And I won the match. Everybody thinks that boxing is an easy sport. It�s not it take time to build speed and power punches. From that point on I learn my lesson no to wait for opponent to attack first. I should always start off.  To conclude, boxing has always been part of my life. To me boxing is like having a best friend beside you. �According to some, boxing is just a sport, but according to me is not just sport, it�s my passion, my life.�  I have faced plenty of challenges but the most important one that I expect to face is going to college. However, I just think of myself everyday of where I will be in the future. College is one of the most important things in someone�s life because without college you�re going to stay getting paid $7.25 an hour. College is a must have I see people every day struggling because they didn�t went to college. I think that everyone should go to college if they want to be successful.  People that go to college great treated different then everyone else because people know that they are going to be successful people in life. The other people that don�t go to college get treated like crap. For example, I know my cousin that work at a mall and they were clowning him because he didn�t have a high school diploma. You don�t want to be like my cousin because even if someone asks you if you graduated you will feel embarrassed to say no. That�s why it�s important to go to school and do what you have to do to get that education.Prompt: ?  About 300,000 kids in America that plays high school football .Only 2,000 of those kids receive division 1 scholarship to college.100 of those 2,000 kids that make it to college go to the next level and that�s the NFL and most of them won�t make the team. Well I�m one of those 300,000 kids that is fighting against the odds to be able to earn a college scholarship. It�s a tough challenge that I have to face it�s my senior year, and I have no, stars, no ranks, and only one way out.  Year after year hearing the sound of a buzzer going off and hearing cheering and joy, but not from the people beside you nor behind you, but across the field of grass another team has defeated you again. The years of having losing seasons. This is the year that it�s not going to happen again and I can�t let that happen either. Definitely to the underclassmen who are the future of our program.Prompt: ?  The definition of challenges is to arouse of one�s action or effort to stimulate the quality or requiring full use of one�s ability, and energy. One of the greatest challenges that I am facing right now is high school. Why is high school my biggest challenge you might ask. Well it�s simple deciding what to do with your life after high school, what career, and what field. All can take a lot and put stress on you.  My challenge is to finish high school and decide what to do with my life. For some of you who do not know. High school is not what you expect it to be like. Walking the hallways felt like an evening commute home on the I-85. The school lunch can only be described as a weeks ago bread. Every day you walk/drive home exhausted. Some days I would come home not remembering anything at school. I would always question myself.  The hardest part about a high school life is to get past the distraction you face every-day. Walking to class in the traffic filled hallway, my lungs rapidly pace itself, my muscle straining itself, and all to do what. Walk through the hall. So much work just to walk in the hallway. Why it is that people like to hang out at the doorway. No common sense. Doors are meant for walking through, not standing and blocking it while people try to push their ways across.  Out of all the little distraction I face every-day, one challenge still remain. What would I do after high school? After 4 years of high school I can still not make up my mind. There are many options but I cannot pick which is the best for me. What college should I go to, what field should I do what about the military? All the questions I want to answer but simply cannot.  In conclusion, I am currently trying my best to figure out what to do with my life after high school. I do not know whether I am going to which college or if I am to attend the military. Whatever happens in the future will happen depending on my actions this year. After all what is the point of a challenge if it doesn�t make you try your best.Prompt: Discuss a place that has changed you  Have you ever been told that the whole point of life is learning to live with the consequences of the bad decisions we�ve made. It only takes a place and a wrong decision to change your life around and sometimes your future plans. To me it all happened around the end of the school year of senior year. I was a 16 year old girl attending Berkmar High School. I decided to drop out of high school to have a job and depend on myself because of family problems I had a sick dad who got fire and a stepmom who only work part time. My only choice was to help and hold down my family. Dropping out of high school is an issue face by many teens today including me unfortunately. There are many causes to drop out of school but with those causes come many negative effects. Out of those effects I learn that school is really important and brightens anyone�s future as so makes our career easy.  School was really a waste of time for me. I had zero interest. I�m sure school is a huge benefit if you are actually interested. But it only was making me angry and depressed. I honestly never thought I would drop out of high school. I loved school; I love learning, being organized and the socializing when I was in elementary school to middle school. Things change; sometimes they changed in bad ways. I was very hurt and felt like I was worthless for not being able to continue my education I was basically committed to demonstrate to my family and friends that I was that one person with honors cords and the crowd cheering me while I walk to receive my diploma. A lot of those people were disappointed at me. I felt like I was the definition of a high school dropout. At that point I decided to help my family out since money was needed around that year. I told my dad my decision and he agree he said he understands I want to help them out but he told me I had to promise I will come back to school and graduate. As a teen I just want the best for me and my future family so of course I will be a high school graduate and a collage graduate as well.  There are many reasons why any dropout decides school is not for them as many people say now days. I was once one of them. I kept telling myself that I wouldn�t graduate on time I was already behind. All those negative thoughts made me not believe in me anymore. I started skipping classes. I didn�t care about school anymore, I didn�t care about my grades anymore not even the classes I was doing good at. At the end of the year I decided to drop out what the point of going to classes is when I was already failing them I kept asking myself. Until the day came when I decided to not go to school anymore and be welcome to the real life �having a job and depending on you.�  During that time I was struggling to find a job. I felt like nobody was there for me. Everybody was still going to school to finish what I couldn�t finish my junior year. I felt left behind alone and helpless until I met a friend who works as a waitress. I told her what was going on and if she could help me find a place to work at her job. Finally they hire me at her job at that point I was really happy and felt like everything was getting better. I hated working every day from 2pm-2am I got home really tired I wanted to give up but I would have felt like a loser until I realize how hard and stressful is to work. To remind you it was my first job at age 16. I hated the job I knew this wasn�t for me that�s when I realize and open my eyes and told myself what was I doing here. I rather wanted to be at school then working somewhere I hated it.  Finally summer came I decided to go to summer school and finish some classes. I was doing goo still manage to go to work. Then finalyPrompt: ?  The smell of salt in the air and women in bikinis all around us. What would you think your at? The beach of course a place where most would spend spring break at or for just relaxation. This place I know well is Myrtle Beach, SC just place I can�t forget. I do have feelings for this place I didn�t spend much time their but I really have somewhere in my heart I could not forget.  To start off why this place means something to me is because my dad choose this play to spend time there as a family, well now since he is not with us anymore that place is just a reminder of my pops. Not just of the memories I have of it is special it is also a beautiful resort I would recommend to others to enjoy. With its crystal blue waters and a great view of the atlantic ocean something you can�t see everyday.�Dad, where�s mom� I asked. My dad looks over, sighs, and says to me �She�s Working son. She�ll be home later�. I�d look up at him, and see my dad smile at me like there�s nothing wrong, and hug me. My dad knows that I and my sister know that she�s been leaving. He didn�t want us to worry because we were just kids. So he�d make up things like �She�s working� or �She�s at the store�. My dad was having a hard accepting the she was leaving, and so were we. Abandonment doesn�t just affect the other parent but the kids as well.  As a kid I knew something was wrong but I didn�t know what. I could hear yelling from my parents especially from my dad. I�d hear bits of what they were saying. My dad �You need to stop�.� My mom �I�m going�.� I hear a door slam and just curl up in my bed, blanket covering me, hiding. My mother was like any other mom working, cooking, cleaning, etc. then she got into gambling. At my age I didn�t know what that was. A little after that she would go missing. It started with a couple of days to weeks. I don�t know what my mom was thinking. She had five kids my older sister, me, my little sister, and twin boys. My mother had taken up a gambling problem. My mother would take my dad�s money and go to a casino. Win or lose she�d go. She lost so much at one point that we lost our house. Not just that house but two more after that. She�d come back to my dad all broke, but he wouldn�t care because he loved her. Once she was back the cycle would happen again. This happened until we were going to another house and she brought along her �friend�. I say �friend� because she told my dad he was just a friend but in reality she played him. That �friend� turned out to be the guy she ran off with. Him over my dad. It left my dad devastated.  My dad had a hard time accepting that she had left him for another man. That she had gave up on her husband and kids. He couldn�t handle the fact she had did not want him. My father wasn�t the same after that. He�d throw himself into work. If he was home he�d be working on something. He became silent not talking. My dad has never been through this. So he didn�t know how to deal with something like this. How can you. The night that he found out that she was leaving I found my dad in his room crying. My father is crying. I couldn�t help but just hug him. It was my dad. A man I never thought can cry. I found him at the edge of his bed shaking his head while slow tears just falling from his cheeks. He hears me come in with my older sister, and tries to wipe up his tears. Saying he�s fine don�t worry. My dad is a very prideful person. He never wanted us to see him weak or down so he would always be happy no matter what. It was just sad because he wasn�t the only person who was struggling. My sister and I were too  Like my dad I was having a hard time dealing with this issue. I felt it was my fault. Like I could�ve done something to change what happened. Like what can I do to bring her back. What can I do. I had many trust issues built on this. I didn�t trust anyone because I felt as if they weren�t telling the truth. I didn�t trust that people would stay in my life. I felt like what�s next to go, my dad. I felt like I could never believe in happily ever after. I thought I will be alone all my life. I became emotionally depressed. Because my mother had left with no emotion at all. Just packed up and left. This was the moment I felt abandoned. From there I isolated myself from everyone and everything. I didn�t want to let people come into my life and just leave like she did. I built my wall to keep anyone from getting in friends, family anyone. I�ve been like this for years but keep it to myself. I didn�t feel the need to open up to anyone. Years passed by now and I�m eighteen now. I still have issues but I�m trying to get passed it. I�ve accepted she has left. I�ve been trying to get back in life and experience it. I have a better perspective on thing and how they work. It hard but I found what I want to do and be in life. I want to be a psychologist. I want to be a psychologist because I want to help treat the minds of other so they don�t have to feel like I have or bad in anyway. I made my goal out of this situation. My goal in life is to help anyone and everyone so they can be happy in life. It doesn�t matter friends, family, strangers anyone that feels sad or mad or even alone. I want to help them.Prompt: ?  One of the places� I know best is where my parents were born and raised. This place is where I can find freedom. Every year I go visit I feel like an eagle soring throw the blue sky. My heart starts to race every time my family and I go visit. Every year we go visit my parents family, it shows me that family is what really matters in life. The first year I visited my parents� home town was when I was ten years old. We had left the house around two in the morning on a Saturday night. That night my mom and dad where ready with the luggage and everything in my dad�s ford f-350 (king ranch). My brother and sister had woken up when I walked in there room and told them to get ready so we could leave. While my brother and sister started to get read, my mom started to look for our passports, while my dad checked the truck for anything that might cause a problem with it.  After my mom and dad had done everything they needed to do we headed off on the freeway. My brother and sister half asleep in the truck and, my mom and dad as well. Me on the other hand, my heart was still racing and just jumping with joy inside. My dad started driving and it would take us one full day and three more hours just to get to the border. My mom and dad toke turns drive and I also helped them out a little as well. After the long drive we finally reached the border and there were a lot of people there. The line to cross the border was very long, more than the down town Atlanta traffic is on a game day. After the 3 hours we spent at the border we were ready to hit the road again. It was my dad�s turn to drive again, pulse he was the only one that know the shortest way to get there without taking the long way like last time.Prompt: ?  Three specific things about me is I like American History, because you can learn so much about American in some many classes. So I want to go to college get my major in history and might become a teacher on day. Another specific thing about me is that I�m a hard working person, I ask questions we need, and always caring about each other. So I hope to keep that positive feeling with me till I die.  The Final specific thing about me is my family is Athletic, because my parents played sports while there were young and in high school. My sister is playing two sports right now Softball and Basketball, but I�m the only person that doesn�t play high school sports. But I still play sports after school. So I hope that you let me in your University to played sport and be a positive student in life. Also to accomplish my goals I set while I�m there.Prompt: ?  Donald Trump wants to beat everyone in poles but where does he really stand in the economy? Lately all he has been arguing about is immigration insisting that Mexican immigrants were �When Mexico sends its people, they�re not sending their best. They�re not sending you. They�re not sending you. They�re sending people that have lots of problems and they�re bringing those problems with us. They�re bringing drugs, they�re bringing crime, they�re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.� and arguing Mexican immigrants bring �tremendous infectious disease� to the country, which is not true, not just that but threating tariffs because he is �rich� as he claims in CNN news. �I�m rich and not using lobbyists. I�m not using donors. I don�t care I�m rich� and expects us to believe that he�s really going to makes U.S.A a better place when he plans to hurt people and family�s and doesn�t care about other races other than the legal people whom according to him do not make crimes or are not spreading diseases  As many people have heard Donald Trump is working with Univision as head management in miss U.S.A pageant. as soon as this 20015 pageant ends he claims that he is not satisfied because of a �non-completed agreement in his contract.� When in reality he is just trying to make an honest buck out of Univision that happened to be the biggest Hispanic news industry and the TNT network news interview him and ask him �do you regret the comments?� Donald Trump: �Not at all had I said people from all over the country� TNT network: �how much are you sewing them for?� Donald Trump: �I�m sewing them for a tremendous amount of money for defamation� when really the person who should be sewed for defamation is him for saying people from the middle east and Islamic people are destroying our country  The real question is do we really want a guy to run for America? He can barely hold his tongue when it�s his turn to speak, just common sense as a child, even a child knows better. they know when they are permitted to speak and when they should start speaking and how without being rude if you ask me I believe Donald trump was a troubled child and still is today don�t get it wrong he has good qualities but I still feel he shouldn�t be given such a higher power when his idea of respect is as ideal as a three year old child.Late ArrivalsPrompt: Who is someone you look up to and why?  There are many different people that come in and out of your life. All of them teach you different things. Some come in to teach you how to survive, and others just to mess your life up. Many of the people that stay are the ones who love you and the ones you learn to love. The very two first people that will teach you everything are your parents. My prime example is my dad.  My dad is literally a pain in the neck when it comes to my studies and school work. He�s always on my back when he comes home from work. �Kevin get off your phone, that�s not helping you study!� I always seem to make the same dumb mistake by saying,� yeah dad I did that already.� Usually he always likes checking my homework. He is such a perfectionist, doesn�t like not even the slightest mistake. My dad is also always asking about my grades. Like any other parent he turns into a loud parakeet and yells at me if I have a bad grade, but never does he hit me for any reason. My dad has probably taught me the most valuable things in life. When he was only fifteen years old, he was in the army back in El Salvador. After one year he decided to run away from the military and flee his country. When he arrived to the U.S. his mom told him he had to work, because she didn�t have enough money for the both of them. My dad has been independent ever since. He always tells me how I should value my life and that I should appreciate that I have both my parents. With my dad I can play around but he�s also showed me when it�s time to be serious. My dad is like my mentor. He always pesters me about how I shouldn�t do a lot of the things he did, because he doesn�t want to see me suffering like he did.  This man has always been there for me. Blood is thicker than water they say, and my dad has proved that to me. There�s never a time I don�t like going out to work with my dad. he�s taught me so much of the things he knows. Always says that when he dies he wants me to be known the way he is. My dad has never given me a bad example. Yes he may drink and stuff but he always likes to do it behind our backs so we won�t see him. He�s never offered us anything and even though he says you should try a lot of things at least once, the way he�s raised me I could never. He has always been there for me and my family. Never had we had to suffer the way he did. There�s always been a roof on our heads, clothes on our body, and food in our mouth. He may not seem like a big deal to you, but when I grow up I want to be just like my dad and if possible even better.  I�m very lucky to have a man like that in life. He has always stuck by my side no matter what. My dad has taught me what it�s like to be a man. All the memories he�s given me I will never forget. All the stories he�s told me I hope to pass down to my kids. I want my dad to be remembered for an eternity. I look up to my dad because he�s the greatest dad alive!I am uniquely qualified as a vet because of my love for animal�s, past experience and achieving my goals and accomplishments. My passion for animals is to love them in many ways, giving them their different needs. Figuring out the problems by performing good connections and communication. I am willing to heal the broken hearts and outer skins on the helpless animals and not only the pets but the pet owners.  In my 19 years I�ve grown up with pets all my life, so I am aware of the requirements into keeping a pet and providing the right care for them, I�ve learned that every day I am learning something new about different species and still want to continue to gain new knowledge.  Studying animals all my life has also made me want to participate in an actual animal shelter, and maybe my own someday, I plan to better myself into the new things that come my way to help these animals and teach others the right way.essayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessayessay12Embed;

I've been talkin' smokin', Loud statements DJ with the drop on him, Shuffle on the floor like house ravers You rhyme words together really well That's why the people love you, but that's just one piece of the secret puzzle That's like missin' the sea cause you see the puddle That's where you seem to struggle You perform like your knees were buckled if you even push up a feeble muscle YOU let him do this with no conviction Just like if someone looks like him finds himself in legal trouble He stays insecure, stood on the spot lookin' like he needs a cuddle as he speaks so discrete and subtle That's why we don't believe in ya So many elite MC's that leagues above ya We don't in Shuffle like the deal's a hustle You get it, but that ain't the gamblin' part I told Briggzy we're gonna need a proper Shuffle or it's gonna damage the card You think pretending to not have an ego is the cheat code Like it's an invincible spell He thinks that if any MC is givin' him hell he just needs to giggle as well and it isn't an L All that nonchalant shit of you bein' the biggest you could be If you don't believe it, we don't believe it as well I mean all that self deprecating only made you be little (belittle) yourself Second round in, safe star bless Only one more round and plenty more space in that graveyard left [Round 2: Shuffle T]  {Shuffle pulls out his phone}  "Hey, yeah, um, can I speak to someone in HR? Yeah it's to deal with well-being and safeguards 2-9-1-5 is the number on my name card My place of work is Shotty Horroh�s Graveyard My complaints are - I never get told when a new shipment of bodies is coming in...which is a great start I just have to wait for them to magically pop up on my radar And I think he�s in denial cause, I know where the graves are And he always saying that he isn't, but he is running out of space fast If we ask too many questions he forces us out He turns up some days and orders us 'round He was meant to be in for a meeting at a quarter to...now Some are saying he won�t show up That�s what people are saying It's a hassle, it's a stress, it's havoc, it's a mess I just get batches of the dead turn up through National Express And if I ask how they died that�s a sackable offence Am I to believe that he...What? Rap battles them to death? I�m calling today cause I�ve just had someone through, Tali Another hopeless victim And I�m looking around and I�ve got no idea for the life of me where I�m s�posed to fit him Plot 3? No that�s taken. It�s taken it don�t need filling Well, I can put Tali in there but he�s going to have Tony with him I get that these things are best handled with stealth It�s just - it�s extra stress for me, which is bad for my health But I guess I�ve just got to deal with the hand I was dealt What was your name? Alright, Briggzy, well thanks for your help." Listen, I'm glad he's laughin', cause usually he's terrifying When he does smile, his Face ID doesn�t recognize him That, and you've put on a [?] amount of weight A bit of padding around the face You're the man of the house, it's great I bet your calorie count's insane But I'm not intimidated by you, that wasn't how I was raised I don't feel fear next to you, I just feel massively out of shape Now, he DID beat me in that film VS � but it was hard for me to lose that Cause I first wrote my side of the battle they said, �We can�t really use that It needs to be WORSE than Shotty�s material, so can you write us a new rap?� I said, �WORSE than Shotty�s stuff�? I don�t know if I can do that.� In the end I had to go through about 100,000 scripts To make my stuff as bad as what�s coming out that fucking mouth of his At one point I just screwed up a piece of paper and rubbed it 'round in shit The director said, �I think we�ll need to dumb it down a bit.� I was in 8 Mile as well, you seen it? Ahh, it's genius as fuck Producer called me personally said, �We need you for this, Shuff� I was meant to lose to Eminem, but the scenes have all been cut Apparently, me getting beat wasn�t �believable enough� Now listen, me and funny go together like bees and honey Easy money, Heretic and a vegan curry But it�s an understatement if you're describing me as �hungry� That�s like calling Ian Huntley a �cheeky monkey� I feel so comfy up here, I�m winning this in every round I should be getting out my armchair, slippers and a dressing gown You should bring Briggzy in as well, man! Fuck it, just for a laugh We can turn this in to a 1v1 and a half Cause look at all the people that you have to bring with you The second that a battle�s not inside of the M62 I could�ve had this battle in your house in your parent�s living room And have them both arguing over who they�d give it to Your mom gives it to me So, if I were you, I would honestly hide in a safe space Because this could cost you your life and that is fucking mate�s rates I am in here to have a couple of quick beers and slay I don�t care if the Sharks or the Knights are the ones that win here today Don�t get that misconstrued, I mean MY win�s clear on stage I just don�t care about the teams, cause I�m not 6 years of age Every performance I have out of 10 I give myself a million I am my own worst critic and I think I�m fucking brilliant! So fuck it, the round's done, I got his back to the turnbuckle Let�s all see how many puns this cunt has for the word �shuffle� Time  [Round 3: Shotty Horroh] I mean Shuffle T's funny as fuck I've been quotin' him when he's roastin' them As far as the stand up comedy rap battle fans go, it's either O'shea or him to be the GOAT for them But there's this Joe Pesci notion... Funny how? If you focusin' Cause there's two types of funny in this world bro and you're both of 'em Cause you're funny, like you're funny when they're lovin' your clowin' But you're funny like there's really somethin' funny about him Cause I don't fuck my friends over You get bad luck from it Pussy try bein' a stand up guy before you try bein' a stand up comic Cause no matter what Cruger and Bags do for this lad, you know he's team Rowan forever He literally robbed your friends of their business pursuit as he DM'd you, you instantly fold to the pressure He's payin' you with the money that he owes to them...don't act like you didn't know any better Crazy that you made a paperback when you was the staple that didn't have the spine to hold it together He does not give a fuck I've never met anybody as bold as he is Can you imagine him, Cruger and Bagnall on Zoom if they host a meetin' for the Sound Like show that evenin'? And he's tangent off to Don't Flop, the whole case, the whole proceedings He sat there like, "What a cunt. What a cunt. Sorry guys that's my phone. Hello Roooooo- Hello Ronan Keating Boys I have Ronan Keating." He does not give a fuck, you have to understand That shit he did with Liam and Freddie, that shit made 'em sick, they ain't just anybodys Without them, I don't think the scene you see today exists I'm not saying you're a piece of shit cause you didn't hold it down I'm just sayin', you ain't legit Cause he tried doin' the same shit to my brother, and we squaded up and created this Loyal to the soil I don't fuck with anybody that wants to play with Briggz You don't like him, I don't you, simple, plain as shit That's why our careers meet at a fork in the road, and they separate, like this Cause you're still maintainin' a main event career and gettin' a wage from it And I'm the guy that pays you it And I did your little panel show for free twice It was COVID times I let the love persuade me You couldn't sell tickets, make money, there was no crowd, stuff was crazy You came at me with the whole "we're friends" angle and I [?] Cause me charging Shuffle shady Until we needed you during the pandemic and your attitude was "fuck you pay me" So fuck Shuffle T and his book and his infiltrating, gentrification in a class These posh cunts can't see what the streets created with the scraps And wanna turn it into data and a [?] "Click this link and learn how to be hip hop" FUCK OFF! We ain't got the patience for all a dat For your book to be useful to me, I'd have to tape it to my abs so I was safe from gettin' stabbed I didn't learn this shift from a fuckin' book I was battlin' on the street corner since I had a bus pass and pocket full of dust caps People hated, FUCK THAT I handled the positive and the negative like a blood bank Me versus you, 1 on 1 ain't a good match Cause I've always been a couple points above you like a umlaut Next thing I wanna talk about is very fuckin' serious It's not a joke Cause I don't trust a man who's arms don't move when he walks It's one of those Why do your arms look so heavy bro? I gotta know You look like every single [?] trying to carry your mum's worth of shopping home Fuckin' strange guy Lookin' like the little Men In Black alien inside him can't operate the arms and the legs at the same time And thank you very much Another straight, white, male with a podcast With long hair and edgy jokes It's fuckin' Russel off-Brand  That's me, thank you  [Round 3: Shuffle T] Now your music has actually been a little different lately When you up and switch so fucking quick it comes across as shady That Scum Of The Earth album was so Oasis influenced it was crazy I said, �Do you think you might have ripped them off a bit?� He said �mayyyyyybeeeeeeee!" I said, �Yeah, Definitely Maybe Here�s what I think happened, I think you started copying them 'Little By Little' Then you just 'Roll With It' Head up in the clouds I mean he doesn�t hear it It makes him wonder what all ('Wonderwall') the fuss is about No one�s more pissed off than me, I liked how your old albums sound In fact, I don�t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now 'Don't Look Back In Anger' You blended Brit pop and hip hop with rock Thought it would be shit hot, big shock, it�s not You ripped off a band you like, and yeah you did it beautifully But musically, now you�re nowhere near as good as it used to be Cause when you sell out your art for a dime It�ll never be far from your mind Cause when you�ve been cast to the side those steps are a bastard to climb You�re energy starved and you�ll try, but never regrasp on those heights Your penmanship starts to decline, your presence your bars and your lines And everything�s harder to rhyme Integrity�s hard to define But when you pretend to be part of a life Of the celebrity�s art that you like All you�re doing is karaoke, you dress up you dance and you mime So, all you�ve actually done is perfected the art of disguise That�s why you�re running out of smoke like a contestant on Stars In Their Eyes Tonight Matthew, I�m going to shove Noel�s Gallagher�s dick in every hole that it can fit The only role that you can give, this ain�t a cold slap on the wrist You�re facing the whole character list of Soul Caliber 6 That�s why he�s saying shit lines these days like "It Tali and (Italian) blood run in the streets", oh my God, you're such a prick The Manny crowd were loving it, most people wouldn�t fuck with it I was just watching with a confused face, I couldn�t keep up with it Not because it's too complex, just cause it's fucking shit "Italian blood running the streets" � I�ll slow down I�m out maneuvering I'm gettin' a bit too complex so let me do some tutoring See I said something about the mafia, but I included in his pseudonym I don�t give a shit if you crammed his name in there it still has fuck all to do with him Let me say something simple and make it official Battle rap bars aren't personal cause their name or initial was placed in the middle Every round from you these days is just this crazy horrid scheme You make it sound complex but it�s always just the same obnoxious theme People used to be able to battle in a way they�d want to speak Whatever happened to just fucking saying what you mean? Every line it�s �I said one thing that sounds like another thing. Isn't that clever?� I�m just watching from the side like �Mate. It isn�t that clever.� So, I won�t dress this up with word play I�ll just tell you what the truth is I think insecurity is the reason you became a unit Your battles aren�t that great these days, neither is your music I think you�re overrated, and I think you�re fuckin' stupid This is loud-mouth bullshit versus strong and silent You make something simple feel like rocket science I make rocket science feel like comic timing Like Hugh Laurie, The Two Ronnies or Monty Python It doesn�t make an ounce of difference how you spin it Which way round you flip it, upside down and twisted I am bound to win this, and the crowd can witness This counterfeited coward�s limits There�s always praise for you and you�re showered with it Put on a pedestal like some proud exhibit They put you in the top 4 they�ve mapped out your image Well, you can have Mount Rushmore I�ll take Mount Olympus You say I�m a clown as if it means that I�m annoyed I love that reputation, that's my pride and joy So, go find some 'roids, alright? Enjoy! Take that belt to its biting point I�ll just kick you in the bollocks with my clown shoes so hard you�ll have a higher voice than a choirboy�s! If you�re watching from overseas � watch more UK battle rap Watch Frankie, Frost, Oshea, Cojay, Gemini, It�s action packed Watch Premier Battles, Don't Flop, No Loose Chat, fuck it - watch some Danny Jaqq Just stop giving all your attention to this overrated fuckin' twat! See, I beat you with word play, angles, aggression, concepts, this battle�s what I make it You just forever rely on Americanized generically rhymed name flips You�re an imitator � you see what�s out there and you claim it I�m an innovator � I see what�s out there and I change it TimeEmbed;

Come Together - Remastered 2009;The Beatles;rock; RZA - He slayed it. And everybody knew it. And everybody else tried to slay. But he slayed it2. Did Ol' Dirty really live up to the craziness that he portrayed in his music?   RZA - Times ten3. What happened first, you naming yourself RZA or your cousin naming himself GZA?  RZA - I named myself the RZA first, and I named him the GZA shortly thereafter4. Did anything inspire you with regards to the choice of beats on Enter the 36 Chambers? Also, are you still an avid chess player? :D  RZA - On 36 Chambers, I kind of went on my own inspiration. I was out to prove my abilities. Yes, I still play chess5. Will we ever get 36 chambers remastered?  RZA - Perhaps some of the tracks will be remastered. A lot of them are probably not in multitrack form anymore. So the remaster would still have to come from a stereo mix6. Ever give any thought to writing/directing a Wu Tang Clan movie to tie in with an album?  RZA - Yes, actually. Although making movies is very difficult and it's hard to get green lights, I'm going to keep pushing though. And maybe one day, it will see the light7. Do I still have to protect ma neck? It's been like 20 years now, I'm getting tired of doing it Love you man. As a producer, as a rapper, as an actor, as a videogame character, ANY dj  RZA - You have to protect ya neck til the day you drop brother. Because if you lose ya neck, that will be the day you drop! You must always protect ya neck at all times8. Long time fan of the Wu. I was amazed by the Kill Bill soundtracks Don't know if you can answer this: Will the Ghostface/MF DOOM album ever be released?  RZA - I don't know. But Ghost is one of the dopest MCs, and MF is a dope producer and MC. So I'm sure if they do it, it's going to be great9. What's your favorite movie, and why is it How High?  RZA - Hahahahaheeehohohahaha. Lay off the drugs, cat. LOL10. I have some beat production related questions: - What's your usual setup? All digital? Any analog instruments? Vinyl sampling?   - What DAW do you prefer? -Do you make beats, then send the finished product to rappers to write lyrics to it or do you usually write the song together? - Do you have a specific process for finding samples, or is it all gut feeling? RZA - Well, that's a lot, but: not being egotistic about this, but I have a dozen set ups. And my home studio I use different rooms for setups. So one room is just turntables and a sampler, another would be just keyboards, another will be a digital room, there's one room where everything is analog (live drums, guitars, etc). As a composer, you always need different sounds, so after working with Hans Zimmer, I've learned to use different rooms to write different things or different scenes  I prefer writing songs together. In fact one of the problems with making a Wu-Tang album is my refusal to send beats, because I believe that great music is created when people are in a room together  I dig and I dig, and if something strikes my ear, I sample it. Then I twist it11. PEACE Do you still wear those pointy ass rings and have you ever actually punched a hole in a crab's hand with them?  RZA - No. I gave them to my little brother and I think he lost em12. Do you need to be self aware in order to have sex for enjoyment?  RZA - Uh oh. It's getting deep on AMA. We said AMAA. But now that you asked, you better be aware of yourself and your partner(s)13. How did you like your time on Californication? Samurai Apocalypse was a great foil to Hank Moody  RZA - It was very fun. Funny. And something was very sexy about that show. Maybe it was Meagan. LOL14. Hey RZA! Tell us some funny stories from u and the guys in Wu Tang: )  RZA - Here's a story, it may not be funny depending on your point of view, but one time the whole Clan was in Atlanta, and I guess we caused some kind of riot in the building, and thus the police was brought in to end the show. I remember everybody getting away from the cops without any violence, but one cop had got a grab of Inspector Deck and he couldn't get free. When we noticed it, me and Method Man rushed back over to help, but actually, what could we do? We can't hit a cop, could we? That would not have been wise. Instead, Method Man grabbed onto Inspector Deck's arm, and combined his strength with Inspector Deck, which allowed them to get away from the cop, they broke his grip and we all ran. I later told Meth "That was some Wu-Tang Kung fu shit right there."15. How was working with Earl Sweatshirt? I've heard that during the making of Molasses, you spit a freestyle for three hours  RZA - Yeah, we got zoned out that night. He's a cool cat. And I think he will be a great talent in hiphop16. Hey RZA, how did you become a vegetarian?  RZA - I just snapped out of eating dead animals17. BONG BONG! Been a fan for 20+ years 2 questions: Whats your all time favorite Martial Arts flick? What is your favorite ODB verse/line/metaphor/song?  RZA - I'll tell you the 3 that inspired me the most. Shaolin versus Wu-Tang. 8 Diagram Pole Fighter. And the Five Deadly Venoms For ODB "I be the answer to your why, the tear to your cry." It's off a song he did with Killer Priest18. Who's the best chess player in the Wu Tang Clan right now?  RZA - Hahahahahahaha. All I can say is that I had the hiphop chess belt19. What was it about Gravediggaz, and the horrorcore genre in general, that appealed to you when it was first starting? RZA - At the time, being young and thinking of my childhood nightmares, I wanted to write songs from the darker side of my mentality. I feel like the Gravediggaz are the pioneers of this mentality of lyricism. Hiphop could use a few more doses of it now20. Hey RZA! You seem to be a very calculated, meditative and, for lack of a better word, spiritual person. Was there a certain event in your life that led you to be this way or is this the way you've always been? Peace & thanks for the AMA  RZA - Yes, certain events led me to this, which is hard for me to describe to this, which are hard to describe. But I can say that it was a growth process. Would you believe I was once obnoxious21. Can you share any memories of your tour with Rage Against the Machine?  RZA - That was one of the highlights of my career. At the time, Wu-Tang had the #1 album in the country, and we began playing some of the biggest venues that we had to that date. One of my best memories is when Zack broke his leg on tour, and needed a little energy during the New Jersey show, and I came out and rocked the stage with him. The rest of the Wu went home. :(22. Have you considered being on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast? I can't remember if it was a tweet or during his own AMA, but Rogan said he would love to have you on as a guest  RZA - Yes, I would love to be on as a guest someday. I'll wait for the time for him to invite me23. Hey RZA! really glad you're doing this AMA. I read somewhere that you and John Frusciante have recorded a ton of material. I really liked FM. Any chance you two might release a full album in the future? That would be awesome  RZA - here's a chance for that. If life permits24. actor in Brick Mansions. AMAA Hey hey now, let's not forget the awesome performance in "The Man with the Iron Fists!" Good job man. How much fun is it being so versatile?  RZA - It's very challenging. Because some of my friends are thinking I'm becoming a little schizo. Wow, the life of an artist25. I was recently in a yoga class and the instructor said "protect your neck" and I immediately thought of Wu-Tang and giggled to myself. What do you think about a rap-inspired yoga class? Would bring a whole new meaning to "flow."  RZA - LOL26. Many critics believe double albums usually contain filler and do not hold them as in high of regard as they could and should be. What would you say were the main reasons "Wu-Tang Forever" was made into a Double album instead of 2 different albums with a later release date for songs not used on first album? Was some of the inspiration for making it a double album taken from the success of "All Eyez on Me" or more that you wanted to get more music out?  RZA - Actually, a double-album was part creative, and part business. If i can recall, we hadn't done an album as Wu-Tang Clan for four years. And so we wanted to give Steve Rifkin an abundant amount of material. But also we demanded a budget so high that to appease it, they said "how about a double album?"27. Prince Rakeem! Just wanted to give you a shout out for saving my life (or at least my wallet) way back when 12 years ago, I�m serving a Mormon mission in Brazil. I�m assigned to a poverty stricken area of Curitiba, a city of about 2 million people. I�m 20 years old, young enough to think I�m invincible and stupid enough to not heed the advice to stay out of this particular neighborhood. This is one of those �favelas� that you hear about in the news. Houses made of plywood, cardboard and tarp; a river of feces, trash and decaying dog carcasses; red dirt roads that turn into streams during rainstorms and a whole lot of people walking around that didn�t really have anything to do other than observe those who didn�t belong. This is the same place where you read about nightly murders in the newspaper. The problem was, this neighborhood was right in the middle of our area and it made it difficult to get from one side to the other without passing through. Although my mission companion and I had been through the neighborhood a handful of times during the day, we had never ventured to pass through at night Well, this night a meeting of ours goes particularly late at night and we are dead tired after a long day. From where we were, we were going to have to walk around the outside of the favela to get home and that was about an hour-long walk. Instead, we decide to cut through the favela to cut it down to about 20 minutes. At first, the decision seems like the right one. The moonlight is blanketing the road, the night is freezing but still, and even though there is always the lingering stench of rotting dogs, it just isn�t that bad tonight. The road we choose to walk down is the same one we�ve used in the past, but now that it�s night I start to realize some things I hadn�t before. The road is like a chute, without any roads intersecting it. It�s like a long hallway of back-to-back shanties and decaying cement buildings with no exit other than the two ends. As we walk, I start to see figures in the shadows ahead on both sides of the road. As we get closer, the figures start to meander to the middle of the road. My companion, who has only been in Brazil for about a month is oblivious to anything going on. I casually look behind me to reconsider our choice of road, and I see five figures, evenly spaced across the road, walking toward us. I turn back and see the figures ahead of us have formed a line across the road as well. By this point, even my na�ve little friend knows we�re screwed. As we approach the group I notice that the men all wearing heavy black clothing: big coats, baggy jeans, boots, hoodies, winter caps. But one detail struck me immediately. All of them are wearing at least one article of clothing bearing an emblem I knew very well. It was the Wu-Tang logo. Mind you, I was obsessed with Wu-Tang in high school and knew pretty much anything there was to know about the group. As we stop, looking the men in the face, the lines of men behind and in front of us meet to form a circle around us. The man directly in front of us asks, �Perdidos?� and the man to his left reaches into his coat and begins to pull out what looks like the back of a black semi-automatic handgun. Before he pulls the gun from his coat, I almost subconsciously blurt out the only thing I could think to say: in Portuguese, I ask �You guys are Wu-Tang fans?� The man pulling the gun immediately pauses. The man who first spoke asks �What do YOU know about Wu-Tang?� I respond by telling him that I�m a huge fan and I know all about them. Obviously they doubt everything I�m saying. After all, I�m a white kid, wearing a white shirt and tie, with a part in my hair. At that moment I began to realize how I wouldn�t believe myself either. They begin to quiz me! One thing after another�names, nicknames, alternate names, rapping styles�I�m nailing it all! After about 10 minutes of Wu-Tang trivia, they�re convinced and they ask us to come back to one of the guy�s house to watch the latest video. They told us repeatedly how we were the coolest white people they knew From that day on, we were in with the local gang and you really don�t know just how good of a thing that was Edit: Thank you for reading this novel and spreading the love, gold-wielding friend--whoever you are Edit 2: Someone below asked if there was more to the story. If your eyes can take a little more reading, I explained how the night ended here  RZA - Wow I always believed that us who follow the way of the Wu have a wavelength and a culture of our own. Something like a subculture within hiphop. This story helps verify that for me. Wu-Tang forever brother28. Will you ever release a real true solo wu sounding album just like the others did in the 90's??? not discrediting the bobby digital stuff, i like that but a lot of wu fans felt it wasn't a true representation of the 90's rza, hard body lyrics and dusty beats, will that ever happen or does everything need to move forward? i jst wish i had a rza album full of songs like Tragedy RZA - Hmm. Maybe brother, maybe29. Wu-Tang Forever! How much have comic books influenced you? I still smile every time I hear you name drop Rom, The Space Knight on Impossible  RZA - From the age of 9-16, I probably collected thousands of comics. But they all got stolen one day, along with my vinyl collection. And I'm telling you, I used to spend my paper route money on this stuff. I'm still a comic fan. Every once in a while, if I'm in a certain city and they have a comic book store, I will go and pick up a few copies. I love how the new artists are doing the new covers, Grant Morrison's take on classic heroes has always been cool to me, and I actually bought every copy of Reginald Hudlin's new take on the Black Panther30. Whattup Rza huge Wu Fan and personally you are my favourite producer ever!Thank you for doing this, I have a few questions actually, my first question regards the tracks Method Man and Clan In Da front, Did you tailor a beat for every member in the clan, how did you choose who got their solo songs on the album?Who are your other favourite rapper-producers?Lastly are there any beats that once you had finished then played back you realised that it was going to be a classic.Once again thank you!  RZA - Yes, I used to tailor the beats to their rhyme styles. I knew my Wu brothers for so long, and made so many tapes with them, that I grew an ear to what would fit the MC Choosing solo songs for each artist on a Wu-Tang album is something that kind of materializes during the process Pete Rock, Dr. Dre, Kanye West Yes, I have one right now that I just can't wait til the Wu MCs get on, because I just know that this is one of those magical ones31. Which rappers are you listening to the most outside of your Wu-Tang crew?  RZA - Nowadays, I've just become a fan of the culture of hiphop. Somedays I find myself sitting on my downtime watching Yo! MTV raps, or scrolling through YouTube finding up and coming MCs. I love watching URL and all the rap battles. Sometimes when you're making the music, you become so engulfed in yourself that you forget that you started yourself as a fan of the music. Now that I get time to do other things such as act, score and direct, I can actually become a fan of hiphop again32. What is your relationship with Bill Murray like? You guys were in Coffee and Cigarettes in 2003, and then in 2010, this happened. Do you still talk?  RZA - I don't talk to him often, because we both have crazy-busy schedules, but we have a similar circle of friends. What I can say is what a cool dude33. What's good RZA. First shoutout to /r/hiphopheads. How do you stay creative as you do lyrically and production wise?  RZA - I use life as inspiration. And being that I travel a lot, and see a lot of different things, and meet a lot of great people, I stay inspired. Shoutout to /r/hiphopheads34. Could you elaborate on your infamous flood story? The legend says that you once had a flood into your basement that caused you to lose a few hundred beats you had made that were meant to be put onto the first round of Wu-Tang solo albums Did this actually happen? Did you recreate any of the beats that you lost? If so, which ones?  RZA - Yeah, I lost a lot of beats. In those days, I would keep my beats in a floppy disk holder, which held 80 disks per case. And I had the cases sectioned out with names of each Wu member, and beats that fit their styles. Those disks have not been recovered yet. I have some of them, but they won't play35. Hey RZA, Huge Fan here, I've been listening to you since I was 10. One question Are you not going to publically publish songs off the new WuTang albulm, or will it only be avaliable to the one lucky buyer?  RZA - The album, that's entitled A Better Tomorrow, if completed, will be available to the public. The album entitled Once Upon A Time in Shaolin is a piece of art that only one will be made36. When was the last time you saw Paul Walker?  RZA - The last time I saw Paul in the flesh was on the movie set. We had planned on seeing each other again at the premiere. But destiny bends37. How awesome is it being a Robert? (Mine name is Robert)  RZA - Super duper awesome38. How did you come up with the name RZA?  RZA - In my neighborhood, my homies would call me the RZA RZA Ra. Because they said I was razor-sharp. Ra was my chosen name, short for Rakeem. When I decided to improve myself, I changed my name to Rakeem Zig-Zag-Zig-Allah. And RZA is like an acronym for that39. What's your favourite videogame?  RZA - Nowadays? Well it's hard to say your favorite video game, but one game I've been buying for years and continue to buy every version they make is Tekken. Actually, when Wu-Tang first started making money, me and Method Man came to Manhattan and went to the place where they sell real pinball machines and video games, and we tried to buy a Tekken to bring home to our house. And they wouldn't sell it to us at that time. Method Man would up getting one though. I wound up getting a pinball machine. Anyway, Tekken40. You get a swimming pool but you can't fill it with water, what do you fill it with? Money is not a choice either  RZA - Those little plastic balls that you see in ball pits41. Liquid Swords II when? Btw Liquid Swords is the greatest Hip-Hop album of all time  RZA - I think GZA may be in the process of writing that nowYou might also like1Embed;

Did Ol' Dirty really live up to the craziness that he portrayed in his music?   RZA - Times ten3. What happened first, you naming yourself RZA or your cousin naming himself GZA?  RZA - I named myself the RZA first, and I named him the GZA shortly thereafter4. Did anything inspire you with regards to the choice of beats on Enter the 36 Chambers? Also, are you still an avid chess player? :D  RZA - On 36 Chambers, I kind of went on my own inspiration. I was out to prove my abilities. Yes, I still play chess5. Will we ever get 36 chambers remastered?  RZA - Perhaps some of the tracks will be remastered. A lot of them are probably not in multitrack form anymore. So the remaster would still have to come from a stereo mix6. Ever give any thought to writing/directing a Wu Tang Clan movie to tie in with an album?  RZA - Yes, actually. Although making movies is very difficult and it's hard to get green lights, I'm going to keep pushing though. And maybe one day, it will see the light7. Do I still have to protect ma neck? It's been like 20 years now, I'm getting tired of doing it Love you man. As a producer, as a rapper, as an actor, as a videogame character, ANY dj  RZA - You have to protect ya neck til the day you drop brother. Because if you lose ya neck, that will be the day you drop! You must always protect ya neck at all times8. Long time fan of the Wu. I was amazed by the Kill Bill soundtracks Don't know if you can answer this: Will the Ghostface/MF DOOM album ever be released?  RZA - I don't know. But Ghost is one of the dopest MCs, and MF is a dope producer and MC. So I'm sure if they do it, it's going to be great9. What's your favorite movie, and why is it How High?  RZA - Hahahahaheeehohohahaha. Lay off the drugs, cat. LOL10. I have some beat production related questions: - What's your usual setup? All digital? Any analog instruments? Vinyl sampling?   - What DAW do you prefer? -Do you make beats, then send the finished product to rappers to write lyrics to it or do you usually write the song together? - Do you have a specific process for finding samples, or is it all gut feeling? RZA - Well, that's a lot, but: not being egotistic about this, but I have a dozen set ups. And my home studio I use different rooms for setups. So one room is just turntables and a sampler, another would be just keyboards, another will be a digital room, there's one room where everything is analog (live drums, guitars, etc). As a composer, you always need different sounds, so after working with Hans Zimmer, I've learned to use different rooms to write different things or different scenes  I prefer writing songs together. In fact one of the problems with making a Wu-Tang album is my refusal to send beats, because I believe that great music is created when people are in a room together  I dig and I dig, and if something strikes my ear, I sample it. Then I twist it11. PEACE Do you still wear those pointy ass rings and have you ever actually punched a hole in a crab's hand with them?  RZA - No. I gave them to my little brother and I think he lost em12. Do you need to be self aware in order to have sex for enjoyment?  RZA - Uh oh. It's getting deep on AMA. We said AMAA. But now that you asked, you better be aware of yourself and your partner(s)13. How did you like your time on Californication? Samurai Apocalypse was a great foil to Hank Moody  RZA - It was very fun. Funny. And something was very sexy about that show. Maybe it was Meagan. LOL14. Hey RZA! Tell us some funny stories from u and the guys in Wu Tang: )  RZA - Here's a story, it may not be funny depending on your point of view, but one time the whole Clan was in Atlanta, and I guess we caused some kind of riot in the building, and thus the police was brought in to end the show. I remember everybody getting away from the cops without any violence, but one cop had got a grab of Inspector Deck and he couldn't get free. When we noticed it, me and Method Man rushed back over to help, but actually, what could we do? We can't hit a cop, could we? That would not have been wise. Instead, Method Man grabbed onto Inspector Deck's arm, and combined his strength with Inspector Deck, which allowed them to get away from the cop, they broke his grip and we all ran. I later told Meth "That was some Wu-Tang Kung fu shit right there."15. How was working with Earl Sweatshirt? I've heard that during the making of Molasses, you spit a freestyle for three hours  RZA - Yeah, we got zoned out that night. He's a cool cat. And I think he will be a great talent in hiphop16. Hey RZA, how did you become a vegetarian?  RZA - I just snapped out of eating dead animals17. BONG BONG! Been a fan for 20+ years 2 questions: Whats your all time favorite Martial Arts flick? What is your favorite ODB verse/line/metaphor/song?  RZA - I'll tell you the 3 that inspired me the most. Shaolin versus Wu-Tang. 8 Diagram Pole Fighter. And the Five Deadly Venoms For ODB "I be the answer to your why, the tear to your cry." It's off a song he did with Killer Priest18. Who's the best chess player in the Wu Tang Clan right now?  RZA - Hahahahahahaha. All I can say is that I had the hiphop chess belt19. What was it about Gravediggaz, and the horrorcore genre in general, that appealed to you when it was first starting? RZA - At the time, being young and thinking of my childhood nightmares, I wanted to write songs from the darker side of my mentality. I feel like the Gravediggaz are the pioneers of this mentality of lyricism. Hiphop could use a few more doses of it now20. Hey RZA! You seem to be a very calculated, meditative and, for lack of a better word, spiritual person. Was there a certain event in your life that led you to be this way or is this the way you've always been? Peace & thanks for the AMA  RZA - Yes, certain events led me to this, which is hard for me to describe to this, which are hard to describe. But I can say that it was a growth process. Would you believe I was once obnoxious21. Can you share any memories of your tour with Rage Against the Machine?  RZA - That was one of the highlights of my career. At the time, Wu-Tang had the #1 album in the country, and we began playing some of the biggest venues that we had to that date. One of my best memories is when Zack broke his leg on tour, and needed a little energy during the New Jersey show, and I came out and rocked the stage with him. The rest of the Wu went home. :(22. Have you considered being on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast? I can't remember if it was a tweet or during his own AMA, but Rogan said he would love to have you on as a guest  RZA - Yes, I would love to be on as a guest someday. I'll wait for the time for him to invite me23. Hey RZA! really glad you're doing this AMA. I read somewhere that you and John Frusciante have recorded a ton of material. I really liked FM. Any chance you two might release a full album in the future? That would be awesome  RZA - here's a chance for that. If life permits24. actor in Brick Mansions. AMAA Hey hey now, let's not forget the awesome performance in "The Man with the Iron Fists!" Good job man. How much fun is it being so versatile?  RZA - It's very challenging. Because some of my friends are thinking I'm becoming a little schizo. Wow, the life of an artist25. I was recently in a yoga class and the instructor said "protect your neck" and I immediately thought of Wu-Tang and giggled to myself. What do you think about a rap-inspired yoga class? Would bring a whole new meaning to "flow."  RZA - LOL26. Many critics believe double albums usually contain filler and do not hold them as in high of regard as they could and should be. What would you say were the main reasons "Wu-Tang Forever" was made into a Double album instead of 2 different albums with a later release date for songs not used on first album? Was some of the inspiration for making it a double album taken from the success of "All Eyez on Me" or more that you wanted to get more music out?  RZA - Actually, a double-album was part creative, and part business. If i can recall, we hadn't done an album as Wu-Tang Clan for four years. And so we wanted to give Steve Rifkin an abundant amount of material. But also we demanded a budget so high that to appease it, they said "how about a double album?"27. Prince Rakeem! Just wanted to give you a shout out for saving my life (or at least my wallet) way back when 12 years ago, I�m serving a Mormon mission in Brazil. I�m assigned to a poverty stricken area of Curitiba, a city of about 2 million people. I�m 20 years old, young enough to think I�m invincible and stupid enough to not heed the advice to stay out of this particular neighborhood. This is one of those �favelas� that you hear about in the news. Houses made of plywood, cardboard and tarp; a river of feces, trash and decaying dog carcasses; red dirt roads that turn into streams during rainstorms and a whole lot of people walking around that didn�t really have anything to do other than observe those who didn�t belong. This is the same place where you read about nightly murders in the newspaper. The problem was, this neighborhood was right in the middle of our area and it made it difficult to get from one side to the other without passing through. Although my mission companion and I had been through the neighborhood a handful of times during the day, we had never ventured to pass through at night Well, this night a meeting of ours goes particularly late at night and we are dead tired after a long day. From where we were, we were going to have to walk around the outside of the favela to get home and that was about an hour-long walk. Instead, we decide to cut through the favela to cut it down to about 20 minutes. At first, the decision seems like the right one. The moonlight is blanketing the road, the night is freezing but still, and even though there is always the lingering stench of rotting dogs, it just isn�t that bad tonight. The road we choose to walk down is the same one we�ve used in the past, but now that it�s night I start to realize some things I hadn�t before. The road is like a chute, without any roads intersecting it. It�s like a long hallway of back-to-back shanties and decaying cement buildings with no exit other than the two ends. As we walk, I start to see figures in the shadows ahead on both sides of the road. As we get closer, the figures start to meander to the middle of the road. My companion, who has only been in Brazil for about a month is oblivious to anything going on. I casually look behind me to reconsider our choice of road, and I see five figures, evenly spaced across the road, walking toward us. I turn back and see the figures ahead of us have formed a line across the road as well. By this point, even my na�ve little friend knows we�re screwed. As we approach the group I notice that the men all wearing heavy black clothing: big coats, baggy jeans, boots, hoodies, winter caps. But one detail struck me immediately. All of them are wearing at least one article of clothing bearing an emblem I knew very well. It was the Wu-Tang logo. Mind you, I was obsessed with Wu-Tang in high school and knew pretty much anything there was to know about the group. As we stop, looking the men in the face, the lines of men behind and in front of us meet to form a circle around us. The man directly in front of us asks, �Perdidos?� and the man to his left reaches into his coat and begins to pull out what looks like the back of a black semi-automatic handgun. Before he pulls the gun from his coat, I almost subconsciously blurt out the only thing I could think to say: in Portuguese, I ask �You guys are Wu-Tang fans?� The man pulling the gun immediately pauses. The man who first spoke asks �What do YOU know about Wu-Tang?� I respond by telling him that I�m a huge fan and I know all about them. Obviously they doubt everything I�m saying. After all, I�m a white kid, wearing a white shirt and tie, with a part in my hair. At that moment I began to realize how I wouldn�t believe myself either. They begin to quiz me! One thing after another�names, nicknames, alternate names, rapping styles�I�m nailing it all! After about 10 minutes of Wu-Tang trivia, they�re convinced and they ask us to come back to one of the guy�s house to watch the latest video. They told us repeatedly how we were the coolest white people they knew From that day on, we were in with the local gang and you really don�t know just how good of a thing that was Edit: Thank you for reading this novel and spreading the love, gold-wielding friend--whoever you are Edit 2: Someone below asked if there was more to the story. If your eyes can take a little more reading, I explained how the night ended here  RZA - Wow I always believed that us who follow the way of the Wu have a wavelength and a culture of our own. Something like a subculture within hiphop. This story helps verify that for me. Wu-Tang forever brother28. Will you ever release a real true solo wu sounding album just like the others did in the 90's??? not discrediting the bobby digital stuff, i like that but a lot of wu fans felt it wasn't a true representation of the 90's rza, hard body lyrics and dusty beats, will that ever happen or does everything need to move forward? i jst wish i had a rza album full of songs like Tragedy RZA - Hmm. Maybe brother, maybe29. Wu-Tang Forever! How much have comic books influenced you? I still smile every time I hear you name drop Rom, The Space Knight on Impossible  RZA - From the age of 9-16, I probably collected thousands of comics. But they all got stolen one day, along with my vinyl collection. And I'm telling you, I used to spend my paper route money on this stuff. I'm still a comic fan. Every once in a while, if I'm in a certain city and they have a comic book store, I will go and pick up a few copies. I love how the new artists are doing the new covers, Grant Morrison's take on classic heroes has always been cool to me, and I actually bought every copy of Reginald Hudlin's new take on the Black Panther30. Whattup Rza huge Wu Fan and personally you are my favourite producer ever!Thank you for doing this, I have a few questions actually, my first question regards the tracks Method Man and Clan In Da front, Did you tailor a beat for every member in the clan, how did you choose who got their solo songs on the album?Who are your other favourite rapper-producers?Lastly are there any beats that once you had finished then played back you realised that it was going to be a classic.Once again thank you!  RZA - Yes, I used to tailor the beats to their rhyme styles. I knew my Wu brothers for so long, and made so many tapes with them, that I grew an ear to what would fit the MC Choosing solo songs for each artist on a Wu-Tang album is something that kind of materializes during the process Pete Rock, Dr. Dre, Kanye West Yes, I have one right now that I just can't wait til the Wu MCs get on, because I just know that this is one of those magical ones31. Which rappers are you listening to the most outside of your Wu-Tang crew?  RZA - Nowadays, I've just become a fan of the culture of hiphop. Somedays I find myself sitting on my downtime watching Yo! MTV raps, or scrolling through YouTube finding up and coming MCs. I love watching URL and all the rap battles. Sometimes when you're making the music, you become so engulfed in yourself that you forget that you started yourself as a fan of the music. Now that I get time to do other things such as act, score and direct, I can actually become a fan of hiphop again32. What is your relationship with Bill Murray like? You guys were in Coffee and Cigarettes in 2003, and then in 2010, this happened. Do you still talk?  RZA - I don't talk to him often, because we both have crazy-busy schedules, but we have a similar circle of friends. What I can say is what a cool dude33. What's good RZA. First shoutout to /r/hiphopheads. How do you stay creative as you do lyrically and production wise?  RZA - I use life as inspiration. And being that I travel a lot, and see a lot of different things, and meet a lot of great people, I stay inspired. Shoutout to /r/hiphopheads34. Could you elaborate on your infamous flood story?

The moonlight is blanketing the road, the night is freezing but still, and even though there is always the lingering stench of rotting dogs, it just isn�t that bad tonight. The road we choose to walk down is the same one we�ve used in the past, but now that it�s night I start to realize some things I hadn�t before. The road is like a chute, without any roads intersecting it. It�s like a long hallway of back-to-back shanties and decaying cement buildings with no exit other than the two ends. As we walk, I start to see figures in the shadows ahead on both sides of the road. As we get closer, the figures start to meander to the middle of the road. My companion, who has only been in Brazil for about a month is oblivious to anything going on. I casually look behind me to reconsider our choice of road, and I see five figures, evenly spaced across the road, walking toward us. I turn back and see the figures ahead of us have formed a line across the road as well. By this point, even my na�ve little friend knows we�re screwed. As we approach the group I notice that the men all wearing heavy black clothing: big coats, baggy jeans, boots, hoodies, winter caps. But one detail struck me immediately. All of them are wearing at least one article of clothing bearing an emblem I knew very well. It was the Wu-Tang logo. Mind you, I was obsessed with Wu-Tang in high school and knew pretty much anything there was to know about the group. As we stop, looking the men in the face, the lines of men behind and in front of us meet to form a circle around us. The man directly in front of us asks, �Perdidos?� and the man to his left reaches into his coat and begins to pull out what looks like the back of a black semi-automatic handgun. Before he pulls the gun from his coat, I almost subconsciously blurt out the only thing I could think to say: in Portuguese, I ask �You guys are Wu-Tang fans?� The man pulling the gun immediately pauses. The man who first spoke asks �What do YOU know about Wu-Tang?� I respond by telling him that I�m a huge fan and I know all about them. Obviously they doubt everything I�m saying. After all, I�m a white kid, wearing a white shirt and tie, with a part in my hair. At that moment I began to realize how I wouldn�t believe myself either. They begin to quiz me! One thing after another�names, nicknames, alternate names, rapping styles�I�m nailing it all! After about 10 minutes of Wu-Tang trivia, they�re convinced and they ask us to come back to one of the guy�s house to watch the latest video. They told us repeatedly how we were the coolest white people they knew From that day on, we were in with the local gang and you really don�t know just how good of a thing that was Edit: Thank you for reading this novel and spreading the love, gold-wielding friend--whoever you are Edit 2: Someone below asked if there was more to the story. If your eyes can take a little more reading, I explained how the night ended here  RZA - Wow I always believed that us who follow the way of the Wu have a wavelength and a culture of our own. Something like a subculture within hiphop. This story helps verify that for me. Wu-Tang forever brother28. Will you ever release a real true solo wu sounding album just like the others did in the 90's??? not discrediting the bobby digital stuff, i like that but a lot of wu fans felt it wasn't a true representation of the 90's rza, hard body lyrics and dusty beats, will that ever happen or does everything need to move forward? i jst wish i had a rza album full of songs like Tragedy RZA - Hmm. Maybe brother, maybe29. Wu-Tang Forever! How much have comic books influenced you? I still smile every time I hear you name drop Rom, The Space Knight on Impossible  RZA - From the age of 9-16, I probably collected thousands of comics. But they all got stolen one day, along with my vinyl collection. And I'm telling you, I used to spend my paper route money on this stuff. I'm still a comic fan. Every once in a while, if I'm in a certain city and they have a comic book store, I will go and pick up a few copies. I love how the new artists are doing the new covers, Grant Morrison's take on classic heroes has always been cool to me, and I actually bought every copy of Reginald Hudlin's new take on the Black Panther30. Whattup Rza huge Wu Fan and personally you are my favourite producer ever!Thank you for doing this, I have a few questions actually, my first question regards the tracks Method Man and Clan In Da front, Did you tailor a beat for every member in the clan, how did you choose who got their solo songs on the album?Who are your other favourite rapper-producers?Lastly are there any beats that once you had finished then played back you realised that it was going to be a classic.Once again thank you!  RZA - Yes, I used to tailor the beats to their rhyme styles. I knew my Wu brothers for so long, and made so many tapes with them, that I grew an ear to what would fit the MC Choosing solo songs for each artist on a Wu-Tang album is something that kind of materializes during the process Pete Rock, Dr. Dre, Kanye West Yes, I have one right now that I just can't wait til the Wu MCs get on, because I just know that this is one of those magical ones31. Which rappers are you listening to the most outside of your Wu-Tang crew?  RZA - Nowadays, I've just become a fan of the culture of hiphop. Somedays I find myself sitting on my downtime watching Yo! MTV raps, or scrolling through YouTube finding up and coming MCs. I love watching URL and all the rap battles. Sometimes when you're making the music, you become so engulfed in yourself that you forget that you started yourself as a fan of the music. Now that I get time to do other things such as act, score and direct, I can actually become a fan of hiphop again32. What is your relationship with Bill Murray like? You guys were in Coffee and Cigarettes in 2003, and then in 2010, this happened. Do you still talk?  RZA - I don't talk to him often, because we both have crazy-busy schedules, but we have a similar circle of friends. What I can say is what a cool dude33. What's good RZA. First shoutout to /r/hiphopheads. How do you stay creative as you do lyrically and production wise?  RZA - I use life as inspiration. And being that I travel a lot, and see a lot of different things, and meet a lot of great people, I stay inspired. Shoutout to /r/hiphopheads34. Could you elaborate on your infamous flood story? The legend says that you once had a flood into your basement that caused you to lose a few hundred beats you had made that were meant to be put onto the first round of Wu-Tang solo albums Did this actually happen? Did you recreate any of the beats that you lost? If so, which ones?  RZA - Yeah, I lost a lot of beats. In those days, I would keep my beats in a floppy disk holder, which held 80 disks per case. And I had the cases sectioned out with names of each Wu member, and beats that fit their styles. Those disks have not been recovered yet. I have some of them, but they won't play35. Hey RZA, Huge Fan here, I've been listening to you since I was 10. One question Are you not going to publically publish songs off the new WuTang albulm, or will it only be avaliable to the one lucky buyer?  RZA - The album, that's entitled A Better Tomorrow, if completed, will be available to the public. The album entitled Once Upon A Time in Shaolin is a piece of art that only one will be made36. When was the last time you saw Paul Walker?  RZA - The last time I saw Paul in the flesh was on the movie set. We had planned on seeing each other again at the premiere. But destiny bends37. How awesome is it being a Robert? (Mine name is Robert)  RZA - Super duper awesome38. How did you come up with the name RZA?  RZA - In my neighborhood, my homies would call me the RZA RZA Ra. Because they said I was razor-sharp. Ra was my chosen name, short for Rakeem. When I decided to improve myself, I changed my name to Rakeem Zig-Zag-Zig-Allah. And RZA is like an acronym for that39. What's your favourite videogame?  RZA - Nowadays? Well it's hard to say your favorite video game, but one game I've been buying for years and continue to buy every version they make is Tekken. Actually, when Wu-Tang first started making money, me and Method Man came to Manhattan and went to the place where they sell real pinball machines and video games, and we tried to buy a Tekken to bring home to our house. And they wouldn't sell it to us at that time. Method Man would up getting one though. I wound up getting a pinball machine. Anyway, Tekken40. You get a swimming pool but you can't fill it with water, what do you fill it with? Money is not a choice either  RZA - Those little plastic balls that you see in ball pits41. Liquid Swords II when? Btw Liquid Swords is the greatest Hip-Hop album of all time  RZA - I think GZA may be in the process of writing that nowYou might also like1Embed;

I�m from Lebanon, we raise survivors Train Al-Qaeda snipers, you do drive-bys? We do car bombs like my block's sponsored by Jagermeister, what? I can�t believe they pay you for being such a basic rhymer Safe to say you're 35, you haven�t blown up So you'll never be a fucking famous major label writer You gon' be stuck in the underground for a long time, like a Chilean miner If they put you in a cage, you�d be an amazing fighter He�s a big-ass giant cyclops that hits people from the blind spot like an Asian driver I�m 'bout to get rid of this mathematician with a thousand different algorithms Made up of the foul decisions in life that cloud his vision But what'd knocking them out prove? That if your rounds ain�t hittin' You�ll swing in the middle of the round and hit 'em And show up without a second round like you did out in England And maybe you allowed to, but not in our division Out there they might be proud of you, but I swear to god You show up without a round two, Math, we�re going to beat the living algebra out of you And I ain�t even power tripping, cause rather what I would do is Out-rhyme you and algebraically out-style you Triangulate on all of your ground moves See, the root of the problem is there�s nothing positive about you So I focus on the negatives and try to subtract them out of you Minus all of your foul moves and that�s how you Calculate Matthew�s absolute value, yeah We seen you against Calicoe in New York We seen the whole crowd give up You got booed trying to make your style adjust Your man Cortez battled with Cal, got slumped I seen Hanz try to get in Calicoe�s face and his ass got punked If you take the three of y�all together and you add them up It means half of your squad went against a Cal, got crushed Which proves we'll always be better at Math Cause we would never let a Cal kill us But I know who Hoffa, Math is, got everything dog-shit backwards His bars don�t cause no impact so he starts socking rappers Cause if he had fire, he would go lighter And wouldn�t have to strike 'em on the side like boxing matches Pay attention, if he had fire, lighter, box of matches Yeah, now I sound like all you faggots, hah He�s a fucking nice guy, he�s not even bad, that�s what he wants you to misinterpret He�s like Richard Sherman, he only switches when he gets behind the filming curtain He smiles in your face, then gets on a track and quickly turns into Math, the killing version He�s like Dexter, cause every time he gets in the lab, he becomes a different person, yeah But I�ma tell you now Math, be cool, 'cous I�m serious, Math be cool, Blood You said you gon' smack me, you said Math gon' do what? I seen you the first time, we was chilling with Triune once You stood up in the corner like you was gon' do something Soon as you seen him, you was like, my dude, what's up? Fucking fruit cup I�m trying to show you the large picture No, like serious, Math, I�m trying to show you a large picture No, like pay attention, I�m trying to show you a large picture!  [Round 3: Math Hoffa]  This nigga blew up a picture of me with no shirt on That's some other shit But I bet off of the strength of that picture, tonight, I'ma fuck a bitch But you, you dropped Islam just so you could suck a dick Cause ain't no repercussion for faggots up on the mothership Now let's get real When Pac died, the whole west side fell in depression When B.I.G. died, the whole east side was mentally stressin' See Pac wrote songs that led the black man to progression B.I.G. said, �Sky's The Limit� before his death and ascension But this is why they fear battle rap, cause of how we vent our aggression If that aggression is genuine, this shit could end in a second I still remember the question, is there a ghetto in heaven? I don�t know, but after tonight, there should be a 7/11 I enter the session, calm just to censor the tension For them stacks, I kick that shit, I�m Benjamin Beckham You do a lot of dumb shit just to get some attention It�s like if people think he hard, this nigga gets an erection You a Arab-American bragging 'bout a weapons collection I�m surprised the FBI hasn�t sent an inspection But since you talking guns, them shots gon' be denting your chest in Arabs love oil, he getting drenched with the Wesson See, I came into this battle with the plans of a mover You disappear from where you stand in the future Reappear in the past next to a corn field and hammers�ll shoot ya That�s how you see an end, faggot, Anderson Cooper This suicide, Diz you know you gon' die tonight I�m like a steering wheel in London, I be riding right But this was probably part of your plan, an Al-Qaeda strike What happens when a Arab�s rapping with black dynamite? I rack, putting bodies in Glad bags I can�t even tell my pops what I do, I might get bagged, dad I heard Daylyt really box, and he ain�t half bad But Math jab faster than a Dot Mob ass-grab You been taking Daylyt�s style, give it back, fag Trying to stay ahead of the trend? Guess you a hash-tag You lost on the show and broke out, you was mad sad Ain�t even say bye to your homie, that�s a back-stab I guess your ass really needed the guap Cause you ain�t pay back Marvwon for the meals that he copped Cortez for the weed when you needed some pot You ain�t even pay back Big T when you needed some socks You bum-ass nigga, you gave me writer's block, the worst of this year I watched your battles till your fucking voice was hurting my ears I put the pen to the page, hoping verses appear But this is why I hate Scrabble, sometimes I got no words for these squares I mean, shit be all set, I got my target in sight But the shit I�m wanting to write ain�t part of plight Cause everybody spits the same and y�all reward 'em for bites I�d rather narrate the Wonder Years and talk through your life See, niggas know I spit hard, but they be caught in the hype Vers� Math, you get the draft, either a bar or a fight So Diz gon' stand on the stage and try to offer advice But I�m ten steps ahead like when you walk with your wife I mean, Diz, let�s keep it real, how bad could I be? You took the bargaining price, they paid me top dollar You even paid for part of my flight Last time we spoke, you was broke walking dog in your night So when the fame�s gone, D, you gon' be starving for life You got a broke nigga swag, your face says, �I browse� All these fans and you can�t even count five thou� right now As far as I�m concerned, all of us should be iced out But let�s talk about how you cried out in that Bed Stuy house You told a room full of battle rappers that you wanted to kill yourself Cause you 30 plus and broke and can�t find a way to build your wealth You had the same sweats on for three days, to keep it real or help I slept in my jeans just in case he tried to steal a belt Wake up in the morning smelling curry chicken Diz hanging in the basement like a dummy twitchin� Feeling fucked with no love, that�s the buddy system I told Muhammad treat life like it�s Sonny Liston One of your mans got cancer, and he fighting for life But you'd rather take yours cause you light with your price If I was him, I�d slap your ass twice with a right When we die, we die as men, you gon' die as a dyke All you are is an emotional bitch All you wanted was attention when you told us you quit All you wanted was attention when you told us that shit Your parents raised the blade, you should go for your wrist And when you die as a atheist, and your ghost in the midst And god ask, �Yo, Bachir, who told you to quit? I gave you so many gifts, now I gotta kick his soul to the pit" Spoiled brat, couldn�t adjust after growing up rich Real shit, they�ll never take that from me That�s why a nigga still smile when it ain�t that sunny He was crying cause he broke, ain�t that funny? Well, I give him a couple bucks, that�s that Arab money You fuck rapper, I split you and spill your guts after Look, Ockie, you sloppier than a nut catcher This how Brooklyn do, every time I look at you (I wanna put a fist, knife, bullet, or a foot in you) No, I wanna say, �give me two loosies and a Dutchmaster!� Hoffa  [Round 3: Dizaster]  Yo, how the fuck do you cheer for the type of shit this dude writes?

Okay, you wanna fucking lie, you fucking racist? I�ma hit you with a racist line that�ll leave your mind spinnin' I will make an agreement with you, I�ll agree to cover up all my women If you can agree to cut down on all the fried chicken And for once in your life actually try swimming Let me tell you some shit that y�all didn�t know About Bonnie and Drake, when he was about to take her out on a date Don�t roll your eyes cause you got mad at Bonnie and you started to hate Yo, Drake was about to put Bonnie up in a fucking suite like a little ho Why you think World Domination was booked And we got ourselves a little dough? And the reason why she never met with him is cause He started to act like a little ho, and that�s why she didn�t go And he getting mad cause I�m like Einstein I�m exposing shit about Math that you didn�t know You trip, I let the clip explode, you wanna act like a fricking ho I predict the shit that you gonna say like Charlie Clips when he did the Piccolo You try to throw a jab, I sidestep it and crack Math like the DaVinci Code Stop looking at the fucking phone, you starting to distract me You could play if you want to But don�t think that I ain�t afraid to have one of the homies pull a trey eight and pop you Bro, don�t think I�m afraid to sock you I�m like Edward Scissorhands, I was born with the metal in my hands But you could still catch the fade if you want to Fuck your little fucking metaphor, little four-bar, little schemes I came to destroy y�all regime, I catch a body like nobody has seen And show up to your funeral and stand above your casket And dump metal in your box like a Coinstar machine, yeah And you just mad and all scared Because he thinks I�m come in here touching you Now we see you last time out here, dog You were clearly way uncomfortable Thought it was all Love & Hip Hop till Daylyt got on him Did you see the way he busted you? From far away, that shit look like Stevie J was punking you I�m a war syndicate, I�ll torture your ass You throw a punch and put more force into it than a Morpheus jab There�s not a home item I won�t hit you with I�ll snatch the plates, forks and I�ll stab you with it Till your face warps like the Old Testament Step on mine and you�ll get bone and a frag Once the force of the blast will leave you with torn ligaments Shoulders collapse, bones missing, organs attached to the floor Like your cord's been slashed with a rotary axis from close distance I�m so vicious, I�ll show up to your pad like Jehovah�s Witness And force entry into your door entrance And sulfuric acid your bone remnants till there�s no more evidence For forensics to report to the lab You go from shows with sold tickets to more victims To forgiveness from the mortician to the morgue in the bag From short visits from close friendships to identify your toe with a tag But what good is a mortician when all of your toes missing, body cold as a slab? His corpse shows symptoms of rigor mortis and cold stiffness Like co-defendants in court before the witness Let me show you the math This is the type of hole you diggin' I told him if he shows up trippin', I�ll be forced to hit him Grab him by his throat and kick him Take him to the floor and quickly force submission Push his torso in grab his arm and Kimora twist him Into a choke-hold position like Forrest Griffin, yeah I�ll fucking center in a fire round the home you live in And throw your son in the middle of it like the solar system I�ll expose these cats and leave 'em leaving here out the door straight limpin' I�m down to rustle in the house like Kimora Simmons, yeah Just keep pretending it�s just jealousy and envy It�s that next breed, they surpass him he�s a Cessna engine and they surpassed him like jet speed He knows if he don�t do something they gon' forget him like PS3 So he needed something trendy, why you think he shut down SM3? Everybody from the event flee and Smack lost money on spent fees But you brought this on your own selfie I mean, you brought this on your own self, G You wanted to have all the muscle in the hood You couldn�t be a normal mustang, you just wanted to be a Shelby Cause you're selfish, fuck battling, you should enter UFC You ain�t a real man, a real man respects his enemies A real man uses his verbal skills and only reacts with his hands as a necessity Cause any man can throw a jab effectively But it takes a bigger man to know you the bigger man and to just let it be That�s why you lost all respect from me You could be the knockout MVP, but you�ll never be the best emcee You went your whole life trying to be the one But you just killing yourself over and over like Jet Li He ain�t no motherfucking battling legend He only has one classic battle with Serius and that ain�t no classic He had to stab Smack in the back just to get it You�re wack and pathetic, fuck the fans that respect it You don�t have any ethics, you dissed Cali now you back out west Begging the same people you dissed in the past for acceptance Cause you�re a passive-aggressive, sensitive-ass, feminine faggot Suffering from manic depression who�s mad No one in battle rap wants to give his ass no attention Even his own family rejects him, fuck, Smack don�t respect him He only here cause he got canned, before that, we never seen his ass on the premises So this is all I need to back up all the tracks into evidence The only reason you�re here cause over there you don�t have any relevance You fucking waste of life, I should punch you in your fucking face right now2Embed;

Where Is My Mind? - 2007 Remaster;Pixies;rock; RZA - He slayed it. And everybody knew it. And everybody else tried to slay. But he slayed it2. Did Ol' Dirty really live up to the craziness that he portrayed in his music?   RZA - Times ten3. What happened first, you naming yourself RZA or your cousin naming himself GZA?  RZA - I named myself the RZA first, and I named him the GZA shortly thereafter4. Did anything inspire you with regards to the choice of beats on Enter the 36 Chambers? Also, are you still an avid chess player? :D  RZA - On 36 Chambers, I kind of went on my own inspiration. I was out to prove my abilities. Yes, I still play chess5. Will we ever get 36 chambers remastered?  RZA - Perhaps some of the tracks will be remastered. A lot of them are probably not in multitrack form anymore. So the remaster would still have to come from a stereo mix6. Ever give any thought to writing/directing a Wu Tang Clan movie to tie in with an album?  RZA - Yes, actually. Although making movies is very difficult and it's hard to get green lights, I'm going to keep pushing though. And maybe one day, it will see the light7. Do I still have to protect ma neck? It's been like 20 years now, I'm getting tired of doing it Love you man. As a producer, as a rapper, as an actor, as a videogame character, ANY dj  RZA - You have to protect ya neck til the day you drop brother. Because if you lose ya neck, that will be the day you drop! You must always protect ya neck at all times8. Long time fan of the Wu. I was amazed by the Kill Bill soundtracks Don't know if you can answer this: Will the Ghostface/MF DOOM album ever be released?  RZA - I don't know. But Ghost is one of the dopest MCs, and MF is a dope producer and MC. So I'm sure if they do it, it's going to be great9. What's your favorite movie, and why is it How High?  RZA - Hahahahaheeehohohahaha. Lay off the drugs, cat. LOL10. I have some beat production related questions: - What's your usual setup? All digital? Any analog instruments? Vinyl sampling?   - What DAW do you prefer? -Do you make beats, then send the finished product to rappers to write lyrics to it or do you usually write the song together? - Do you have a specific process for finding samples, or is it all gut feeling? RZA - Well, that's a lot, but: not being egotistic about this, but I have a dozen set ups. And my home studio I use different rooms for setups. So one room is just turntables and a sampler, another would be just keyboards, another will be a digital room, there's one room where everything is analog (live drums, guitars, etc). As a composer, you always need different sounds, so after working with Hans Zimmer, I've learned to use different rooms to write different things or different scenes  I prefer writing songs together. In fact one of the problems with making a Wu-Tang album is my refusal to send beats, because I believe that great music is created when people are in a room together  I dig and I dig, and if something strikes my ear, I sample it. Then I twist it11. PEACE Do you still wear those pointy ass rings and have you ever actually punched a hole in a crab's hand with them?  RZA - No. I gave them to my little brother and I think he lost em12. Do you need to be self aware in order to have sex for enjoyment?  RZA - Uh oh. It's getting deep on AMA. We said AMAA. But now that you asked, you better be aware of yourself and your partner(s)13. How did you like your time on Californication? Samurai Apocalypse was a great foil to Hank Moody  RZA - It was very fun. Funny. And something was very sexy about that show. Maybe it was Meagan. LOL14. Hey RZA! Tell us some funny stories from u and the guys in Wu Tang: )  RZA - Here's a story, it may not be funny depending on your point of view, but one time the whole Clan was in Atlanta, and I guess we caused some kind of riot in the building, and thus the police was brought in to end the show. I remember everybody getting away from the cops without any violence, but one cop had got a grab of Inspector Deck and he couldn't get free. When we noticed it, me and Method Man rushed back over to help, but actually, what could we do? We can't hit a cop, could we? That would not have been wise. Instead, Method Man grabbed onto Inspector Deck's arm, and combined his strength with Inspector Deck, which allowed them to get away from the cop, they broke his grip and we all ran. I later told Meth "That was some Wu-Tang Kung fu shit right there."15. How was working with Earl Sweatshirt? I've heard that during the making of Molasses, you spit a freestyle for three hours  RZA - Yeah, we got zoned out that night. He's a cool cat. And I think he will be a great talent in hiphop16. Hey RZA, how did you become a vegetarian?  RZA - I just snapped out of eating dead animals17. BONG BONG! Been a fan for 20+ years 2 questions: Whats your all time favorite Martial Arts flick? What is your favorite ODB verse/line/metaphor/song?  RZA - I'll tell you the 3 that inspired me the most. Shaolin versus Wu-Tang. 8 Diagram Pole Fighter. And the Five Deadly Venoms For ODB "I be the answer to your why, the tear to your cry." It's off a song he did with Killer Priest18. Who's the best chess player in the Wu Tang Clan right now?  RZA - Hahahahahahaha. All I can say is that I had the hiphop chess belt19. What was it about Gravediggaz, and the horrorcore genre in general, that appealed to you when it was first starting? RZA - At the time, being young and thinking of my childhood nightmares, I wanted to write songs from the darker side of my mentality. I feel like the Gravediggaz are the pioneers of this mentality of lyricism. Hiphop could use a few more doses of it now20. Hey RZA! You seem to be a very calculated, meditative and, for lack of a better word, spiritual person. Was there a certain event in your life that led you to be this way or is this the way you've always been? Peace & thanks for the AMA  RZA - Yes, certain events led me to this, which is hard for me to describe to this, which are hard to describe. But I can say that it was a growth process. Would you believe I was once obnoxious21. Can you share any memories of your tour with Rage Against the Machine?  RZA - That was one of the highlights of my career. At the time, Wu-Tang had the #1 album in the country, and we began playing some of the biggest venues that we had to that date. One of my best memories is when Zack broke his leg on tour, and needed a little energy during the New Jersey show, and I came out and rocked the stage with him. The rest of the Wu went home. :(22. Have you considered being on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast? I can't remember if it was a tweet or during his own AMA, but Rogan said he would love to have you on as a guest  RZA - Yes, I would love to be on as a guest someday. I'll wait for the time for him to invite me23. Hey RZA! really glad you're doing this AMA. I read somewhere that you and John Frusciante have recorded a ton of material. I really liked FM. Any chance you two might release a full album in the future? That would be awesome  RZA - here's a chance for that. If life permits24. actor in Brick Mansions. AMAA Hey hey now, let's not forget the awesome performance in "The Man with the Iron Fists!" Good job man. How much fun is it being so versatile?  RZA - It's very challenging. Because some of my friends are thinking I'm becoming a little schizo. Wow, the life of an artist25. I was recently in a yoga class and the instructor said "protect your neck" and I immediately thought of Wu-Tang and giggled to myself. What do you think about a rap-inspired yoga class? Would bring a whole new meaning to "flow."  RZA - LOL26. Many critics believe double albums usually contain filler and do not hold them as in high of regard as they could and should be. What would you say were the main reasons "Wu-Tang Forever" was made into a Double album instead of 2 different albums with a later release date for songs not used on first album? Was some of the inspiration for making it a double album taken from the success of "All Eyez on Me" or more that you wanted to get more music out?  RZA - Actually, a double-album was part creative, and part business. If i can recall, we hadn't done an album as Wu-Tang Clan for four years. And so we wanted to give Steve Rifkin an abundant amount of material. But also we demanded a budget so high that to appease it, they said "how about a double album?"27. Prince Rakeem! Just wanted to give you a shout out for saving my life (or at least my wallet) way back when 12 years ago, I�m serving a Mormon mission in Brazil. I�m assigned to a poverty stricken area of Curitiba, a city of about 2 million people. I�m 20 years old, young enough to think I�m invincible and stupid enough to not heed the advice to stay out of this particular neighborhood. This is one of those �favelas� that you hear about in the news. Houses made of plywood, cardboard and tarp; a river of feces, trash and decaying dog carcasses; red dirt roads that turn into streams during rainstorms and a whole lot of people walking around that didn�t really have anything to do other than observe those who didn�t belong. This is the same place where you read about nightly murders in the newspaper. The problem was, this neighborhood was right in the middle of our area and it made it difficult to get from one side to the other without passing through. Although my mission companion and I had been through the neighborhood a handful of times during the day, we had never ventured to pass through at night Well, this night a meeting of ours goes particularly late at night and we are dead tired after a long day. From where we were, we were going to have to walk around the outside of the favela to get home and that was about an hour-long walk. Instead, we decide to cut through the favela to cut it down to about 20 minutes. At first, the decision seems like the right one. The moonlight is blanketing the road, the night is freezing but still, and even though there is always the lingering stench of rotting dogs, it just isn�t that bad tonight. The road we choose to walk down is the same one we�ve used in the past, but now that it�s night I start to realize some things I hadn�t before. The road is like a chute, without any roads intersecting it. It�s like a long hallway of back-to-back shanties and decaying cement buildings with no exit other than the two ends. As we walk, I start to see figures in the shadows ahead on both sides of the road. As we get closer, the figures start to meander to the middle of the road. My companion, who has only been in Brazil for about a month is oblivious to anything going on. I casually look behind me to reconsider our choice of road, and I see five figures, evenly spaced across the road, walking toward us. I turn back and see the figures ahead of us have formed a line across the road as well. By this point, even my na�ve little friend knows we�re screwed. As we approach the group I notice that the men all wearing heavy black clothing: big coats, baggy jeans, boots, hoodies, winter caps. But one detail struck me immediately. All of them are wearing at least one article of clothing bearing an emblem I knew very well. It was the Wu-Tang logo. Mind you, I was obsessed with Wu-Tang in high school and knew pretty much anything there was to know about the group. As we stop, looking the men in the face, the lines of men behind and in front of us meet to form a circle around us. The man directly in front of us asks, �Perdidos?� and the man to his left reaches into his coat and begins to pull out what looks like the back of a black semi-automatic handgun. Before he pulls the gun from his coat, I almost subconsciously blurt out the only thing I could think to say: in Portuguese, I ask �You guys are Wu-Tang fans?� The man pulling the gun immediately pauses. The man who first spoke asks �What do YOU know about Wu-Tang?� I respond by telling him that I�m a huge fan and I know all about them. Obviously they doubt everything I�m saying. After all, I�m a white kid, wearing a white shirt and tie, with a part in my hair. At that moment I began to realize how I wouldn�t believe myself either. They begin to quiz me! One thing after another�names, nicknames, alternate names, rapping styles�I�m nailing it all! After about 10 minutes of Wu-Tang trivia, they�re convinced and they ask us to come back to one of the guy�s house to watch the latest video. They told us repeatedly how we were the coolest white people they knew From that day on, we were in with the local gang and you really don�t know just how good of a thing that was Edit: Thank you for reading this novel and spreading the love, gold-wielding friend--whoever you are Edit 2: Someone below asked if there was more to the story. If your eyes can take a little more reading, I explained how the night ended here  RZA - Wow I always believed that us who follow the way of the Wu have a wavelength and a culture of our own. Something like a subculture within hiphop. This story helps verify that for me. Wu-Tang forever brother28. Will you ever release a real true solo wu sounding album just like the others did in the 90's??? not discrediting the bobby digital stuff, i like that but a lot of wu fans felt it wasn't a true representation of the 90's rza, hard body lyrics and dusty beats, will that ever happen or does everything need to move forward? i jst wish i had a rza album full of songs like Tragedy RZA - Hmm. Maybe brother, maybe29. Wu-Tang Forever! How much have comic books influenced you? I still smile every time I hear you name drop Rom, The Space Knight on Impossible  RZA - From the age of 9-16, I probably collected thousands of comics. But they all got stolen one day, along with my vinyl collection. And I'm telling you, I used to spend my paper route money on this stuff. I'm still a comic fan. Every once in a while, if I'm in a certain city and they have a comic book store, I will go and pick up a few copies. I love how the new artists are doing the new covers, Grant Morrison's take on classic heroes has always been cool to me, and I actually bought every copy of Reginald Hudlin's new take on the Black Panther30. Whattup Rza huge Wu Fan and personally you are my favourite producer ever!Thank you for doing this, I have a few questions actually, my first question regards the tracks Method Man and Clan In Da front, Did you tailor a beat for every member in the clan, how did you choose who got their solo songs on the album?Who are your other favourite rapper-producers?Lastly are there any beats that once you had finished then played back you realised that it was going to be a classic.Once again thank you!  RZA - Yes, I used to tailor the beats to their rhyme styles. I knew my Wu brothers for so long, and made so many tapes with them, that I grew an ear to what would fit the MC Choosing solo songs for each artist on a Wu-Tang album is something that kind of materializes during the process Pete Rock, Dr. Dre, Kanye West Yes, I have one right now that I just can't wait til the Wu MCs get on, because I just know that this is one of those magical ones31. Which rappers are you listening to the most outside of your Wu-Tang crew?  RZA - Nowadays, I've just become a fan of the culture of hiphop. Somedays I find myself sitting on my downtime watching Yo! MTV raps, or scrolling through YouTube finding up and coming MCs. I love watching URL and all the rap battles. Sometimes when you're making the music, you become so engulfed in yourself that you forget that you started yourself as a fan of the music. Now that I get time to do other things such as act, score and direct, I can actually become a fan of hiphop again32. What is your relationship with Bill Murray like? You guys were in Coffee and Cigarettes in 2003, and then in 2010, this happened. Do you still talk?  RZA - I don't talk to him often, because we both have crazy-busy schedules, but we have a similar circle of friends. What I can say is what a cool dude33. What's good RZA. First shoutout to /r/hiphopheads. How do you stay creative as you do lyrically and production wise?  RZA - I use life as inspiration. And being that I travel a lot, and see a lot of different things, and meet a lot of great people, I stay inspired. Shoutout to /r/hiphopheads34. Could you elaborate on your infamous flood story? The legend says that you once had a flood into your basement that caused you to lose a few hundred beats you had made that were meant to be put onto the first round of Wu-Tang solo albums Did this actually happen? Did you recreate any of the beats that you lost? If so, which ones?  RZA - Yeah, I lost a lot of beats. In those days, I would keep my beats in a floppy disk holder, which held 80 disks per case. And I had the cases sectioned out with names of each Wu member, and beats that fit their styles. Those disks have not been recovered yet. I have some of them, but they won't play35. Hey RZA, Huge Fan here, I've been listening to you since I was 10. One question Are you not going to publically publish songs off the new WuTang albulm, or will it only be avaliable to the one lucky buyer?  RZA - The album, that's entitled A Better Tomorrow, if completed, will be available to the public. The album entitled Once Upon A Time in Shaolin is a piece of art that only one will be made36. When was the last time you saw Paul Walker?  RZA - The last time I saw Paul in the flesh was on the movie set. We had planned on seeing each other again at the premiere. But destiny bends37. How awesome is it being a Robert? (Mine name is Robert)  RZA - Super duper awesome38. How did you come up with the name RZA?  RZA - In my neighborhood, my homies would call me the RZA RZA Ra. Because they said I was razor-sharp. Ra was my chosen name, short for Rakeem. When I decided to improve myself, I changed my name to Rakeem Zig-Zag-Zig-Allah. And RZA is like an acronym for that39. What's your favourite videogame?  RZA - Nowadays? Well it's hard to say your favorite video game, but one game I've been buying for years and continue to buy every version they make is Tekken. Actually, when Wu-Tang first started making money, me and Method Man came to Manhattan and went to the place where they sell real pinball machines and video games, and we tried to buy a Tekken to bring home to our house. And they wouldn't sell it to us at that time. Method Man would up getting one though. I wound up getting a pinball machine. Anyway, Tekken40. You get a swimming pool but you can't fill it with water, what do you fill it with? Money is not a choice either  RZA - Those little plastic balls that you see in ball pits41. Liquid Swords II when? Btw Liquid Swords is the greatest Hip-Hop album of all time  RZA - I think GZA may be in the process of writing that nowYou might also like1Embed;

Won't Get Fooled Again - Original Album Version;The Who;rock; To escape, I start taking ecstasy in copious quantities, and because I have an allergy to alcohol, take lots and lots of pills, pills, and more pills (downers are like speed to my system, they calm me down and wake me up)�the very idea of standing in the practice space and playing rock riffs makes me sad and sick to my stomach�I don�t so much want to make music for what I am dealing with inside as much as what I am dealing with inside only leaves me wanting to make mournful music, or better yet, no music at all�old, dear friends plead with me to take some time off�but I do not know what to do with myself�music is my way of coping with my feelings, but making music forces me to deal with situations, people, and places I am not always prepared to face�I hole up in my Victorian house in Chicago, and get to work�it eases my mind to stay busy�I mostly just sit around, play acoustic guitar, watch t.v., and write what I call �little� songs�simple songs that don�t need the power of the band behind them�I have a spare bedroom upstairs in the back that I use to make demos�the songs have sort of a lazy charm, I like them, and they gently touch at what I am trying to say (which is to try to find some hope in all this buried pain)�I�m supposed to be happy, I am on top of the world (materially speaking), and yet I feel like a deposed king, as if I am no longer running my kingdom, but instead it is running me�I really have become a �rat in the cage��fans sit outside my house and wait for me at all hours of the day�sometimes people sneak up on me from behind bushes�I have 3 stalkers, one who rights letters about how he dreams at night of me raping him (we have to call the police)�people fuck on my lawn (and brag about it to other fans), steal my garbage and post the contents on the internet, or, ha-ha-ha, smash pumpkins on my porch�I have the constant feeling people are watching me in my house� I try at all times to avoid the windows, or I pull my shades down on sunny days�it feels like a state of siege, and I try to just stay numb as best I know how�work is the one place I feel safe�  James, D�arcy, and I go in to Chicago Recording Company with Matt Walker on drums, and over about 3-4 days quickly lay down some of my new tunes�(the Adore album version of �Annie-dog� is recorded live in these sessions, as is the first run thru of �for Martha� without the lyrics)�James and D�arcy and Matt play really great (we record live), and seem to like and appreciate the new songs�the lack of any outside pressures, the laid back atmosphere, seem to suit everyone�s mood and we are optimistic that this is going to be a quicker, less painful album to make (my original estimate was it would take all of 6 weeks to record Adore-Mellon Collie had taken 8 months)�buoyed by the latest work, I make plans to start the album �for real��I want everything to be recorded live, or if not totally live, be done really quickly�I am inspired by Bob Dylan�s approach from the 1960�s where you just when in and did your songs really fast (1 or 2 takes)�I tell myself this is what has been missing from the band, this sense of freedom and spontanaiety�  My girlfriend and I decide to take a vacation to the Bahamas�as we sit in the shade at the beach, all I can talk about is the kind of album I want to make, and how I feel unsure if it is such a good idea�the demo sessions (even though I was happy with them) hinted at a softer, more acoustic approach, which in and of itself is not that radical of an idea�my mind, working overtime, wonders if the new music is not progressive enough (one of the main charters for the band, to push ahead ceaselessly)�always having had an interest in electronic music, I can hear in my head a new melding of the two feelings (acoustic and electronic)�this excites me as a new direction, but at the same time, something in my gut tells me it isn�t such a good idea�I can�t make up my mind, so I keep talking about what I should do�my girlfriend grows tired of hearing me drone on about it, until finally she snaps, yelling at me that if it is what I want to do it that I should just do it or stop talking about it�without pausing for a second, I say �alright, I will do it�, and the matter is made up in my mind for good� in my messed thinking, I figure I will make this grand anti-statement against the grand statement I just finished making on the last record� this is totally dysfunctional logic, and without realizing it, I am preparing for yet another suicide�except this one will be career suicide�it will prove to be my way to shatter everything around me�(and in that way, it will prove to be a total success)�  I take a planned trip to Istanbul, Turkey�without doing any research, I have decided to come here just on a gut feeling that this is somewhere I should visit�I am not sure why I must come, I just trust that I must�my girlfriend comes with me, and we check into a 5 star hotel, which unknown to me before I arrive, is located in a former prison where they used to torture people (famously portrayed in the 70�s movie �Midnight Express�)�bad omen ..1 of 47�the city, formerly known as Constantinople, was once the crossroads of the world, and the capital of the Holy Roman Empire�the architecture is incredible, and the history breathtaking�there is only one problem�the people are generally horrible to us (this is pre 9/11)�everywhere we go we are met with racist anti-American sentiments�of course, some people are warm and friendly, and we even make friends with a restauranteur who shows us around (he recognized me, a bet my girlfriend lost when she bet no one would recognize me in Turkey the whole time�a bet she lost 4 hours after our arrival in the country)�but overall, the feeling is one of menace, that constant feeling that you are not welcome�food is shoved at us, men grab their dicks and make leering comments to my partner, and she is even physically attacked on the street by someone for no reason�it is a nightmare vacation�I withdraw, and don�t want to even leave the hotel room�for the life of me, I cannot figure out why have brought us here�  Each morning at 4:45 is the first call to prayer�the hotel is located just next to the Haga Sophia, which is one of the most famous mosques in the world�so it figures that the man doing the sing-song call to prayer in the morning would be one of the best in the land�it is so hard to describe, but this man singing is like Jimi Hendrix (playing the national anthem) with his voice�when he starts up, so do another 100 mosques as well�the whole city lights up with sound, and in my half-awake state, feel this man singing (to me right) thru my soul�he is distorting his voice with the colour of 2,000 years�and then it hits me, the sound I am seeking for the record�the ancient sound of life and love mixed with a overloaded distortion that is earthen�the sound of this man singing becomes my template for the sound of Adore�now I know why we are here�  We are having such a rotten time that we decide to cut our trip short�our flight out is in the afternoon, so we get up early, take all the dishes and other goodies we had bought at the ancient market to the front desk (to be shipped back home), and hit the town one last time�we have put off Haga Sophia until the end, because being the most famous destination, figure it will also be the most crowded�as we are walking into the mosque complex, I am verbally attacked by a street vendor for refusing to acknowledge his sales pitch (in various languages no less)��yankee go home, fuck you, fuck America�American piece-a-shit��after 10 days of this nonsense, I snap, and am ready to punch this guys lights out�suddenly, it is me and 4 of his friends�things get really out of hand, and as we go inside I can�t even enjoy the immense beauty of the place�I am standing at the crossroads of history and all I can think about is how I am gonna get my ass kicked the moment I step out of the door�so much beauty, and so much ugliness�all the warning signs of what is to come are here for me to see�my future, my past, our future, our past, all mixed with my �rockstar� disconnection from reality�sadly, I ignore, or don�t see, all these signs�(when we get back to Chicago, all the dishes arrive shattered into a million pieces)  Supposedly now rested, I foolishly decide we are going to move to a new studio each and every week (6 weeks, 6 studios) to keep things fresh�this means packing up everything and moving guitars, wires, amps, all sorts of shit each time�this in theory sounds good for creativity (the keep it moving theory), but will bring to bear all sorts of technical issues (which prove to really bog the sessions down)�I hire Brad Wood, for co-producer, from his great work on Liz Phair and Red Red Meat, because I think he will help me get the sound I am looking for�everything is set to go, we don�t even rehearse, we are just going to learn the songs on the fly.  The first day we in, I meet the new pro-tools guy, Bjorn (little do I know that we will not only work together on my next 4 albums, but he will also become a close friend)�the first song we are going to record is a beautiful acoustic song that I envision will begin the album�James and D�arcy are not even in the studio when I start working (this is fairly typical)�I have bought an old Martin nylon string guitar just to record this particular tune�however, the guitar won�t tune right, and every time I go to the d chord, the darn thing is out of tune�too late!! Time to record�I decide I am going to record the guitar and vocals live, with no click track�when I start that first take, my whole body is shaking�I have totally put myself on the spot like never before�I feel terrified, like I am going over a cliff, and there is no one here to stop me (or catch me!)�Bjorn later told me that as I was playing, Brad Wood was bragging to him and the other engineers in the control room how much free equipment he had gotten by dropping the Pumpkins name (instead of listening to the take)�when I finished, I asked Brad how it was, he whirred around, pressed the talkback button said �that was great!� (and in that very first hour, we recorded �To Sheila�)  the general idea was a good one, to record one song per day, and in the beginning of the sessions this proved to be exciting and stimulating�I was mostly just working by myself, as it was easier and quicker and less stressful�after so many years of a passive-aggressive relationship of who plays what, and when (and how), James and D�arcy now knew to just get out of my way�Matt was my new partner, and stood by my side a lot as I navigated all these new ideas�he was truly wonderful, and supportive of me, and encouraged me to keep taking chances�The beginning of these sessions felt magical, like a whole new world of possibility had opened up�long before we had even started the album, an electronic song that I had done for the movie �Lost Highway� had been a hit (the song �eye�)�this added to the sense that I felt I could do no wrong�everything I touched (for about 5 years) seemed to literally turn to gold�this created a sense that I could do whatever I wanted, , and go wherever I wanted, and now I was going to tackle some sort of futuristic, electronic folk-rock (and it would sell too!)�but as often happens to an idea whose foundation is not based on pure intent, I ran out of gas fairly quickly�I slowly found that Brad, my supposed co-producer, wasn�t contributing much to the songs�I was used to guys like Flood, and Butch, who thought the song you were singing was everything�Brad was more of a �interesting type sounds guy��and is often the case in the indie world, he was used to using clever production to cover up weak writing�but this left him without the skills to know how to get out of the way when a song was great (which a few of these songs were)�I grew more and more isolated as the days went by�I didn�t have Jimmy there to keep my spirits up (and also take the music to a higher level)�it had become James and D�arcy vs. me in the power department, and their opinion centered more on a �we�re tired, let�s take some time off� vibe than what would be best for the album�instead of taking stock of my own misgivings, or insecurities, I started to look for someone or something to blame for my lack of resolve�the long, slow tailspin started about 2 or 3 weeks in�instead of backing up, and seeing the writing on the wall, I got even more determined and stubborn, and just pressed myself harder�and sadly, stopped listening to anybody�  However, there were times in those first 6 weeks where the hassle was all worth it�the most magical moment of these first sessions came when we were set to record a long instrumental piece, at that time called �48 chords� (notable for the fact that the chord sequence did not uniquely repeat until 48 successive chords were played)�up until that point, I had not dealt with my divorce in any of the new songs, which I thought was odd considering the bitter fallout, but I blamed it on the fact that I was in a fairly new relationship and maybe just didn�t feel like getting into it (my girlfriend at the time forbade me to speak of my marriage)�I woke up early on a crisp, sunny morning, and reeled off a stream of consciousness type poem that seemed very much to deal with my anger towards my ex-wife�this surprised me, but I thought little more of it once I got in the shower�I typed it up, and put it in my pocket thinking I might rip off some of the better lines for a song as yet unwritten�I got to the studio, we miked up the piano, and fairly quickly nailed the long sequence of chords (I kept time by playing to a whole series of delays)�the basic concept is that I would put some guitar and strings over the top of it, creating a piece like something for a movie (one of the original ideas for Adore is that it would sound and feel more like a movie score, with instrumentals interspersed amongst the �sung� songs�) when I went into the control room, for some reason I pulled the poem out of my pocket while the boys were busy doing something technical, I started to sing the lines of the poem without much thought, and it was like something out of a dream�suddenly, the song rushed upon me, coming quicker than I could think it up�I got really excited, and ran out to a vocal microphone��hurry, hurry, I pleaded�, fearful the feeling and the thought I was in would leave my body and never return�over the next 20 minutes, working line by line, I �laid� out the entire song�sadly, every time I asked Brad a question, he didn�t seem to have a solid answer, or feel as excited as I did about the piece�it was like I was trying to convince somebody their meal tastes better than it does�he just wasn�t �with� me, in lockstep�here I was, having one of the most exciting moments of my recording life, and I feel like I am in a boat by myself in the middle of the ocean�there was no one else to turn to at that moment (again, no band in the studio)�by the time I had finished singing all the lines, I had my mind made up�Brad would have to go�  Feeling restless and uncertain, I start to blame Chicago for the gray clouds hanging over the sessions�maybe it is my past here, far too many shadows and people rooting against me�everywhere I drive in Chicago I am reminded of my many failures�I was already paranoid (from years of self-denial), and couldn�t accept that I was in way over my head�in addition, my girlfriend really disliked Chicago, and didn�t want to spend any time there�I figured that if we all relocated, she would be happier (and come stay with me thru the end of recording)�I could get some support, the band could get some sun, and all would �instantly� improve!�so of all places to get centered, and find the heart of this album, I choose lovely, spiritually grounded Los Angeles, California�(look out Hollywood, here I come)Embed;

And Dr. Dre said Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha) Feminist women love Eminem "Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady,I'm sick of him Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what Flippin' the you-know-who", "Yeah, but he's so cute though" Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose "My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips" And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss And that's the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is By the time they hit fourth gradethey've got the Discovery Channel, don't they? We ain't nothin' but mammals Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes See Eminem LiveGet tickets as low as $190You might also like I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up?
